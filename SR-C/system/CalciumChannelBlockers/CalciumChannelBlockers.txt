TI  - A calcium antagonist vs a non-calcium antagonist hypertension treatment strategy 
      for patients with coronary artery disease. The International
      Verapamil-Trandolapril Study (INVEST): a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2805-16
AB  - CONTEXT: Despite evidence of efficacy of antihypertensive agents in treating
      hypertensive patients, safety and efficacy of antihypertensive agents for
      coronary artery disease (CAD) have been discerned only from subgroup analyses in 
      large trials. OBJECTIVE: To compare mortality and morbidity outcomes in patients 
      with hypertension and CAD treated with a calcium antagonist strategy (CAS) or a
      non-calcium antagonist strategy (NCAS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
      Randomized, open label, blinded end point study of 22 576 hypertensive CAD
      patients aged 50 years or older, which was conducted September 1997 to February
      2003 at 862 sites in 14 countries. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned
      to either CAS (verapamil sustained release) or NCAS (atenolol). Strategies
      specified dose and additional drug regimens. Trandolapril and/or
      hydrochlorothiazide was administered to achieve blood pressure goals according to
      guidelines from the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention,
      Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) of less than
      140 mm Hg (systolic) and less than 90 mm Hg (diastolic); and less than 130 mm Hg 
      (systolic) and less than 85 mm Hg (diastolic) if diabetes or renal impairment was
      present. Trandolapril was also recommended for patients with heart failure,
      diabetes, or renal impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: first occurrence
      of death (all cause), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; other: 
      cardiovascular death, angina, adverse experiences, hospitalizations, and blood
      pressure control at 24 months. RESULTS: At 24 months, in the CAS group, 6391
      patients (81.5%) were taking verapamil sustained release; 4934 (62.9%) were
      taking trandolapril; and 3430 (43.7%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide. In the
      NCAS group, 6083 patients (77.5%) were taking atenolol; 4733 (60.3%) were taking 
      hydrochlorothiazide; and 4113 (52.4%) were taking trandolapril. After a follow-up
      of 61 835 patient-years (mean, 2.7 years per patient), 2269 patients had a
      primary outcome event with no statistically significant difference between
      treatment strategies (9.93% in CAS and 10.17% in NCAS; relative risk [RR], 0.98; 
      95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.06). Two-year blood pressure control was
      similar between groups. The JNC VI blood pressure goals were achieved by 65.0%
      (systolic) and 88.5% (diastolic) of CAS and 64.0% (systolic) and 88.1%
      (diastolic) of NCAS patients. A total of 71.7% of CAS and 70.7% of NCAS patients 
      achieved a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood
      pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. CONCLUSION: The verapamil-trandolapril-based
      strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based
      strategy in hypertensive CAD patients.

TI  - Relation between use of antihypertensive medications and risk of breast carcinoma
      among women ages 65-79 years.
PG  - 1504-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited data are available regarding the incidence of breast
      carcinoma among users of relatively recently introduced forms of antihypertensive
      therapy. Although it has been suggested that women who have taken calcium channel
      blockers (CCBs) have an increased risk and that women who have taken
      angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a decreased risk,
      currently, no conclusions can be drawn. METHODS: A population-based case-control 
      study of women ages 65-79 years was conducted in western Washington State. The
      responses of 975 women who were diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma during
      1997-1999 were compared with the responses of 1007 women in a control group.
      Associations between use of different types of antihypertensive medications and
      breast carcinoma incidence were evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS:
      Overall, women who had ever used CCBs, beta-blockers, or ACE inhibitors did not
      have an altered risk of breast carcinoma relative to women who had never used
      antihypertensive medications. Although the use of immediate-release CCBs,
      thiazide diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics was associated with modestly 
      increased risks of breast carcinoma (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence
      interval [95% CI], 1.0-2.1; OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8; and OR, 1.6; 95% CI,
      1.2-2.1, respectively), the absence of any trend in the size of excess risk with 
      increasing duration or with current versus former use of these agents argues for 
      a cautious interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: The use of particular types of
      antihypertensive medications, including immediate-release CCBs and certain
      diuretics, may increase the risk of breast carcinoma among older women.
      Additional studies are warranted to clarify these potential associations. Cancer

TI  - Principal results of the Controlled Onset Verapamil Investigation of
      Cardiovascular End Points (CONVINCE) trial.
PG  - 2073-82
AB  - CONTEXT: Hypertensive patients are often given a calcium antagonist to reduce
      cardiovascular disease risk, but the benefit compared with other drug classes is 
      controversial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether initial therapy with
      controlled-onset extended-release (COER) verapamil is equivalent to a physician's
      choice of atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular disease.
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind, randomized clinical trial
      conducted at 661 centers in 15 countries. A total of 16 602 participants
      diagnosed as having hypertension and who had 1 or more additional risk factors
      for cardiovascular disease were enrolled between September 1996 and December 1998
      and followed up until December 31, 2000. After a mean of 3 years of follow-up,
      the sponsor closed the study before unblinding the results. INTERVENTION:
      Initially, 8241 participants received 180 mg of COER verapamil and 8361 received 
      either 50 mg of atenolol or 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Other drugs (eg,
      diuretic, beta-blocker, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) could be
      added in specified sequence if needed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First occurrence of
      stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease-related death. RESULTS: 
      Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by 13.6 mm Hg and 7.8 mm Hg
      for participants assigned to the COER verapamil group and by 13.5 and 7.1 mm Hg
      for partcipants assigned to the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group. There were
      364 primary cardiovascular disease-related events that occurred in the COER
      verapamil group vs 365 in atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (hazard ratio
      [HR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.18; P =.77). For fatal or
      nonfatal stroke, the HR was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.90-1.48); for fatal or nonfatal
      myocardial infarction, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.65-1.03); and for cardiovascular
      disease-related death, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.37). The HR was 1.05 (95% CI,
      0.95-1.16) for any prespecified cardiovascular disease-related event and 1.08
      (95% CI, 0.93-1.26) for all-cause mortality. Nonstroke hemorrhage was more common
      with participants in the COER-verapamil group (n = 118) compared with the
      atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (n = 79) (HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.16-2.04]; P
      =.003). More cardiovascular disease-related events occurred between 6 AM and noon
      in both the COER verapamil (99/277) and atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide (88/274) 
      groups; HR, 1.15 (95% CI, 0.86-1.53). CONCLUSIONS: The CONVINCE trial did not
      demonstrate equivalence of a COER verapamil-based antihypertensive regimen
      compared with a regimen beginning with a diuretic or beta-blocker. When
      considered in the context of other trials of calcium antagonists, these data
      indicate that the effectiveness of calcium-channel therapy in reducing
      cardiovascular disease is similar but not better than diuretic or beta-blocker
      treatment.

TI  - Outcomes with nifedipine GITS or Co-amilozide in hypertensive diabetics and
      nondiabetics in Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension (INSIGHT).
PG  - 431-6
AB  - To investigate the impact of treatment on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity,
      we assessed outcomes in patients with hypertension and diabetes who received
      co-amilozide or nifedipine in the International Nifedipine GITS Study:
      Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension. Participants had to be 55 to 80 years of 
      age, with hypertension (> or =150/95 or > or =160 mm Hg) and at least one
      additional cardiovascular risk factor. Patients received 30 mg nifedipine once
      daily or co-amilozide (25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 2.5 mg amiloride) daily.
      Doses were doubled if target blood pressures (<140/90 mm Hg) were not achieved.
      Primary (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure,
      and stroke) and secondary outcomes (composite of primary outcomes, including
      all-cause mortality and death from vascular and nonvascular causes) were assessed
      by means of intent-to-treat analyses. There was no significant difference in the 
      incidence of primary outcomes between nifedipine-treated and co-amilozide-treated
      patients with diabetes at baseline (n=1302) (8.3% versus 8.4%; relative risk,
      0.99, 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.42; P=1.00). A significant benefit for nifedipine-treated
      patients was seen for the composite secondary outcome (14.2% versus 18.7%;
      relative risk, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.97; P=0.03). Among patients without
      diabetes at baseline (n=5019), there was a significant difference in the
      incidence of new diabetes (nifedipine 4.3% versus co-amilozide 5.6%, P=0.023).
      Nifedipine GITS once daily is as effective as diuretic therapy in reducing
      cardiovascular complications in hypertensive diabetics. Nifedipine-treated
      patients were also less likely to have diabetes or have secondary events (a
      composite of all-cause mortality, death from a vascular cause, and death from a
      nonvascular cause) than co-amilozide recipients. Our results suggest that
      nifedipine could be considered as first-line therapy for hypertensive diabetics.

TI  - Verapamil is associated with an increased risk of cancer in the elderly: the
      Rotterdam study.
PG  - 98-105
AB  - The association between the use of calcium channel blockers (CCB) and cancer has 
      received ample attention, but is still controversial. In this study, we have
      tested the hypothesis that the observed association between CCB and cancer in
      earlier studies could be explained by residual confounding or by
      misclassification of exposure because of the use of cross-sectional data on drug 
      use. Data from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study
      in the municipal area Ommoord, were used. The study population consisted of a
      cohort of 3204 participants aged 71 years or older who were followed from a
      baseline interview in the period 1991-1993 for the occurrence of incident cancer.
      Data on drug use were gathered at baseline and through the seven community
      pharmacies which served the Ommoord region during the study period between 1
      January 1991 and 1 January 1999. Incident cancer events were gathered from a
      nationwide registry of hospitalisation data and from a specialised cancer centre 
      in the Rotterdam region. We performed three analyses. First, we followed the
      method, and adjusted for the same risk factors, as in the earlier studies. In the
      second analysis, we included all risk factors that were univariately associated
      with cancer in the Rotterdam Study. In the third analysis, we included exposure
      to CCBs as time-varying co-variates, while adjusting for potential confounders.
      The relative risk (RR) of cancer associated with CCB was 1.4 (95% Confidence
      Interval (CI): 0.9-2.0) in the first analysis and lowered to 1.2 (95% CI:
      0.8-1.8) upon adjustment for the different co-variates in the second. In both
      analyses, however, verapamil was significantly associated with cancer with RRs of
      2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.0) and 2.0 (1.01-3.9), respectively, whereas no associations
      were found with the other CCB in this study, i.e. diltiazem and nifedipine. A
      significantly increased risk of cancer was found for intermediate daily doses of 
      verapamil and diltiazem. Intake of other antihypertensives such as beta-blocking 
      agents, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors was not associated with cancer. In the third
      analysis with exposure to CCB as time-varying co-variates, the risk increase was 
      non-significant for use of 2 years or less, 1.0 (95% CI: 0.7-1.5), and for use
      for a cumulative period of more than 2 years, 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.0). However, in 
      all models the hazard ratio was statistically significantly increased for
      verapamil, but not for diltiazem and nifedipine. On the basis of these analyses, 
      we found no increase in cancer in users of diltiazem and nifedipine, nor in users
      of other antihypertensives. In line with earlier studies, however, we found an
      increased risk of cancer in users of verapamil. At variance with the conclusions 
      from several other studies, we think that it is too early to conclude that CCB
      are not associated with cancer.

TI  - Major outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients randomized to
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker vs diuretic:
      The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial
      (ALLHAT).
PG  - 2981-97
AB  - CONTEXT: Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce
      hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, but the optimal first-step therapy 
      is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with a calcium channel
      blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lowers the incidence of
      coronary heart disease (CHD) or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) events vs
      treatment with a diuretic. DESIGN: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering
      Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind,
      active-controlled clinical trial conducted from February 1994 through March 2002.
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 33 357 participants aged 55 years or older
      with hypertension and at least 1 other CHD risk factor from 623 North American
      centers. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive
      chlorthalidone, 12.5 to 25 mg/d (n = 15 255); amlodipine, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n =
      9048); or lisinopril, 10 to 40 mg/d (n = 9054) for planned follow-up of
      approximately 4 to 8 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was
      combined fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by
      intent-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined
      CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with
      hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without 
      hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease). RESULTS:
      Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, 
      with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate,
      11.5%), the relative risks (RRs) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine
      (6-year rate, 11.3%) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate,
      11.4%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year
      systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, 
      P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P<.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and
      5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm
      Hg, P<.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar
      except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38;
      95% CI, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher
      6-year rates of combined CVD (33.3% vs 30.9%; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16);
      stroke (6.3% vs 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30); and HF (8.7% vs 7.7%; RR,
      1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31). CONCLUSION: Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in
      preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD and are less expensive. They should be
      preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy.

TI  - Effect of blood pressure lowering and antihypertensive drug class on progression 
      of hypertensive kidney disease: results from the AASK trial.
PG  - 2421-31
AB  - CONTEXT: Hypertension is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the
      United States, with no known treatment to prevent progressive declines leading to
      ESRD. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of 2 levels of blood pressure (BP)
      control and 3 antihypertensive drug classes on glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
      decline in hypertension. DESIGN: Randomized 3 x 2 factorial trial with enrollment
      from February 1995 to September 1998. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1094
      African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease (GFR, 20-65
      mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) were recruited from 21 clinical centers throughout the
      United States and followed up for 3 to 6.4 years. INTERVENTIONS: Participants
      were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 mean arterial pressure goals, 102 to 107 mm Hg
      (usual; n = 554) or 92 mm Hg or less (lower; n = 540), and to initial treatment
      with either a beta-blocker (metoprolol 50-200 mg/d; n = 441), an
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril 2.5-10 mg/d; n = 436) or a
      dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, (amlodipine 5-10 mg/d; n = 217).
      Open-label agents were added to achieve the assigned BP goals. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Rate of change in GFR (GFR slope); clinical composite outcome of
      reduction in GFR by 50% or more (or > or =25 mL/min per 1.73 m2) from baseline,
      ESRD, or death. Three primary treatment comparisons were specified: lower vs
      usual BP goal; ramipril vs metoprolol; and amlodipine vs metoprolol. RESULTS:
      Achieved BP averaged (SD) 128/78 (12/8) mm Hg in the lower BP group and 141/85
      (12/7) mm Hg in the usual BP group. The mean (SE) GFR slope from baseline through
      4 years did not differ significantly between the lower BP group (-2.21 [0.17]
      mL/min per 1.73 m2 per year) and the usual BP group (-1.95 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73
      m2 per year; P =.24), and the lower BP goal did not significantly reduce the rate
      of the clinical composite outcome (risk reduction for lower BP group = 2%; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], -22% to 21%; P =.85). None of the drug group
      comparisons showed consistent significant differences in the GFR slope. However, 
      compared with the metoprolol and amlodipine groups, the ramipril group manifested
      risk reductions in the clinical composite outcome of 22% (95% CI, 1%-38%; P =.04)
      and 38% (95% CI, 14%-56%; P =.004), respectively. There was no significant
      difference in the clinical composite outcome between the amlodipine and
      metoprolol groups. CONCLUSIONS: No additional benefit of slowing progression of
      hypertensive nephrosclerosis was observed with the lower BP goal.
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be more effective than
      beta-blockers or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in slowing GFR decline.

TI  - Relationship of antihypertensive treatment regimens and change in blood pressure 
      to risk for heart failure in hypertensive patients randomly assigned to doxazosin
      or chlorthalidone: further analyses from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering 
      treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial.
PG  - 313-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart
      Attack Trial reported that treatment initiated with doxazosin compared with
      chlorthalidone doubled the risk for heart failure in high-risk hypertensive
      patients (relative risk, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.79 to 2.32]). Patients assigned to
      doxazosin therapy had a mean in-trial systolic/diastolic blood pressure 3/0 mm Hg
      higher than that in patients assigned to chlorthalidone. Sixty-eight percent
      (6167 of 9061) of the former patients and 59% (9081 of 15 256) of the latter
      patients were given additional medications to achieve a target blood pressure of 
      less than 140/90 mm Hg. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the influence of open-label
      antihypertensive drugs and subsequent blood pressure on relative risk for heart
      failure. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial.
      SETTING: 623 sites in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Hypertensive
      patients 55 years of age or older with at least one additional risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease. INTERVENTION: Chlorthalidone (12.5 to 25 mg/d) or
      doxazosin (2 to 8 mg/d) for a planned follow-up of 4 to 8 years. MEASUREMENTS:
      Data on blood pressure, medication, and incident heart failure (treated outside
      hospital, hospitalized, or fatal) from February 1994 through December 1999.
      RESULTS: After the treatment groups were categorized as having no exposure to
      open-label medications (monotherapy) or exposure to open-label therapy, the
      relative risk for heart failure with doxazosin versus chlorthalidone was 3.10
      (CI, 2.51 to 3.82) and 1.42 (CI, 1.20 to 1.69), respectively. After adjustment
      for follow-up systolic/diastolic blood pressure, the overall relative risk was
      2.00 (CI, 1.72 to 2.32). CONCLUSION: In high-risk patients with hypertension, the
      higher risk for heart failure while taking doxazosin compared with chlorthalidone
      is attenuated but not eliminated by adding other antihypertensive drugs. The
      small observed difference in systolic blood pressure does not explain this
      increased risk.

TI  - Randomized comparison of T-type versus L-type calcium-channel blockade on
      exercise duration in stable angina: results of the Posicor Reduction of Ischemia 
      During Exercise (PRIDE) trial.
PG  - 60-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mibefradil is a T-type calcium-channel antagonist and arterial
      vasodilator with negative chronotropic effects. It is not known if T-type
      calcium-channel blockade is superior to L-type calcium-channel blockade in
      patients with stable angina pectoris. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind trial was conducted in patients with documented coronary disease and
      stable angina to compare a 360 mg dose of diltiazem CD with 100 mg dose of
      mibefradil. The primary end point was change in time to symptom-limited exercise 
      termination from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary efficacy parameters included time
      to onset of persistent ST-segment depression, time to awareness of angina, and
      change in exercise duration from baseline to 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS:
      A total of 121 patients were randomized to mibefradil and 113 to diltiazem CD. At
      8 weeks, the increase in exercise duration was 24.5 seconds greater in the
      mibefradil group (P =.017; 95% CI 4.4-44.7 seconds). At 8 weeks, time to
      development of > or =1 mm ST-segment depression was greater by 45.3 seconds (P
      =.0025; 95% CI 16.2-74.5) with mibefradil, but time to development of angina was 
      not significantly different. CONCLUSION: T-type calcium-channel antagonism with
      mibefradil improved treadmill exercise parameters compared with diltiazem in
      patients with chronic stable angina. Further investigation and development of
      antagonists of T-type calcium channels with fewer adverse drug interactions is
      warranted and may be promising in the management of ischemic heart disease.

TI  - The effects of calcium channel blockers on cardiovascular outcomes: a review of
      randomised controlled trials.
PG  - 71-8
AB  - The choice of antihypertensive treatment should be guided by evidence of a
      reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and therefore improved
      long-term outcome. Using pre-determined criteria, ten randomised, controlled
      trials that assessed the effects of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on CV events 
      in patients with hypertension were identified. Six of them enrolled a relatively 
      small number (< 1500) of hypertensive patients, whereas four of the studies were 
      much larger (> 4500 patients). The smaller studies produced mixed findings,
      especially those trials where CCBs were compared with diuretics; this may reflect
      methodological limitations and the impact of random error. The results from the
      four larger studies produced a consistent message: long-acting CCBs such as
      nifedipine, administered in a gastro-intestinal-transport-system (GITS)
      formulation, nitrendipine and diltiazem, reduce CV morbidity and mortality in
      hypertensive patients. In the one study that specifically enrolled high-risk
      hypertensive patients, nifedipine GITS was as effective as diuretic therapy in
      reducing CV events, and in all four larger studies sub-group analyses showed that
      the benefits of these CCBs extend to hypertensive patients with diabetes. The
      available evidence supports the use of these long-acting CCBs as a first-line
      treatment option in hypertensive patients.

TI  - Influence of age, sex and blood pressure on the principal endpoints of the Nordic
      Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study.
PG  - 1231-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study was to compare
      patients with essential hypertension receiving calcium-antagonist-based treatment
      with diltiazem and similar patients receiving conventional
      diuretic/beta-blocker-based treatment, with respect to cardiovascular morbidity
      and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of age, sex, severity of
      hypertension and heart rate on treatment effects, in a sub-analysis. METHODS: The
      NORDIL study was prospective, randomized, open and endpoint-blinded. It enrolled,
      at health centres in Norway and Sweden, 10 881 patients aged 50-74 years who had 
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 100 mmHg or more. Systolic blood pressure (SBP)
      and DBP were decreased by 20.3/18.7 mmHg in the diltiazem group and by 23.3/18.7 
      mmHg in the diuretic/beta-blocker group - a significant difference in SBP (P <
      0.001). RESULTS: The incidence of the primary endpoint - a composite of
      cardiovascular death, cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction - was similar for
      the two treatments. Fatal and non-fatal stroke occurred in 159 patients in the
      diltiazem group and in 196 patients in the conventional treatment group [relative
      risk (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; P = 0.040], whereas
      there was a non-significant inverse tendency with respect to all myocardial
      infarction. There were significantly fewer cerebral strokes in patients receiving
      diltiazem in the subgroups with baseline SBP > 170 mmHg (n = 5420, RR 0.75, 95%
      CI 0.58 to 0.98; P = 0.032), DBP >/= 105 mmHg (n = 5881, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 
      0.97; P = 0.030) and pulse pressure >/= 66 mmHg (n = 5461, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58
      to 0.99, P = 0.041), and more myocardial infarctions in those with heart rate
      less than 74 beats/min (n = 5303, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.87; P = 0.040).
      However, the tendencies for fewer strokes and greater incidence of myocardial
      infarction were present across subgroups when results were analysed for age, sex,
      severity of hypertension and heart rate, and treatment-subgroup interaction
      analyses were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a
      conventional diuretic/beta-blocker-based antihypertensive regimen, there were
      additional 25% reductions in stroke in the diltiazem-treated patients with blood 
      pressure or pulse pressure greater than the medians, and an increase in
      myocardial infarction in those with heart rate less than the median. Such
      findings may be attributable to chance, but the consistency of, in particular,
      the stroke findings may also suggest an ability of diltiazem, beyond conventional
      treatment, to prevent cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients with the greatest 
      cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Effect of verapamil in elderly patients with left ventricular diastolic
      dysfunction as a cause of congestive heart failure.
PG  - 57-62
AB  - Fifteen elderly patients with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function and 
      New York Heart Association functional class II-III were studied. The effect of
      verapamil on LV diastolic function was assessed by congestive heart failure (CHF)
      score, treadmill exercise test, and Doppler echocardiography at baseline, and
      after each three-month treatment period (placebo or verapamil 120 mg once daily),
      separated by a one-week washout period before crossover. Blood pressure, heart
      rate, LV ejection fraction, LV mass, and cardiac output were unaltered by placebo
      or verapamil. Verapamil treatment significantly improved CHF score at 3 months
      (3.5 +/- 0.5, p<0.05) compared with baseline (5.6 +/- 0.5) or placebo (5.5 +/-
      0.5). The exercise time was similar at baseline (7.4 +/- 1.2 min) and after
      placebo (7.4 +/- 1.3 min) treatment but significantly (p<0.05) increased after
      verapamil (8.3 +/- 1.2 min) treatment. The ratio of mitral A wave
      duration/pulmonary venous atrial systolic reversal duration increased after
      verapamil (1.11 +/- 0.08) treatment compared with placebo (0.91 +/- 0.07, p<0.05)
      and baseline (0.89 +/- 0.08) which had similar durations. The isovolumic
      relaxation time was significantly (p<0.05) decreased from 84 +/- 12 ms at
      baseline and 86 +/- 13 ms with placebo to 73 +/- 9 ms with verapamil. The results
      of this study suggest that in elderly patients with Doppler evidence of diastolic
      dysfunction as the cause of CHF, three months treatment with verapamil can
      improve CHF, increase exercise tolerance and improve LV diastolic function.

TI  - Evidence-based evaluation of calcium channel blockers for hypertension: equality 
      of mortality and cardiovascular risk relative to conventional therapy.
PG  - 315-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES; We present a meta-analysis based on three recent, substantial,
      randomized outcome trials and several smaller trials that compared calcium
      channel blockers (CCBs) with conventional therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers) or
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. BACKGROUND: There is
      continuing uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of CCBs in the treatment of 
      hypertension. Previous meta-analyses conflict and suggest that CCBs increase
      myocardial infarction (MI) or protect from stroke. METHODS: Standard procedures
      for meta-analysis were used to analyze three major trials on 21,611 patients and 
      another three lesser studies to a total of 24,322 patients. RESULTS: Calcium
      channel blockers have a strikingly similar risk of total and cardiovascular
      mortality and of major cardiovascular events to conventional therapy. Calcium
      channel blockers give a lower risk of nonfatal stroke (-25%, p = 0.001) and a
      higher risk of total MI (18%, p = 0.013), chiefly nonfatal (18%). After
      performing the Bonferroni correction for multiplicity, these p values become
      0.004 and 0.052, respectively. When compared with ACE inhibitors in 1,318
      diabetic patients, CCBs had a substantially higher risk of nonfatal (relative
      risk [RR] = 2.259) and total MI (RR = 2.204, confidence interval 1.501 to 3.238; 
      p = 0.001 or 0.004 with Bonferroni correction). Total and cardiovascular
      mortality rates are similar. To confirm the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors are
      superior to CCBs in diabetic patients requires more trial data, especially with
      renal end points. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality (total and cardiovascular) and major
      cardiovascular events with CCBs were apparently similar to those events seen with
      conventional first-line therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers). Stroke reduction
      more than balanced increased MI. In diabetics, CCBs may be less safe than ACE
      inhibitors.

TI  - A double-blind, parallel-group study of amlodipine versus long-acting nitrate in 
      the management of elderly patients with stable angina.
PG  - 72-7
AB  - Ninety-seven elderly patients with stable angina were included in a 28-week,
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of amlodipine 5-10 mg and
      isosorbide mononitrate 25-50 mg once daily. The total exercise time, as limited
      by angina, was recorded together with the median incidence per week of angina
      attacks and glyceryl trinitrate consumption. Safety was assessed by adverse event
      frequency, measurement of vital signs and laboratory parameters, and quality of
      life. At the final visit, the total exercise time was significantly greater
      relative to baseline with amlodipine than isosorbide mononitrate (final/baseline 
      difference: 112.2 vs. 32.2, p = 0.016). There were no statistically significant
      differences between the groups in relation to the incidence of adverse events.
      Once daily amlodipine provides significantly better control of stable angina than
      isosorbide mononitrate in this elderly population.

TI  - One-year study of felodipine or placebo for stage 1 isolated systolic
      hypertension.
PG  - 1118-23
AB  - Asubstantial number of older hypertensive patients have stage 1 isolated systolic
      hypertension (systolic blood pressure between 140 and 159 mm Hg and diastolic
      blood pressure <90 mm Hg), but there are currently no data showing that drug
      treatment is effective, safe, and/or beneficial. To compare the effects of active
      treatment compared with placebo on blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, 
      and quality of life among older stage 1 isolated systolic hypertensive patients, 
      a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial comparing 
      felodipine (2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily) and matching placebo was performed in
      171 patients (49% male, average age 66+/-7 years, with 49% white and 30%
      Hispanic) with a baseline blood pressure of 149+/-7/83+/-6 mm Hg. During 52 weeks
      of treatment, patients randomized to active treatment achieved significantly
      lower blood pressures (137.0+/-11.7/80.2+/-7.6 mm Hg for extended-release
      felodipine versus 147.5+/-16.0/83.5+/-9.7 mm Hg for placebo, P<0.01 for each), a 
      reduced incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (7% for extended release
      felodipine versus 24% for placebo, P<0.04), and improved quality of life (change 
      in Psychological General Well-Being index, 3.0+/-6.8 for extended-release
      felodipine versus -0.8+/-10.3 for placebo, P<0.01) versus baseline. There were no
      clinically significant differences between treatments in tolerability or adverse 
      effects. Stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension can be effectively and safely
      treated pharmacologically. Treatment reduced progression to the higher stages of 
      hypertension, reduced the incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and improved
      an overall measure of the quality of life. Larger and longer studies will be
      needed to document any long-term reduction in cardiovascular event rates
      associated with treating stage 1 systolic hypertension.

TI  - Efficacy, tolerability and influence on "quality of life" of nifedipine GITS
      versus amlodipine in elderly patients with mild-moderate hypertension.
PG  - 176-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study was to compare efficacy, tolerability
      and influence on quality of life (QOL) of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic
      system (NI) 30-60 mg once a day vs amlodipine (AM) 5-10 mg once a day in elderly 
      patients with mild-moderate hypertension. DESIGN: This was a randomized,
      double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study. After a 2-week single-blind
      placebo run-in, patients were randomized to either NI 30 mg or AM 5 mg.
      Responders continued on the same dosage for 16 additional weeks, while
      non-responders were titrated to 60 mg NI or 10 mg AM. METHODS: Blood pressure was
      measured by mercury sphygmomanometer and efficacy equivalence of NI and AM tested
      by covariance analysis. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the primary efficacy
      parameter, its baseline value being taken as covariate while centers effect and
      treatment interaction were included as fixed effects in the analysis model. The
      secondary efficacy variables systolic blood pressure (SBP) and scores for QOL
      were analyzed according to the same model. RESULTS: At the end of the study,
      overall mean DBPs, calculated as least-square means (LSMEANS), in the "by
      protocol" population were 87.5 mmHg for NI and 86.7 for AM (difference 0.8 mmHg
      with 90% CI -1.2 to 2.8 mmHg). In the "by intention to treat" (ITT) population
      LSMEANS were 87.6 mmHg for NI and 86.4 mmHg for AM (difference 1.2 mmHg with 90% 
      CI -0.6 to 3.1 mmHg). SBP LSMEANS in the "by protocol" population were 147.7 mmHg
      for NI and 147.3 mmHg for AM (difference 0.3 mmHg, with 90% CI -3.7 to 4.3);
      corresponding values in the "by ITT" population were 148.0 mmHg for NI and 147.2 
      for AM (difference 0.8 mmHg, with 90% CI -2.8 to 4.6). Mean values for QOL
      parameters were not significantly different. A total of 173 episodes of adverse
      events were documented in 54 patients (26 NI and 28 AM), dropouts were 15 (20% of
      group) on NI and 21 (28%) on AM. CONCLUSIONS: NI 30-60 mg was shown to be as
      efficacious and safe as AM 5-10 mg in elderly patients with mild-moderate
      hypertension. QOL improved compared to baseline with no significant difference
      between the two drugs, thus confirming a positive class effect for calcium
      antagonists.

TI  - A random comparison of fosinopril and nifedipine GITS in patients with primary
      renal disease.
PG  - 1871-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate in a random comparison the capacity of an angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor (fosinopril), and that of a long-acting
      dihydropiridine (nifedipine GITS) to modify the decay in renal function in
      patients with primary renal disease, exhibiting a progressive increase in serum
      creatinine during the previous 2 years. METHODS: A randomized, open-label,
      multicenter study with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. A total of 241 patients
      were included in the study. All of them were hypertensive and had a 25% or at
      least 0.5 mg/dl increase in the value of serum creatinine during the 24 months
      prior to entering the study. Initial doses of fosinopril and nifedipine GITS were
      10 and 30 mg respectively, and titration to 30 and 60 mg was performed if needed 
      to obtain the expected blood pressure goal (< 140/90 mmHg). Furosemide, atenolol,
      and doxazosin were added as second, third, and fourth drugs if necessary, for
      blood pressure control. The primary end-point of the study was the appearance of 
      double the serum creatinine values and/or the need to enter a dialysis programme.
      Secondary end-points were cardiovascular events, death, changes in 24 h
      proteinuria, and the evolution of serum creatinine. Data reflect the analysis
      performed by intention to treat. RESULTS: Mean age of the group was 54 +/- 14,
      and 59% were males. Primary glomerulonephritis (31%), nephrosclerosis (26%) and
      polycystic kidney disease (19%) were the three most frequent diagnostic findings.
      After 3 years of follow-up, 21% (27/127) of patients treated with fosinopril, and
      36% (40/112) of those receiving nifedipine GITS presented a primary end-point,
      (OR 0.47, 95% confidence intervals 0.26-0.84, P = 0.01). Renal survival was
      significantly better when fosinopril constituted the first step therapy (P =
      0.002). These results did not seem to be influenced by the type of primary renal 
      disease. Proteinuria decreased at the end of the study by a mean of 57% in the
      fosinopril group and increased by 7% in the group receiving dihydropiridine.
      Blood pressure control did not differ among groups for diastolic values. During
      follow-up, however, the patients receiving ACEi showed systolic blood pressure
      values 4-6 mmHg lower. CONCLUSION: In patients with chronic renal failure and
      hypertension due to primary renal disease, fosinopril significantly differed from
      nifedipine GITS by its capacity to slow the progressive decay in renal function. 
      The drugs also differed by their capacity to lower blood pressure. The better
      control, in particular of systolic blood pressure, in the fosinopril arm could
      have contributed in a relevant manner to the attainment of a better outcome when 
      the ACEi was employed.

TI  - Efficacy, tolerability, and impact on quality of life of long-term treatment with
      manidipine or amlodipine in patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 642-50
AB  - This double-blind, multicenter trial compared antihypertensive efficacy,
      tolerability, and impact on quality of life of manidipine and amlodipine in
      patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Patients were randomly
      assigned to 48 weeks of once-daily manidipine, 10-20 mg, or amlodipine, 5-10 mg. 
      Patients who did not respond to treatment after 12 weeks were also given
      enalapril, 10-20 mg, for the study's duration. The main efficacy end point was
      equivalence in sitting systolic (SiSBP) and diastolic (SiDBP) blood pressure
      reduction between the two drugs after 8 weeks (per protocol analysis). An
      intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed in all patients with at least one
      efficacy determination during treatment. Quality of life was assessed by the
      "Subjective Symptoms Assessment Profile" (SSA-P) and "General Well-being
      Schedule" (GWBS), after 12 weeks of treatment. SiSBP reduction after 8 weeks was 
      equivalent for manidipine (15.2 mm Hg, n = 227) and amlodipine (17.0 mm Hg, n =
      219). The corresponding figure for SiDBP was 11.3 mm Hg for manidipine and 12.3
      mm Hg for amlodipine. In the larger ITT population SiDBP was similarly and
      significantly reduced by manidipine (from 102 +/- 5 to 88 +/- 9 mm Hg, n = 241)
      and amlodipine (from 101 +/- 5 to 87 +/- 8 mm Hg, n = 240). Similar results were 
      observed for SiSBP and standing SBP and DBP. Neither drug changed sitting or
      standing heart rate compared with baseline. SSA-P scores improved with manidipine
      but not amlodipine. GWBS total and partial scores increased more with manidipine 
      than with amlodipine. Safety profile favored manidipine, which was associated
      with significantly less ankle edema than was amlodipine. This study shows for the
      first time that long-term treatment with the long-acting calcium channel blocker 
      manidipine is as effective as treatment with amlodipine, has a better
      tolerability profile, and induces greater improvement in quality of life than
      amlodipine.

TI  - VERDICT: the Verapamil versus Digoxin Cardioversion Trial: A randomized study on 
      the role of calcium lowering for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion 
      of persistent atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 766-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many relapses of atrial fibrillation (AF) occur, especially during 
      the first week(s) after electrical cardioversion (ECV). The aim of the present
      study was to compare in a randomized design the efficacy of verapamil
      (intracellular calcium lowering) versus digoxin (calcium increasing) for
      maintenance of sinus rhythm after ECV. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients
      with persistent AF were randomized to verapamil (n = 49) or digoxin (n = 48) for 
      1 month before and 1 month after ECV. The first month after ECV, patients
      recorded heart rhythm using daily transtelephonic monitoring. No additional
      antiarrhythmic drugs were given. Of the 97 patients, 43 patients (20 verapamil)
      underwent ECV per protocol. Median previous AF duration was 18 and 26 days for
      verapamil and digoxin, respectively. There were no differences in atrial
      dimensions and underlying heart disease between the two groups. The success rate 
      of ECV was 75% versus 83% (P = NS). After 1 month, 47% versus 53% (P = NS) had
      recurrence of AF. Median time to recurrence was 5 days (range 0 to 26) versus 8
      days (range 2 to 28) (P = NS), respectively. CONCLUSION: Stand-alone
      intracellular calcium lowering by verapamil around ECV does not enhance
      cardioversion outcome.

TI  - Characteristics of 15,314 hypertensive patients at high coronary risk. The VALUE 
      trial. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation.
PG  - 83-91
AB  - Valsartan is an orally active, selective antagonist of the angiotensin II-1 (AT1)
      receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Valsartan
      Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) Trial of Cardiovascular Events 
      in Hypertension is a double-blind, randomized prospective, parallel group study
      designed to compare the effects of valsartan with those of the calcium-antagonist
      amlodipine on the reduction of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with
      essential hypertension, aged 50 years and older, and at particularly high risk of
      coronary events were enrolled. 18,119 patients were screened and 15,314 patients 
      in 31 countries were randomized mainly between January 1998 and December 1999.
      These hypertensives had a mean blood pressure of 154.7/87.5 mmHg at the time of
      their randomization to blinded medication. The population comprises both genders 
      (men 57.6%), Caucasians (89.1%), mean age 67.2 years, mean body mass index 28.6
      kg/m2, coronary heart disease (45.8%), high cholesterol (33.0%), type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (31.7%) and smokers (24.0%). More than 92% of the randomized
      participants had been treated for high blood pressure for at least 6 months when 
      screened for the study. The randomized population is now being treated (goal
      blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg) in adherence with the protocol until at least 1450 
      patients experience primary cardiac endpoint defined as clinically evident or
      aborted myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or death caused 
      by coronary heart disease.

TI  - Effect of verapamil on prevention of atrial fibrillation in patients implanted
      with an implantable atrial defibrillator.
PG  - 503-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of verapamil in the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF)
      in patients with recurrent AF is unknown. HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was
      to evaluate the effect of verapamil on the prevention of AF in patients implanted
      with an implantable atrial defibrillator (IAD). METHODS: The effects of verapamil
      (240 mg/day) on the total duration of AF, number of AF recurrences, and number of
      cardioversions were prospectively evaluated in a randomized, crossover fashion
      over an 8-week period in 11 patients (9 men, 2 women; mean age: 60 +/- 6 years)
      implanted with an IAD. RESULTS: Implantable atrial defibrillators successfully
      converted 13 of 14 (93%) spontaneous episodes of AF. There was no significant
      difference in the efficacy of cardioversion (86 vs. 100%, p = 0.8), the total
      duration of AF (173 +/- 198 vs. 270 +/- 241 h, p = 0.5), the number of AF
      episodes (8.5 +/- 9.0 vs. 9.3 +/- 10.2, p = 0.3), and the number of
      cardioversions (1.7 +/- 2.4 vs. 1.8 +/- 2.1 p = 0.7) with or without treatment
      with verapamil. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that
      treatment with verapamil has no significant effect on the prevention of AF in
      patients treated with an LAD.

TI  - Effect of ramipril vs amlodipine on renal outcomes in hypertensive
      nephrosclerosis: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2719-28
AB  - CONTEXT: Incidence of end-stage renal disease due to hypertension has increased
      in recent decades, but the optimal strategy for treatment of hypertension to
      prevent renal failure is unknown, especially among African Americans. OBJECTIVE: 
      To compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
      (ramipril), a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), and a
      beta-blocker (metoprolol) on hypertensive renal disease progression. DESIGN,
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Interim analysis of a randomized, double-blind, 3 x 2 
      factorial trial conducted in 1094 African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with
      hypertensive renal disease (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 20-65 mL/min per 
      1.73 m(2)) enrolled between February 1995 and September 1998. This report
      compares the ramipril and amlodipine groups following discontinuation of the
      amlodipine intervention in September 2000. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were
      randomly assigned to receive amlodipine, 5 to 10 mg/d (n = 217), ramipril, 2.5 to
      10 mg/d (n = 436), or metoprolol, 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 441), with other agents
      added to achieve 1 of 2 blood pressure goals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome measure was the rate of change in GFR; the main secondary outcome was a
      composite index of the clinical end points of reduction in GFR of more than 50%
      or 25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), end-stage renal disease, or death. RESULTS: Among
      participants with a urinary protein to creatinine ratio of >0.22 (corresponding
      approximately to proteinuria of more than 300 mg/d), the ramipril group had a 36%
      (2.02 [SE, 0.74] mL/min per 1.73 m(2)/y) slower mean decline in GFR over 3 years 
      (P =.006) and a 48% reduced risk of the clinical end points vs the amlodipine
      group (95% confidence interval [CI], 20%-66%). In the entire cohort, there was no
      significant difference in mean GFR decline from baseline to 3 years between
      treatment groups (P =.38). However, compared with the amlodipine group, after
      adjustment for baseline covariates the ramipril group had a 38% reduced risk of
      clinical end points (95% CI, 13%-56%), a 36% slower mean decline in GFR after 3
      months (P =.002), and less proteinuria (P<.001). CONCLUSION: Ramipril, compared
      with amlodipine, retards renal disease progression in patients with hypertensive 
      renal disease and proteinuria and may offer benefit to patients without
      proteinuria.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the primary hypothesis that a newer antihypertensive treatment
      regimen (calcium channel blocker +/- an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) 
      is more effective than an older regimen (beta-blocker +/- a diuretic) in the
      primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). To test a second primary
      hypothesis that a statin compared with placebo will further protect against CHD
      endpoints in hypertensive subjects with a total cholesterol < or = 6.5 mmol/l.
      DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint trial with a
      double-blinded 2 x 2 factorial component. SETTING: Patients were recruited mainly
      from general practices. PATIENTS: Men and women aged 40-79 were eligible if their
      blood pressure was > or = 160 mmHg systolic or > or = 100 mmHg diastolic
      (untreated) or > or = 140 mmHg systolic or > or = 90 mmHg diastolic (treated) at 
      randomization. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either amlodipine (5/ 10 mg) +/- 
      perindopril (4/8 mg) or atenolol (50/ 100 mg) +/- bendroflumethiazide (1.25/2.5
      mg) +K+ with further therapy as required to reach a blood pressure of < or = 140 
      mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic. Patients with a total cholesterol of < or = 
      6.5 mmol/l were further randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg or
      placebo daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and
      fatal coronary heart disease (CHD). RESULTS: 19 342 men and women were initially 
      randomized, of these 10297 were also randomized into the lipid-lowering limb. All
      patients had three or more additional cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS:
      The study has 80% power (at the 5% level) to detect a relative difference of 20% 
      in CHD endpoints between the calcium channel blocker-based regimen and the
      beta-blocker-based regimen. The lipid-lowering limb of the study has 90% power at
      the 1% level to detect a relative difference of 30% in CHD endpoints between
      groups.

AB  - AIMS: Treatment of hypertension in patients with chronic renal failure has been
      shown to postpone the decline in renal function. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor 
      has been shown to be superior to conventional antihypertensive treatment, but it 
      is not known how an ACE inhibitor compares to treatment with a calcium channel
      blocker or to treatment with a combination of these drugs. The aim of the study
      was to evaluate the rate of decline in GFR in patients with chronic renal failure
      and hypertension treated with isradipine and spirapril as monotherapy and in
      combination. METHODS: Sixty patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension 
      were enrolled in the study. After enrollment, patients were followed
      prospectively for 6 months in the outpatient clinic on their usual
      antihypertensive medication, and then randomized to a double-blinded comparison
      of either spirapril 6 mg daily, isradipine 5 mg daily or spirapril 3 mg and
      isradipine 2.5 mg daily. After randomization, patients were followed for 21
      months or until the need for dialysis. Every 3 months before and 3.5 months after
      randomization the glomerular filtration rate was measured by 51Cr-EDTA clearance 
      and the effective renal plasma flow evaluated using the renal clearance of
      paraaminohippuric acid. RESULTS: Blood pressure and the decline in glomerular
      filtration rate did not differ between the groups before randomization. After
      randomization, the mean decline in the glomerular filtration rate was -0.32
      ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the spirapril group, -0.58 ml/(min x month x 1.73
      m2) in the isradipine group and -0.14 ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the
      combination group (p = 0.38). Twelve patients, 4 in each group, reached end-stage
      renal failure. No significant difference was found with respect to diastolic (p =
      0.10) or systolic blood pressure (p = 0.08) during the treatment period, but a
      trend towards a better blood pressure control in the combination group was
      present. During treatment, the rate of decline in renal plasma flow did not
      differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.09), neither did the changes in
      filtration fraction (FF) (p = 0.58) nor the mean FF (p = 0.22) during the
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated differences between the 3 treatment
      modalities in favor of combined therapy with respect to both the rate of decline 
      in GFR and blood pressure control, but the differences where insignificant. Thus,
      the treatments might differ, but we were unable to confirm this because of large 
      variation in GFR and small sample size.

TI  - The risk of limb deficiencies and other congenital abnormalities in children
      exposed in utero to calcium channel blockers.
PG  - 397-401
AB  - AIM: Calcium channel blockers given to pregnant rats have shown an increased
      prevalence of digital and limb defects and their safety in pregnant women has
      thus been questioned. We examined the risk of malformations following exposure in
      utero to calcium channel blockers. METHOD: We conducted a nationwide case-control
      study based on the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital
      Abnormalities and identified 22,865 cases with congenital abnormalities and
      31,151 population controls during the period 1980-1996. Data on drug exposure
      were obtained from official questionnaires and obligatory prenatal care logbooks.
      RESULTS: Among the cases, 586 mothers (2.6%) had been exposed to calcium channel 
      blockers during pregnancy compared with 907 controls (2.4%). The overall
      prevalence ratios for 17 congenital abnormalities varied between 1.1 and 1.4, and
      there was no significant increased risk of limb deficiencies or other congenital 
      abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Our data did not indicate an increased prevalence of
      congenital abnormalities in offspring exposed to calcium channel blockers in
      utero.

TI  - Amlodipine versus slow release metoprolol in the treatment of stable exertional
      angina pectoris (AMSA).
PG  - 475-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of amlodipine and slow release metoprolol on
      subjective symptoms and signs of ischaemia during bicycle ergometric exercise
      tests in patients with stable angina pectoris. DESIGN: A randomized double-blind 
      comparison of the two drugs in patients with documented coronary disease required
      to have at least three attacks of angina per week and to perform a
      symptom-limited exercise test with significant signs of ischaemia in the ECG.
      RESULTS: Out of 127 patients, 117 completed the study. Both amlodipine and
      metoprolol significantly increased total exercise time, total workload, time to
      onset of angina and time to 1 mm ST-depression with no significant differences
      between the drugs. Amlodipine was significantly more efficient than metoprolol in
      reducing ST-depression at maximum workload. Diary data revealed no differences in
      patients' self-rating of drug effects. CONCLUSIONS: Judged by suppression of
      subjective symptoms and performance on exercise tolerance tests amlodipine
      represents a useful alternative to metoprolol as monotherapy in stable angina
      pectoris.

TI  - Effects of ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and other blood-pressure-lowering
      drugs: results of prospectively designed overviews of randomised trials. Blood
      Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration.
PG  - 1955-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: This programme of overviews of randomised trials was established to
      investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
      calcium antagonists, and other blood-pressure-lowering drugs on mortality and
      major cardiovascular morbidity in several populations of patients. We did
      separate overviews of trials comparing active treatment regimens with placebo,
      trials comparing more intensive and less intensive blood-pressure-lowering
      strategies, and trials comparing treatment regimens based on different drug
      classes. METHODS: The hypotheses to be investigated, the trials to be included,
      and the outcomes to be studied were all selected before the results of any
      participating trial were known. Individual participant data or group tabular data
      were provided by each trial and combined by standard statistical techniques.
      FINDINGS: The overview of placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors (four
      trials, 12,124 patients mostly with coronary heart disease) revealed reductions
      in stroke (30% [95% CI 15-43]), coronary heart disease (20% [11-28]), and major
      cardiovascular events (21% [14-27]). The overview of placebo-controlled trials of
      calcium antagonists (two trials, 5520 patients mostly with hypertension) showed
      reductions in stroke (39% [15-56]) and major cardiovascular events (28% [13-41]).
      In the overview of trials comparing blood-pressure-lowering strategies of
      different intensity (three trials, 20,408 patients with hypertension), there were
      reduced risks of stroke (20% [2-35]), coronary heart disease (19% [2-33]), and
      major cardiovascular events (15% [4-24]) with more intensive therapy. In the
      overviews comparing different antihypertensive regimens (eight trials, 37,872
      patients with hypertension), several differences in cause-specific effects were
      seen between calcium-antagonist-based therapy and other regimens, but each was of
      borderline significance. INTERPRETATION: Strong evidence of benefits of ACE
      inhibitors and calcium antagonists is provided by the overviews of
      placebo-controlled trials. There is weaker evidence of differences between
      treatment regimens of differing intensities and of differences between treatment 
      regimens based on different drug classes. Data from continuing trials of
      blood-pressure-lowering drugs will substantially increase the evidence available 
      about any real differences that might exist between regimens.

TI  - Health outcomes associated with calcium antagonists compared with other
      first-line antihypertensive therapies: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled
      trials.
PG  - 1949-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several observational studies and individual randomised trials in
      hypertension have suggested that, compared with other drugs, calcium antagonists 
      may be associated with a higher risk of coronary events, despite similar
      blood-pressure control. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects 
      of calcium antagonists and other antihypertensive drugs on major cardiovascular
      events. METHODS: We undertook a meta-analysis of trials in hypertension that
      assessed cardiovascular events and included at least 100 patients, who were
      randomly assigned intermediate-acting or long-acting calcium antagonists or other
      antihypertensive drugs and who were followed up for at least 2 years. FINDINGS:
      The nine eligible trials included 27,743 participants. Calcium antagonists and
      other drugs achieved similar control of both systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure. Compared with patients assigned diuretics, beta-blockers,
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, or clonidine (n=15,044), those assigned
      calcium antagonists (n=12,699) had a significantly higher risk of acute
      myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.43], p=0.0003), congestive 
      heart failure (1.25 [1.07-1.46], p=0.005), and major cardiovascular events (1.10 
      [1.02-1.18], p=0.018). The treatment differences were within the play of chance
      for the outcomes of stroke (0.90 [0.80-1.02], p=0.10) and all-cause mortality
      (1.03 [0.94-1.13], p=0.54). INTERPRETATION: In randomised controlled trials, the 
      large available database suggests that calcium antagonists are inferior to other 
      types of antihypertensive drugs as first-line agents in reducing the risks of
      several major complications of hypertension. On the basis of these data, the
      longer-acting calcium antagonists cannot be recommended as first-line therapy for
      hypertension.

TI  - Rhythm or rate control in atrial fibrillation--Pharmacological Intervention in
      Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF): a randomised trial.
PG  - 1789-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained
      cardiac arrhythmia. Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm is believed by
      many physicians to be superior to rate control only. However, there are no
      prospective data that compare both therapeutic strategies. METHODS: The
      Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF) trial was a randomised
      trial in 252 patients with atrial fibrillation of between 7 days and 360 days
      duration, which compared rate (group A, 125 patients) with rhythm control (group 
      B, 127 patients). In group A, diltiazem was used as first-line therapy and
      amiodarone was used in group B. The primary study endpoint was improvement in
      symptoms related to atrial fibrillation. FINDINGS: Over the entire observation
      period of 1 year, a similar proportion of patients reported improvement in
      symptoms in both groups (76 responders at 12 months in group A vs 70 responders
      in group B, p=0.317). Amiodarone administration resulted in pharmacological
      restoration of sinus rhythm in 23% of patients. Walking distance in a 6 min walk 
      test was better in group B compared with group A, but assessment of quality of
      life showed no differences between groups. The incidence of hospital admission
      was higher in group B (87 [69%] out of 127 vs 30 [24%] out of 125 in group A,
      p=0.001). Adverse drug effects more frequently led to a change in therapy in
      group B (31 [25%] patients compared with 17 [14%] in group A, p=0.036).
      INTERPRETATION: With respect to symptomatic improvement in patients with atrial
      fibrillation, the therapeutic strategies of rate versus rhythm control yielded
      similar clinical results overall. However, exercise tolerance is better with
      rhythm control, although hospital admission is more frequent. These data may
      serve as a basis to select therapy in individual patients.

TI  - Monotherapy with amlodipine or atenolol versus their combination in stable angina
      pectoris.
PG  - 763-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: The basic cause of angina pectoris is imbalance between the metabolic
      needs of the myocardium and the capacity of the coronary circulation to deliver
      sufficient oxygenated blood to satisfy these needs. HYPOTHESIS: The study was
      undertaken to evaluate whether the effect of combined amlodipine and atenolol
      therapy on patients with stable angina pectoris and with ST-depression during
      exercise testing and 48-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is superior 
      to that of either agent given alone. METHODS: Patients with stable angina
      pectoris and ST depression during exercise and ambulatory monitoring were
      randomized to receive amlodipine (n = 116) or atenolol (n = 116), or both (n =
      119). All patients were also treated with short- and long-acting nitrates. The
      design was a double-blind, randomized, triple-arm parallel group study with 10
      weeks of administration of the test medication. RESULTS: In terms of time to
      onset of ST depression > 1 mm, time to onset of angina, total exercise time,
      maximum achieved workload, and peak intensity of angina, amlodipine and atenolol 
      alone were as effective as their combination. During ambulatory monitoring,
      atenolol was more effective than amlodipine regarding total time and number of
      ST-depression episodes, and as effective as the combined drugs. CONCLUSION: For
      individual patients with stable angina pectoris, combination of a beta blocker
      with a calcium antagonist is not necessarily more effective than either drug
      given alone.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine on the progression of atherosclerosis and the occurrence of 
      clinical events. PREVENT Investigators.
PG  - 1503-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: The results of angiographic studies have suggested that calcium
      channel-blocking agents may prevent new coronary lesion formation, the
      progression of minimal lesions, or both. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Prospective
      Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT) was a
      multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial
      designed to test whether amlodipine would slow the progression of early coronary 
      atherosclerosis in 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery 
      disease. The primary outcome was the average 36-month angiographic change in mean
      minimal diameters of segments with a baseline diameter stenosis of 30%. A
      secondary hypothesis was whether amlodipine would reduce the rate of
      atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries as assessed with B-mode ultrasonography, 
      which measured intimal-medial thicknesses (IMT). The rates of clinical events
      were also monitored. The placebo and amlodipine groups had nearly identical
      average 36-month reductions in the minimal diameter: 0.084 versus 0.095 mm,
      respectively (P:=0.38). In contrast, amlodipine had a significant effect in
      slowing the 36-month progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis: the placebo
      group experienced a 0.033-mm increase in IMT, whereas there was a 0. 0126-mm
      decrease in the amlodipine group (P:=0.007). There was no treatment difference in
      the rates of all-cause mortality or major cardiovascular events, although
      amlodipine use was associated with fewer cases of unstable angina and coronary
      revascularization. CONCLUSIONS: Amlodipine has no demonstrable effect on
      angiographic progression of coronary atherosclerosis or the risk of major
      cardiovascular events but is associated with fewer hospitalizations for unstable 
      angina and revascularization.

TI  - Morbidity and mortality in patients randomised to double-blind treatment with a
      long-acting calcium-channel blocker or diuretic in the International Nifedipine
      GITS study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT).
PG  - 366-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of antihypertensive drugs newer than diuretics and
      beta-blockers has not been established. We compared the effects of the
      calcium-channel blocker nifedipine once daily with the diuretic combination
      co-amilozide on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in high-risk patients with
      hypertension. METHODS: We did a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial in
      Europe and Israel in 6321 patients aged 55-80 years with hypertension (blood
      pressure > or = 150/95 mm Hg, or > or = 160 mm Hg systolic). Patients had at
      least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. We randomly assigned patients
      nifedipine 30 mg in a long-acting gastrointestinal-transport-system (GITS)
      formulation (n=3157), or co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg [corrected] plus
      amiloride 2.5 mg; n=3164). Dose titration was by dose doubling, and addition of
      atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg. The primary outcome was cardiovascular
      death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke. Analysis was done by
      intention to treat. FINDINGS: Primary outcomes occurred in 200 (6.3%) patients in
      the nifedipine group and in 182 (5.8%) in the co-amilozide group (18.2 vs 16.5
      events per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.10 [95% CI 0.91-1.34], p=0.35).
      Overall mean blood pressure fell from 173/99 mm Hg (SD 14/8) to 138/82 mm Hg
      (12/7). There was an 8% excess of withdrawals from the nifedipine group because
      of peripheral oedema (725 vs 518, p<0.0001), but serious adverse events were more
      frequent in the co-amilozide group (880 vs 796, p=0.02). Deaths were mainly
      non-vascular (nifedipine 176 vs co-amilozide 172; p=0.81). 80% of the primary
      events occurred in patients receiving randomised treatment (157 nifedipine, 147
      co-amilozide, difference 0.33% [-0.7 to 1.4]). INTERPRETATION: Nifedipine once
      daily and co-amilozide were equally effective in preventing overall
      cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications. The choice of drug can be
      decided by tolerability and blood-pressure response rather than long-term safety 
      or efficacy.

TI  - Randomised trial of effects of calcium antagonists compared with diuretics and
      beta-blockers on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertension: the
      Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) study.
PG  - 359-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium antagonists are a first-line treatment for hypertension. The 
      effectiveness of diltiazem, a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, in reducing
      cardiovascular morbidity or mortality is unclear. We compared the effects of
      diltiazem with that of diuretics, beta-blockers, or both on cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. METHODS: In a prospective,
      randomised, open, blinded endpoint study, we enrolled 10,881 patients, aged 50-74
      years, at health centres in Norway and Sweden, who had diastolic blood pressure
      of 100 mm Hg or more. We randomly assigned patients diltiazem, or diuretics,
      beta-blockers, or both. The combined primary endpoint was fatal and non-fatal
      stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death. Analysis was done 
      by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were
      lowered effectively in the diltiazem and diuretic and beta-blocker groups
      (reduction 20.3/18.7 vs 23.3/18.7 mm Hg; difference in systolic reduction
      p<0.001). A primary endpoint occurred in 403 patients in the diltiazem group and 
      in 400 in the diuretic and beta-blocker group (16.6 vs 16.2 events per 1000
      patient-years; relative risk 1.00 [95% CI 0.87-1.15], p=0.97). Fatal and
      non-fatal stroke occurred in 159 patients in the diltiazem group and in 196 in
      the diuretic and beta-blocker group (6.4 vs 7.9 events per 1000 patient-years;
      0.80 [0.65-0.99], p=0.04) and fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction in 183
      and 157 patients (7.4 vs 6.3 events per 1000 patient-years; 1.16 [0.94-1.44],
      p=0.17). INTERPRETATION: Diltiazem was as effective as treatment based on
      diuretics, beta-blockers, or both in preventing the combined primary endpoint of 
      all stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death.

TI  - Plasma norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide in heart failure: influence 
      of felodipine in the third Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial. V-HeFT III
      investigators.
PG  - 97-107
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system by short-acting
      dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists has been reported to harm
      hypertensive patients. Different neurohormonal profiles and their response to
      treatment may influence the effectiveness of dihydropyridine vasodilator
      treatment of heart failure. METHODS: Four hundred fifty men with left ventricular
      (LV) systolic dysfunction were administered standard heart failure treatment and 
      felodipine extended release (ER) or placebo in the Vasodilator Heart Failure
      Trial III (V-HeFT III). Plasma norepinephrine (PNE) levels, atrial natriuretic
      peptide (ANP) levels, exercise capacity, LV ejection fraction (EF), cardiac
      dimensions and function, and arrhythmia frequency were measured. Hospital-free
      survival for baseline neurohormonal classes was assessed. RESULTS: Distributions 
      of ANP and PNE levels at baseline in patients with heart failure of ischemic and 
      nonischemic causes were virtually identical. ANP levels at baseline were
      inversely related to LVEF (r = -0.39; P = .0001), exercise duration (r = -0.19; P
      = .0001), and peak oxygen consumption (r = -0.27; P = .008) and directly related 
      to LV (r = 0.23; P = .0006) and right ventricular dilatation (r = 0.23; P =
      .0008). The increase in ANP levels between baseline and 3 months (P = .02) and 1 
      year (P = .03) was significantly less in the felodipine-ER group than in the
      placebo group, but PNE levels did not differ between treatment groups.
      Hospital-free survival was directly related to baseline ANP (P = .0002) and PNE
      levels (P = .004). All-cause mortality was related to baseline PNE levels (P =
      .02) but not baseline ANP levels. CONCLUSION: Levels of ANP and PNE hormones are 
      related to LV dysfunction, exercise performance, and hospital-free survival in
      heart failure and PNE levels are related to all-cause mortality. Treatment with
      felodipine ER did not adversely affect survival in any neurohormone subclass.

TI  - Progress report on the Nordic diltiazem study (NORDIL): an outcome study in
      hypertensive patients.
PG  - 296-9
AB  - NORDIL--the Nordic Diltiazem Study (NORDIL)--is a prospective, randomized, open
      blinded-endpoint (PROBE), multicenter, parallel-group morbidity/mortality outcome
      study in hypertensive patients designed to compare an intervention strategy based
      on the calcium antagonist diltiazem with a strategy based on conventional
      antihypertensive drug treatment (diuretics or beta-adrenergic blockers). Patient 
      recruitment was started in Norway and Sweden in September 1992, and ended on
      December 15, 1996, when 10.896 male and female patients, aged 50-74 years, with
      essential hypertension had been randomized. In this paper we describe the
      baseline data of the patient cohort and blood pressures achieved in the two
      treatment groups during the early part of the study. The patient cohort consists 
      of 5294 males and 5602 females with a mean age of 59.6 and 60.3 years,
      respectively. Concomitant disorders and risk factors in the cohort are: smoking
      22%, ischemic heart disease 3.0%, previous myocardial infarction (MI) 2.0%,
      previous stroke 1.5%, diabetes mellitus 7.0%, and renal impairment 0.3%. There
      were no differences between the treatment groups in these respects. The blood
      pressure treatment goal is a target diastolic blood pressure of < or =90 mmHg or 
      a 10% diastolic blood pressure reduction from the inclusion pressure. In the
      treatment group randomized to a diltiazem-based treatment strategy, blood
      pressure was 174/106 mmHg at baseline and 156/90 mmHg after 12 months of
      follow-up on active treatment. In the group randomized to a conventional
      treatment strategy, baseline blood pressure at randomization was 173/106 mmHg and
      153/90 mmHg after 12 months on active therapy. The NORDIL study will terminate on
      October 31, 1999 and the final results should be available by mid-2000.

TI  - Felodipine improves left ventricular emptying in patients with chronic heart
      failure: V-HeFT III echocardiographic substudy of multicenter reproducibility and
      detecting functional change.
PG  - 19-28
AB  - BACKGROUND: The echocardiographic substudy of the Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial
      III (V-HeFT III) aimed to determine if felodipine treatment in patients with
      heart failure who were taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor had a
      favorable effect on left ventricular (LV) structure and function. Earlier V-HeFT 
      trials showed that hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate improved ejection fraction
      (EF) and survival, whereas enalapril achieved greater survival with smaller
      increases in EF. Would the combination of a potent vasodilator and enalapril
      produce greater improvements in function and survival? METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Doppler-echocardiographic data were collected from 260 males with heart failure
      who were randomized to felodipine or a placebo. Mean intrasubject differences
      between baseline, at 3 months, and at 12 months were compared. Intersite and
      intrareader reproducibilities were measured from duplicate recordings and
      readings. At 3 months, no changes in ultrasound variables from baseline occurred 
      in either group. At 12 months, felodipine patients achieved greater increases in 
      EF, shortening of LV end-systolic length, and increases in stroke volume index.
      Reproducibility coefficients of variation were 7.4% (EF), 6.0% (end-diastolic
      length), and 13.0% (stroke volume index). CONCLUSIONS: The echocardiographic
      substudy showed that felodipine, added to heart failure therapy, increased EF,
      shortened end-systolic length, and increased stroke volume index. The changes
      were small and confirmed that reproducibility from multiple laboratories can be
      coordinated into a useful research tool.

TI  - Bisoprolol and nifedipine retard in elderly hypertensive patients: effect on
      quality of life.
PG  - 205-12
AB  - Subjects over the age 60 with sustained sitting diastolic pressures of 95-115 mm 
      Hg were randomised to a regime based on bisoprolol (n = 368) or nifedipine retard
      (n = 379) for 24 weeks. The goal diastolic pressure was < or =90 mm Hg and to
      achieve this, double-blind medication could be doubled (5/10 mg bisoprolol, 40/80
      mg nifedipine retard) or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (unblinded) could be added to 
      the higher dose. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 309 subjects in both the
      bisoprolol and nifedipine retard treated group provided at least a baseline and a
      second quality of life assessment (82%). An excess of symptoms was observed in
      the nifedipine group for oedema of the legs, nocturia, constipation, racing heart
      and heart thumping. Fewer patients reported wheeze in the nifedipine group. For
      quality of life, there were no statistically significant differences between the 
      two groups after 8 weeks. However, when analysing the results of the last
      available assessment (usually at 24 weeks) there were significant (P < 0.05)
      improvements in tension/anxiety, anger/ hostility, vigour/activity, and
      confusion/bewilderment, assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) in patients
      receiving bisoprolol in comparison to those receiving nifedipine retard. The
      Sickness Impact Profile and objective tests of cognitive function did not differ 
      statistically between the two groups. Quality of life was maintained at a good
      level on both treatments with advantages for bisoprolol in certain areas. Journal
      of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 205-212.

TI  - Effects of amlodipine on exercise tolerance, quality of life, and left
      ventricular function in patients with heart failure from left ventricular
      systolic dysfunction.
PG  - 503-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: A preliminary study suggested that the long-acting late-generation
      calcium-channel blocker amlodipine has favorable effects on exercise tolerance
      and is safe to use in heart failure, in contrast to earlier generation agents.
      The goal of 2 multicenter studies was to assess the effect of adjunctive therapy 
      with amlodipine in addition to standard therapy on exercise capacity, quality of 
      life, left ventricular function, and safety parameters in patients with heart
      failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. METHODS: Two large multicenter
      trials examining the effects of amlodipine on these parameters over a 12-week
      period of therapy were undertaken in patients with mild to moderate heart failure
      and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. A total of 437 patients with stable
      heart failure were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      prospective design. RESULTS: Amlodipine at a dose of 10 mg/day in addition to
      standard therapy in such patients was associated with no significant difference
      in change in exercise tolerance on a Naughton protocol compared with placebo in
      each trial. Among all patients taking amlodipine, exercise time increased 53 +/- 
      9 (SE) seconds; exercise time for those taking placebo increased 66 +/- 9 seconds
      (P = not significant). There were no significant differences in changes of
      quality of life parameters between amlodipine- and placebo-treated patients, and 
      there were no significant differences in symptom scores or New York Heart
      Association classification between groups. Left ventricular function (measured as
      ejection fraction) improved 3. 4% +/- 0.5% in amlodipine-treated patients and
      1.5% +/- 0.5% in placebo-treated patients (P =.007). There was no statistically
      significant excess of important adverse events (episodes of worsening heart
      failure in 10% amlodipine-treated vs 6.3% of placebo-treated patients) or
      differences in need for changes in background medication between groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: The addition of 10 mg of amlodipine per day to standard therapy in
      patients with heart failure is associated with no significant improvement in
      exercise time compared with placebo therapy over a 12-week period, and there was 
      no increased incidence of adverse events. These data suggest that the addition of
      amlodipine to standard therapy in heart failure will not result in additional
      efficacy per se beyond standard therapy.

TI  - The evidence regarding the drugs used for ventricular rate control.
PG  - 47-59
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to determine what drugs are most efficacious for
      controlling the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. SEARCH
      STRATEGY: We conducted a systematic review of the literature published before May
      1998, beginning with searches of The Cochrane Collaboration's CENTRAL database
      and MEDLINE. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included English-language articles describing
      randomized controlled trials of drugs used for heart rate control in adults with 
      atrial fibrillation. DATA COLLECTION/ANALYSIS: Abstracts of trials were reviewed 
      independently by 2 members of the study team. We reviewed English-language
      abstracts of non-English-language publications to assess qualitative consistency 
      with our results. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five articles evaluating 17 drugs met our
      criteria for review. In the 5 trials of verapamil and 5 of diltiazem, heart rate 
      was reduced significantly (P <.05), both at rest and with exercise, compared with
      placebo, with equivalent or improved exercise tolerance in 6 of 7 comparisons. In
      7 of 12 comparisons of a beta-blocker with placebo, the beta-blocker was
      efficacious for control of resting heart rate, with evidence that the effect is
      drug specific, as nadolol and atenolol proved to be most efficacious. All 9
      comparisons demonstrated good heart rate control with beta-blockers during
      exercise, although exercise tolerance was compromised in 3 of 9 comparisons. In 7
      of 8 trials, digoxin administered alone slowed the resting heart rate more than
      placebo, but it did not significantly slow the rate during exercise in 4 studies.
      The trials evaluating other drugs yielded insufficient evidence to support their 
      use, but those drugs may yet be promising. CONCLUSIONS: The calcium-channel
      blockers verapamil or diltiazem, or select beta-blockers are efficacious for
      heart rate control at rest and during exercise for patients with atrial
      fibrillation without a clinically important decrease in exercise tolerance.
      Digoxin is useful when rate control during exercise is less a concern.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and breast
      cancer.
PG  - 349-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been
      linked to a decreased risk of developing cancer, and longer-term use of calcium
      channel blockers (CCBs) has been associated with an increased risk of developing 
      cancer in general and breast cancer in particular. METHODS: Using data from the
      General Practice Research Database, we conducted a large case-control analysis.
      Previous exposure to ACE inhibitors, CCBs, and beta-blockers was compared between
      3706 postmenopausal women who were diagnosed with incident breast cancer between 
      1992 and 1997 and 14155 matched-control women. RESULTS: Compared with nonusers of
      antihypertensive drugs, women who used ACE inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 1.0; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.5), CCBs (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7-1.2), or
      beta-blockers (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.2) for 5 or more years were not at an
      increased or decreased risk of developing breast cancer (adjusted for smoking and
      body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of
      height in meters]). The risk of breast cancer did not differ between users of
      different ACE inhibitors or different CCBs (dihydropyridines, diltiazem
      hydrochloride, and verapamil hydrochloride) or between users of short-acting (OR,
      1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.4) or sustained-release (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3) nifedipine 
      preparations. CONCLUSION: The findings of this large case-control analysis do not
      support the hypothesis that longer-term use of ACE inhibitors or CCBs affects the
      risk of developing breast cancer.

      artery disease at academic medical centers in the United States and Canada.
      Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial
      (PREVENT) Investigators.
PG  - 343-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) has been well
      established for patients with preexisting coronary artery disease (CAD). However,
      limited information is available assessing the extent to which these medications 
      are prescribed in academic medical centers. METHODS: The use of LLT for patients 
      with CAD was prospectively evaluated in 825 men and women who were recruited from
      16 academic medical centers in the United States and Canada to participate in the
      Prospective Evaluation of the Vascular Events of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT). The
      assessment of LLT use during the 3-year trial was evaluated in patients receiving
      amlodipine therapy and placebo; levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL-C) were used to assess the impact of LLT. RESULTS: Despite a baseline
      prevalence of LLT in 42% of men (38% in 1994), half of the patients had high
      levels of LDL-C (>3.36 mmol [>130 mg/dL]). During the subsequent 3 years, the
      prevalence of elevated LDL-C levels dropped in men (29%) but remained stagnant in
      women (48%). These changes were associated with increased LLT in men (55%) but
      not in women (35%) (P = .04). In 1994, the LDL-C target goal (<2.59 mmol/L [<100 
      mg/dL]) was attained in 17% of men and 6% of women (P = .006). At study
      completion in 1997, the LDL-C target goal was achieved in 31% of men and only 12%
      of women (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the relatively low
      treatment rates of hyperlipidemia among patients with CAD overall and women in
      particular who were participating in a clinical trial at academic medical centers
      in the United States and Canada. Because LLT has been proven to reduce future
      cardiovascular events, these results suggest that more intensive efforts should
      be promoted in order to maximize CAD reduction.

TI  - Long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and metabolic
      control in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 590-600
AB  - Long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and metabolic
      control in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. BACKGROUND: In hypertensive
      type 2 diabetic patients, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular events than
      those treated with calcium channel-blocking agents. However, the long-term renal 
      effects of ACE inhibitors in these patients remain inconclusive. In 1989, we
      commenced a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to examine the
      anti-albuminuric effects of enalapril versus nifedipine (slow release) in 102
      hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients. These patients have been followed up for 
      a mean trial duration of 5.5 +/- 2.2 years. We examined the determinants,
      including the effect of ACE inhibition on clinical outcomes in these patients.
      METHODS: After a six-week placebo-controlled, run-in period, 52 patients were
      randomized double-blind to receive nifedipine (slow release) and 50 patients to
      receive enalapril. After the one-year analysis, which confirmed the superior
      anti-albuminuric effects of enalapril (-54%) over nifedipine (+11%), all patients
      were continued on their previously assigned treatment with informed consent. They
      were subdivided into normoalbuminuric (N = 43), microalbuminuric (N = 34), and
      macroalbuminuric (N = 25) groups based on two of three 24-hour urinary albumin
      excretion (UAE) measurements during the run-in period. Renal function was shown
      by the 24-hour UAE, creatinine clearance (CCr), and the regression coefficient of
      the yearly plasma creatinine reciprocal (beta-1/Cr). Clinical endpoints were
      defined as death, cardiovascular events, and/or renal events (need for renal
      replacement therapy or doubling of baseline plasma creatinine). RESULTS: In the
      whole group, patients treated with enalapril were more likely to revert to being 
      normoalbuminuric (23.8 vs. 15.4%), and fewer of them developed macroalbuminuria
      (19.1 vs. 30.8%) compared with the nifedipine-treated patients (P < 0.05). In the
      microalbuminuric group, treatment with enalapril (N = 21) was associated with a
      13.0% (P < 0.01) reduction in 24-hour UAE compared with a 17.3% increase in the
      nifedipine group (N = 13). In the macroalbuminuric patients, enalapril treatment 
      (N = 11) was associated with stabilization compared with a decline in renal
      function in the nifedipine group, as shown by the beta-1/Cr (0.65 +/- 4.29 vs.
      -1.93 +/- 2.35 1/micromol x 10-3, P < 0.05) after adjustment for baseline values.
      Compared with the normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients, those with
      macroalbuminuria had the lowest mean CCr (75.5 +/- 24.1 vs. 63.5 +/- 21.3 vs.
      41.9 +/- 18.5 mL/min, P < 0.001) and the highest frequency of clinical events
      (4.7 vs. 5.9 vs. 52%, P < 0. 001). On multivariate analysis, beta-1/Cr (R2 =
      0.195, P < 0.001) was independently associated with baseline HbA1c (beta =
      -0.285, P = 0.004), whereas clinical outcomes (R2 = 0.176, P < 0.001) were
      independently related to the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta =
      2.426, P = 0.018), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = -8.797, P =
      0.03), baseline UAE (beta = 0.002, P = 0.04), and mean CCr during treatment (beta
      = -0.211, P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: In this prospective cohort analysis involving
      102 hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients with varying degrees of albuminuria
      followed up for a mean duration of five years, we observed the importance of good
      metabolic and blood pressure control on the progression of albuminuria and renal 
      function. Treatment with enalapril was associated with a greater reduction in
      albuminuria than with nifedipine in the entire patient group, and especially in
      those with microalbuminuria. In the macroalbuminuric patients, the rate of
      deterioration in renal function was also attenuated by treatment with enalapril.

TI  - Randomized double-blind comparison of a calcium antagonist and a diuretic in
      elderly hypertensives. National Intervention Cooperative Study in Elderly
      Hypertensives Study Group.
PG  - 1129-33
AB  - Although diuretics are recommended for the treatment of hypertension, decreased
      diuretic use and increased calcium antagonist use necessitate a comparison of the
      efficacy of these drugs in preventing cardiovascular events. Patients >/=60 years
      of age with systolic blood pressure of 160 to 220 mm Hg and diastolic blood
      pressure <115 mm Hg were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to 20 mg of
      sustained-release nicardipine hydrochloride twice daily or 2 mg of
      trichlormethiazide once daily by the double-dummy method and followed up for 5
      years. A total of 414 patients were analyzed: 204 in the nicardipine group and
      210 in the diuretic group. Blood pressure at entry was 172/94 mm Hg and 173/93 mm
      Hg, respectively, and decreased to 147/81 mm Hg and 147/79 mm Hg, respectively.
      Cardiovascular morbidity rates per 1000 persons per year were similar in the
      nicardipine and diuretic groups (27.8 and 26.8, respectively; P=0.923). The sex- 
      and age-adjusted risk ratio for the nicardipine group was 0.973 (95% confidence
      interval, 0.514 to 1.839, P=0.932). The calcium antagonist and diuretic groups
      had a similarly decreased rate of cardiovascular events.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers and mortality in elderly patients with myocardial
      infarction.
PG  - 2341-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although calcium channel blockers are a useful therapy in relieving
      angina, lowering blood pressure, and slowing conduction of atrial fibrillation,
      growing evidence has cast doubt on their safety in patients with coronary
      disease. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between calcium channel blocker
      therapy at hospital discharge and mortality in a population-based sample of
      elderly patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN:
      Retrospective cohort study using data from medical charts and administrative
      files. SETTING: All acute care hospitals in 46 states. PATIENTS: All Medicare
      patients with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction consecutively 
      discharged from the hospital alive during 8-month periods between 1994 and 1995
      (N = 141,041). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mortality at 30 days and 1 year. RESULTS:
      Calcium channel blockers were widely prescribed at hospital discharge to elderly 
      patients with myocardial infarction between 1994 and 1995 (n = 51,921), the most 
      commonly prescribed being diltiazem (n = 21,175), nifedipine (n = 12,670),
      amlodipine (n = 11,683), and verapamil (n = 3639). After adjusting for illness
      severity and concomitant medication use, patients who were prescribed calcium
      channel blockers at hospital discharge did not have increased risk for 30-day or 
      1-year mortality, with the exception of the few (n = 116) treated with bepridil. 
      Bepridil differs from other calcium channel blockers because of its tendency to
      prolong repolarization, and its association with proarrhythmic effects in elderly
      patients. CONCLUSION: We did not identify a mortality risk in a large consecutive
      sample of elderly patients with myocardial infarction, which supports the need
      for additional prospective trials examining calcium channel blocker therapy for
      ischemic heart disease.

TI  - Cohort study on calcium channel blockers, other cardiovascular agents, and the
      prevalence of depression.
PG  - 230-3
AB  - AIMS: Some reports have suggested that calcium channel blockers may be associated
      with an increased incidence of depression or suicide. There is a paucity of
      evidence from large scale studies. The aim of this study was to assess rates of
      depression with calcium channel antagonists using data from prescription event
      monitoring studies. METHODS: Observational studies on large cohorts of patients
      using lisinopril, enalapril (ACE inhibitors), nicardipine (type 2 calcium channel
      blocker) and diltiazem (type 3 calcium channel blocker) were conducted, using
      prescription-event monitoring. Rates of depression in the different drugs and
      rate ratios (95% CI) were computed. RESULTS: The crude overall rates of
      depression during treatment were 1.89, 1.92 and 1.62 per 1000 patient months for 
      the ACE inhibitors, diltiazem and nicardipine, respectively. Using the ACE
      inhibitors as the reference group, the rate ratios for depression were 1.07 (0.
      82-1.40) and 0.86 (0.69-1.08) for diltiazem and nicardipine, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the hypothesis that calcium channel
      blockers are associated with depression, when considering patients treated in
      general practice in the UK.

TI  - Effects of long-acting versus short-acting calcium channel blockers among older
      survivors of acute myocardial infarction.
PG  - 512-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have highlighted the potentially harmful effects of
      short-acting calcium channel blockers, especially of the dihydropyridine type, in
      patients with coronary heart disease. Some have argued that long-acting calcium
      channel blockers are safer, but few outcome data exist. The objective of the
      study was to compare the occurrence of adverse outcomes among recipients of
      long-acting versus short-acting calcium channel blockers, with dihydropyridines
      and non-dihydropyridines compared separately. SETTING: The New Jersey Medicare
      population. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using linked Medicare and drug
      claims data. PARTICIPANTS: Older survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI)
      occurring in 1989 and 1990. Eligible subjects had survived at least 30 days after
      the MI, participated in Medicare and a drug benefits program, and were prescribed
      a single type of either a long-acting or a short-acting calcium channel blocker
      within 90 days after the MI. MEASUREMENTS: The two outcome measures were rates of
      all-cause mortality and cardiac rehospitalization. Using separate Cox regression 
      models for dihydropyridines (nifedipine, nicardipine) and non-dihydropyridines
      (diltiazem, verapamil), we examined these outcomes for recipients of long-acting 
      compared with short-acting calcium channel blockers. RESULTS: Of the 833 patients
      eligible for the study, 160 were prescribed long-acting and 673 short-acting
      calcium channel blockers. Clinical characteristics of long-acting and
      short-acting users were comparable. During 2 years of follow-up, 221 deaths and
      300 rehospitalizations occurred. Controlling for age, sex, race, and indicators
      of disease severity and comorbidity, the relative risk of dying for recipients of
      long-acting, compared with short-acting, dihydropyridines was .42 (95% confidence
      interval (CI), 0.21-0.86). For cardiac rehospitalization, the relative risk was
      0.57 (95% CI, 0.34-0.94). For the long-acting versus short-acting
      nondihydropyridines, the adjusted relative risk of dying was 1.43 (95% CI,
      0.88-2.32), and for cardiac rehospitalization, .65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.05).
      CONCLUSION: Use of long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers after
      acute MI was associated with substantially lower rates of cardiac
      rehospitalization and death compared with use of their short-acting counterparts.
      More data are needed to address the possibility that long-acting, compared with
      short-acting, non-dihydropyridines could decrease rehospitalization rates but
      increase mortality.

TI  - Physical Symptoms Distress Index: a sensitive tool to evaluate the impact of
      pharmacological agents on quality of life.
PG  - 693-700
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the degree of stress associated with adverse
      physical side effects correlates with overall quality of life (QOL) and
      compliance rates. To determine if instruments used to assess QOL can detect
      differences between treatments that have no known central nervous system effects.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, parallel group study
      evaluated 180 to 480 mg of controlled onset, extended release (COER)-verapamil (n
      = 259) or 30 to 120 mg/d of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS)
      (n = 269) in men and women between 21 and 80 years of age with stages 1 to 3
      hypertension. A battery of questions evaluating psychological well-being and a
      physical symptom distress index was administered after a 4-week placebo washout
      (baseline) and after 10 weeks of treatment or at dropout. RESULTS: Both
      treatments effectively lowered blood pressure, and there were no significant
      between-group differences in psychosocial QOL. A difference in the level of
      physical symptom distress was detected between treatments (P = .002; multivariate
      analysis of variance), with 7 significant univariate treatment effects, all
      favoring COER-verapamil, being noted-pedal edema, polyuria, rapid heart beat or
      palpitations, hives, muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, and headaches.
      Constipation-related distress increased significantly (P = .001) but to a similar
      extent with both treatments. The difference in symptom distress tended to predict
      compliance as there were more withdrawals in the nifedipine GITS group (n = 85)
      vs COER-verapamil group (n = 64) (P = .08). CONCLUSIONS: Patient-assessed
      physical symptom distress is a sensitive, simple technique to evaluate the effect
      of antihypertensive medications on QOL and tolerability, as shown by its ability 
      to detect the improvement associated with COER-verapamil. Depending on the agents
      involved, the Physical Symptom Distress Index may more closely predict dropout
      rates than the traditional psychosocial instruments, as suggested by the lower
      dropout rate in the COER-verapamil group. Thus, in studying treatment effects on 
      QOL, both the distress of physical symptoms and the impact of psychosocial
      factors should be evaluated.

TI  - Incidence of cancer in postmyocardial infarction patients treated with
      short-acting nifedipine and diltiazem. Secondary Prevention Group.
PG  - 1369-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports suggest a possible link between nifedipine (but not
      diltiazem) and an increased risk of cancer in patients being treated with calcium
      antagonists. METHODS: A total of 1054 postmyocardial infarction patients were
      divided randomly into those being treated with calcium antagonists (n = 566
      [nifedipine, 425 patients and diltiazem, 141 patients]) and controls (no calcium 
      antagonist; n = 488). The patients were followed for 26.3 months, and the
      incidences of cardiac events as well as cancer were compared among the 3 groups. 
      RESULTS: Thirteen patients (2.7%) in the control group developed cancer, whereas 
      15 patients in the nifedipine group (3.5%; odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence
      interval [95% CI], 0.63-2.85) and 3 patients in the diltiazem group (2.1%; odds
      ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.27-2.93) developed cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Diltiazem appears 
      to present no increased risk of cancer. The incidence of cancer was slightly
      higher in the patients receiving nifedipine than in those not being treated with 
      a calcium antagonist, which is consistent with earlier reports; however, this
      increase was not statistically significant.

TI  - Ventricular rate control in chronic atrial fibrillation during daily activity and
      programmed exercise: a crossover open-label study of five drug regimens.
PG  - 304-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of five pharmacologic regimens on the
      circadian rhythm and exercise-induced changes of ventricular rate (VR) in
      patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF). BACKGROUND: Systematic
      comparison of standardized drug regimens on 24 h VR control in CAF have not been 
      reported. METHODS: In 12 patients (11 male, 69+/-6 yr) with CAF, the effects on
      VR by 5 standardized daily regimens: 1) 0.25 mg digoxin, 2) 240 mg diltiazem-CD, 
      3) 50 mg atenolol, 4) 0.25 mg digoxin + 240 mg diltiazem-CD, and 5) 0.25 mg
      digoxin + 50 mg atenolol; were studied after 2 week treatment assigned in random 
      order. The VR data were analyzed by ANOVA with repeated measures. The circadian
      phase differences were evaluated by cosinor analysis. RESULTS: The 24-h mean
      (+/-SD) values of VR (bpm) were - digoxin: 78.9 +/- 16.3, diltiazem: 80.0+/-15.5,
      atenolol: 75.9+/-11.7, digoxin + diltiazem: 67.3+/-14.1 and digoxin + atenolol:
      65.0+/-9.4. Circadian patterns were significant in each treatment group (p <
      0.001). The VR on digoxin + atenolol was significantly lower than that on digoxin
      (p < 0.0001), diltiazem (p < 0.0002) and atenolol (p < 0.001). The time of peak
      VR on Holter was significantly delayed with regimens 3 and 5 which included
      atenolol (p < 0.03). During exercise, digoxin and digoxin + atenolol treatments
      resulted in the highest and lowest mean VR respectively. The exercise Time-VR
      plots of all groups were nearly parallel (p = ns). The exercise duration was
      similar in all treatment groups (p = ns). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that 
      digoxin and diltiazem, as single agents at the doses tested, are least effective 
      for controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation during daily activity.
      Digoxin + atenolol produced the most effective rate control reflecting a
      synergistic effect on the AV node. The data provides a basis for testing the
      effects of chronic suppression of diurnal fluctuations of VR on left atrial and
      ventricular function in CAF.

TI  - Safety of nifedipine in angina pectoris: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 24-31
AB  - -Our objective was to compare cardiovascular event rates in patients with stable 
      angina receiving nifedipine as monotherapy or combination therapy and in active
      drug controls. A MEDLARS search of published articles from 1966 to 1995 in
      English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish, supplemented by a manual search of 
      bibliographies, identified 60 randomized controlled trials that met protocol
      criteria. Blinded articles were extracted by 2 physicians. The pooled risks of
      death, withdrawal, and cardiovascular event were computed and expressed as odds
      ratios (ORs) for all nifedipine formulations and relative to same study control
      drug regimens. Thirty cardiovascular events were reported in 2635 nifedipine
      exposures (1.14%) and 19 events in 2655 other active drug exposures (0.72%).
      Unadjusted ORs for nifedipine versus controls were 1.40 (95% CI, 0.56 to 3.49)
      for major events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke,
      revascularization procedure), 1.75 (95% CI, 0.83 to 3.67) for increased angina,
      and 1.61 (95% CI, 0.91 to 2.87) for all events (major events plus increased
      angina). Episodes of increased angina were more frequent on immediate-release
      nifedipine (OR, 4.19 [95% CI, 1.41 to 12.49]) and on nifedipine monotherapy (OR, 
      2.61 [95% CI, 1.30 to 5.26]). The OR for immediate-release nifedipine was
      significantly higher than that for sustained-release/extended-release nifedipine 
      (P=0.001), and the OR for nifedipine monotherapy was higher than that for
      nifedipine combination therapy (P=0.03). Increased risks of cardiovascular events
      in patients with stable angina on nifedipine were due primarily to more episodes 
      of increased angina, confined to the immediate-release formulation and to
      nifedipine monotherapy.

TI  - Quality of life and calcium channel blockade with nifedipine GITS versus
      amlodipine in hypertensive patients in Spain. Gastrointestinal Therapeutic
      System.
PG  - 1839-47
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compliance with hypertension treatment is affected by
      treatment-related factors (complexity, side effects), efficacy and
      compound-specific effects that impact on quality of life. This study examined the
      differences in quality of life produced by two once-daily calcium channel
      blockers using different delivery systems: nifedipine gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system (GITS) and amlodipine. DESIGN: This was a double-blind,
      double-dummy, randomized clinical trial comparing nifedipine GITS (30 mg) and
      amlodipine (5 mg) for 24 weeks following a placebo run-in. Clinical, laboratory
      evaluations and quality-of-life data were assessed at screening, baseline
      randomization and three times during active therapy. SETTING: The study was
      conducted in 13 medical clinics in Spain. PATIENTS: The sample comprised 430
      screened and 356 randomized patients with mild to moderate hypertension
      (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mmHg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in systolic
      and diastolic blood pressure and in health-related quality of life were the main 
      outcome measures. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between active
      treatment groups in the blood pressure changes (systolic blood pressure:
      nifedipine GITS -15.5 mmHg; amlodipine -15.7 mmHg). Spontaneous adverse events
      consistent with calcium channel blockage were not different. The nifedipine GITS 
      group improved in all quality-of-life measures except Sexual Symptom Distress and
      showed a significantly greater improvement than amlodipine in overall Quality of 
      Life (P< 0.05), General Perceived Health (P < 0.026) and its subscale Vitality (P
      < 0.019). The amlodipine group declined in overall Quality of Life, General
      Perceived Health, Vitality and Sleep Disturbance, and significantly in Sexual
      Symptom Distress (P < 0.045). However, this group improved in self-reported
      Cognitive Functioning (P=0.036), Mental Acuity (P < 0.005) and
      Detachment/disorientation (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest
      compound-specific effects on quality of life that may be due to differences in
      the delivery system. Nifedipine GITS is short-acting (2 h half-life) and is
      delivered continuously over a 24 h period, while amlodipine has a half-life of 40
      h, which may produce more sustained low-level effects. While a more beneficial
      profile was observed for nifedipine, amlodipine demonstrated potential positive
      effects on cognitive functioning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of permanent atrial fibrillation (PAF) consists
      primarily of long-term anticoagulation with either aspirin or warfarin to prevent
      systemic embolization, and modulation of ventricular rate (VR) to improve cardiac
      function by prolonging the ventricular diastolic filling time. HYPOTHESIS: The
      effects of slow-release formulations of gallopamil (100 mg b.i.d.), diltiazem
      (120 mg b.i.d.), or verapamil (120 mg b.i.d.) on VR were evaluated in 18 patients
      with PAF without organic heart disease. METHODS: In all patients, each treatment 
      was administered randomly, was compared with oral digoxin, and was assessed by
      24-h Holter monitoring during daily life and by a 6-min walking test. RESULTS:
      There were no significant differences in mean and minimum VR recorded during 24-h
      Holter monitoring among the four treatments. Peak heart rates recorded during the
      6-min walking test with digoxin treatment was 167 +/- 12 beats/min. This was
      significantly reduced by gallopamil (149 +/- 23 beats/min, p = 0.01), diltiazem
      (142 +/- 24 beats/min, p < 0.001), and verapamil (137 +/- 30 beats/min, p <
      0.001). There were no significant differences in peak VR during the walking test 
      among the three calcium antagonists. Pauses of > 3 s were observed in 3 of 18
      (17%) patients who received digoxin (max 3.4 s) and in 5 of 18 (28%) patients who
      received diltiazem (max 3.4 s); p = NS. Periods of bradycardia < 30 beats/min
      were observed in 5 of 18 (28%) patients during digoxin treatment, and in 3 of 18 
      (17%) patients during treatment with gallopamil, diltiazem, and verapamil; p =
      NS. CONCLUSION: Gallopamil, diltiazem, or verapamil are superior to digoxin in
      controlling VR during mild exercise in patients with PAF without organic heart
      disease. The reduction of peak VR is obtainable without further slowing of
      resting VR. However, gallopamil appears to be the least effective calcium blocker
      at controlling resting and exercise VR; thus, there are no advantages over the
      other calcium blockers in its use in the clinical setting.

TI  - Rationale and design of the International Verapamil SR/Trandolapril Study
      (INVEST): an Internet-based randomized trial in coronary artery disease patients 
      with hypertension.
PG  - 1228-37
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the International Verapamil SR/Trandolapril 
      Study (INVEST) is to compare the risk for adverse outcomes (all-cause mortality, 
      nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or nonfatal stroke) in hypertensive patients 
      with coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with either a calcium antagonist-based
      or a noncalcium antagonist-based strategy. BACKGROUND: Treatment recommendations 
      for hypertension include initial therapy with a diuretic or beta-adrenergic
      blocking agent, for which reductions in morbidity and mortality are documented
      from randomized trials but are less than expected from epidemiologic data. For
      this reason, recent attention has focused on calcium antagonists or
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. While these agents reduce blood
      pressure, outcome data from large randomized trials are lacking, but some
      case-control data, dominated by short-acting dihydropyridines, suggest an
      increased risk of cardiovascular events. These studies had methodologic
      limitations and did not differentiate among calcium antagonist types and
      formulations. Several studies differentiating among calcium antagonist types and 
      an overview of published randomized trials show no increased risk with verapamil 
      and suggestion for benefit in CAD patients. METHODS: A total of 27,000 CAD
      patients with hypertension will be randomized at 1,500 primary care sites to
      receive either a calcium antagonist-based (verapamil) or
      beta-blocker/diuretic-based (atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide) antihypertensive care 
      strategy. The study uses a novel, electronic "paper-less" system for direct
      on-screen data entry, randomization and drug distribution from a mail pharmacy
      linked to the coordination center via the Internet. RESULTS: Contract
      negotiations with the United States and international sites are ongoing. Patients
      being enrolled are predominantly elderly (72% aged 60 years or older) men (54%), 
      with either an abnormal coronary angiogram or prior MI (71%). In addition to
      hypertension, CAD and elderly age, most patients (89%) have one or more
      associated conditions (diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, cerebral or peripheral
      vascular disease, etc.) contributing to increased risk for adverse outcome. While
      26% have diabetes, most of these are noninsulin dependent. Using the protocol
      strategies, target blood pressures (according to JNC VI) have been reached in 58%
      at the fourth visit, and as expected most (89%) are requiring multiple
      antihypertensive drugs. CONCLUSION: The design and baseline characteristics of
      the initial patients recruited for a prospective, randomized, international,
      multicenter study comparing two therapeutic strategies to control hypertension in
      CAD patients are described.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine on mode of death among patients with advanced heart failure 
      in the PRAISE trial. Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation.
PG  - 881-7
AB  - Investigations of calcium antagonists in patients with advanced heart failure
      have raised concern over an increased risk of worsening heart failure and heart
      failure deaths. We assessed the effect of amlodipine on cause-specific mortality 
      in such patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial. In total, 1,153 patients in New York Heart Association class IIIb or IV
      heart failure were randomized to receive amlodipine or placebo, along with
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. Over a median
      14.5 months of follow-up, 413 patients died. Cardiovascular deaths accounted for 
      89% of fatalities, 50% of which were sudden deaths and 45% of which were due to
      pump failure, with fewer attributed to myocardial infarction (3.3%) or other
      cardiovascular causes (1.6%). Amlodipine treatment resulted in a greater relative
      reduction in sudden deaths (21%) than in pump failure deaths (6.6%) overall. When
      patients were classified by etiology of heart failure (ischemic or nonischemic), 
      cause-specific mortality did not differ significantly between treatment groups in
      the ischemic stratum. In the nonischemic stratum, however, sudden deaths and pump
      failure deaths were reduced by 38% and 45%, respectively, with amlodipine. Thus, 
      when added to digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
      in patients with advanced heart failure, amlodipine appears to have no effect on 
      cause-specific mortality in ischemic cardiomyopathy, but both pump failure and
      sudden deaths appear to be decreased in nonischemic heart failure patients
      treated with amlodipine.

      Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) Trial.
PG  - 370-90
AB  - The Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints
      (CONVINCE) Trial is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, parallel-group,
      two-arm, actively controlled, multicenter, international 5-year clinical trial
      involving 15,000 patients. CONVINCE will compare the incidence of fatal or
      nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, or
      cardiovascular-disease-related death in two antihypertensive treatment regimens. 
      One treatment arm begins with controlled onset-extended release (COER)-verapamil,
      which has its major antihypertensive effect 6-12 hours after administration. The 
      other arm (standard of care (SOC)) begins with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 
      or atenolol, one of which is preselected by the investigator for an individual
      patient prior to randomization. Secondary objectives include comparisons of the
      regimens for each of the components of the primary endpoint (separately), death
      or hospitalization related to cardiovascular disease, efficacy in lowering blood 
      pressure to goal, primary events occurring between 6 am and noon, all-cause
      mortality, withdrawals from blinded therapy, cancer, and hospitalizations due to 
      bleeding. Patients may be enrolled if they are hypertensive and at least 55 years
      of age and have an established second risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
      Initial medications include COER-verapamil (180 mg/d), HCTZ (12.5 mg/d), or
      atenolol (50 mg/d). Initial doses are doubled if blood pressure (BP) does not
      reach goal (systolic BP < 140 mm and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If BP is not
      controlled by the higher dose of the initial medication, HCTZ is added to
      COER-verapamil, or the SOC choice not initially selected is added in the SOC arm.
      An ACE-inhibitor is recommended (although nearly any open-label medication is
      allowed) as the third step for patients whose BP is not adequately controlled or 
      who have a contraindication to one of the two SOC medications. Patients take two 
      sets of tablets daily, one in the morning and one in the evening. Although most
      patients switch from an established antihypertensive medication to randomized
      treatment, untreated patients with stages I-III hypertension (SBP between 140 and
      190 or DBP between 90 and 110 mm Hg) are eligible. Outcomes are monitored by an
      independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Enrollment began during the third
      quarter of 1996, and follow-up is to be completed in the third quarter of 2002.

TI  - Amlodipine versus diltiazem as additional antianginal treatment to atenolol.
      Centralised European Studies in Angina Research (CESAR) Investigators.
PG  - 133-6
AB  - The antianginal efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine and diltiazem were
      compared in a double-blind randomized trial of 97 patients with angina resistant 
      to atenolol alone. Both amlodipine and diltiazem significantly reduced the
      frequency of angina attacks (p <0.001) and glyceryl trinitrate consumption (p
      <0.05 to p <0.01). During Holter monitoring, both treatments reduced the overall 
      frequency of ambulatory myocardial ischemia, although changes did not reach
      statistical significance. Exercise test parameters (total exercise time, time to 
      angina, time to ST depression, and maximum ST depression) tended to improve with 
      both treatments, but changes did not achieve statistical significance relative to
      baseline or to each other. Both drugs were generally well tolerated. Adverse
      events occurred in 15 patients in the amlodipine group (30%) and in 17 patients
      in the diltiazem group (36%), but patients taking diltiazem reported almost twice
      as many adverse events (30) patients taking amlodipine (18). Quality of life, as 
      assessed by total Nottingham Health Profile Scores, was not significantly
      different between treatments. The addition of either once-daily amlodipine or
      twice-daily sustained release diltiazem improved symptoms in patients with angina
      resistant to atenolol alone, but diltiazem was associated with more frequent and 
      more serious adverse events.

TI  - Value of the addition of amlodipine to atenolol in patients with angina pectoris 
      despite adequate beta blockade.
PG  - 128-32
AB  - Anginal patients who remain symptomatic despite optimally dosed beta blockade may
      also be given dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. This treatment regimen was
      examined in a double-blind parallel, randomized, controlled study in 147 patients
      with angina and positive bicycle exercise tests despite optimal beta blockade
      with atenolol (heart rate at rest <60 beats/min). Patients were randomized to
      atenolol and/or placebo (control), and atenolol and/or amlodipine. The main
      outcome measurement was exercise tolerance after 8 weeks compared with baseline. 
      After 8 weeks, no significant differences in time to 0.1-mV ST-segment
      depression, time to chest pain, and time to end of exercise were observed. The
      number of patients with chest pain during exercise decreased significantly in the
      amlodipine group (p = 0.04 vs controls). The subgroup of patients with an early
      (<6 minutes) onset of chest pain at baseline showed a significant increase in
      time to chest pain after amlodipine (p = 0.0001 vs controls). In the amlodipine
      group, ST depression and rate-pressure product at submaximum comparable workload 
      decreased to 0.4 mm (0.56) (p = 0.03 vs controls) and 1.223 (2.652) beats/ min x 
      mm Hg (p = 0.01 vs controls). The number of patients in each group with adverse
      events was not different. The addition of amlodipine to the treatment of patients
      with myocardial ischemia, despite optimal beta blockade, is well tolerated and
      may lead to improvement in symptomatic anginal patients, who have a rapid onset
      of exercise-induced ischemia.

TI  - Outcome results of the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events
      Randomized Trial (FACET) in patients with hypertension and NIDDM.
PG  - 597-603
AB  - OBJECTIVE: ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may favorably affect serum
      lipids and glucose metabolism. The primary aim of the Fosinopril Versus
      Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial (FACET) was to compare the
      effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in
      NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events
      were assessed as secondary outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Inclusion
      criteria included a diagnosis of NIDDM and hypertension (systolic blood pressure 
      of > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mmHg). Exclusion criteria
      included a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5
      mg/dl, albuminuria > 40 micrograms/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin,
      or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics. A total of 380 
      hypertensive diabetics were randomly assigned to open-label fosinopril (20
      mg/day) or amlodipine (10 mg/day) and followed for up to 3.5 years. If blood
      pressure was not controlled, the other study drug was added. RESULTS: Both
      treatments were effective in lowering blood pressure. At the end of follow-up,
      between the two groups there was no significant difference in total serum
      cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting serum glucose, or plasma insulin.
      The patients receiving fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of the combined 
      outcome of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalized angina than those
      receiving amlodipine (14/189 vs. 27/191; hazards ratio = 0.49, 95% CI =
      0.26-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Fosinopril and amlodipine had similar effects on
      biochemical measures, but the patients randomized to fosinopril had a
      significantly lower risk of major vascular events, compared with the patients
      randomized to amlodipine.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers and the risk of cancer.
PG  - 1000-4
AB  - CONTEXT: Recent epidemiologic studies have raised the concern that calcium
      channel blocker use may increase the risk of cancer overall and of several
      specific cancers. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether calcium channel blocker use
      increases the risk of cancer overall and of specific cancers. DESIGN:
      Case-control drug surveillance study based on data collected from 1983 to 1996.
      SETTING: Hospitals in Baltimore, Md, New York, NY, and Philadelphia, Pa.
      PATIENTS: A total of 9513 patients aged 40 to 69 years with incident cancer of
      various sites and 6492 controls aged 40 to 69 years admitted for nonmalignant
      conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident cancer overall and 23 specific
      cancers. RESULTS: Calcium channel blocker use was unrelated to the risk of cancer
      overall (relative risk [RR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-1.3). Use was
      not significantly associated with increased risks of individual cancers,
      including those previously implicated, except cancer of the kidney (RR, 1.8; 95% 
      CI, 1.1 -2.7). Recent use, use for 5 or more years, and use of individual calcium
      channel blocker drugs were also not associated with cancer incidence. Use of
      beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was generally
      unrelated to cancer overall or individual cancers, but both were associated with 
      kidney cancer (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5; and RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0,
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the use of calcium
      channel blockers is unrelated to an increase in the overall risk of cancer or of 
      individual cancers, except kidney cancer, which has been associated with
      hypertension or drugs to treat hypertension in previous studies.

TI  - Calcium channel blocking agents and risk of cancer in patients with coronary
      heart disease. Benzafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study Research Group.
PG  - 804-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This analysis sought to estimate the risk ratio for cancer incidence 
      and cancer-related mortality associated with the use of calcium channel blocking 
      agents (CCBs) in a large group of patients with chronic coronary heart disease
      (CHD). BACKGROUND: Recent publications contend that the use of short-acting CCBs 
      may double the risk of cancer incidence and possibly increase mortality in
      hypertensive patients. METHODS: Cancer incidence data were obtained for 11,575
      patients screened for the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study, one-half
      of whom were treated at the time of screening with CCBs, over a mean follow-up
      period of 2.8 years. Cause-specific mortality was available through September
      1996 (mean follow-up 5.2 years). The statistical power of detecting an odds ratio
      > or = 1.5 (given the cancer incidence rate of 2.1 in the nonusers of CCBs) was
      0.91. The power declined to 0.77, 0.54 and 0.41, with declining odds ratios of
      1.4, 1.3 and 1.25, respectively. RESULTS: Of 246 incident cancer cases, 129
      occurred among the users (2.3%) and 117 among nonusers of CCBs (2.1%). After
      adjustment for age, gender and smoking, the odds ratio estimates for all cancers 
      combined was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 1.37) for CCB users
      relative to nonusers. The adjusted risk ratio for all-cause mortality for age,
      gender and smoking and pertinent prognostic clinical characteristics was
      estimated at 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.04). The adjusted risk ratio for
      cancer-related mortality was 1.03 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.41). CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      with CHD treated with CCBs exhibited a similar risk of cancer incidence and total
      and cancer-related mortality compared with nonusers of CCBs. This analysis
      provides a certain assurance that CCB use in middle-aged and elderly patients
      with CHD is not associated with a meaningful difference in cancer incidence and
      related mortality.

TI  - The effect of nisoldipine as compared with enalapril on cardiovascular outcomes
      in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.
PG  - 645-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has recently been reported that the use of calcium-channel
      blockers for hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of
      cardiovascular complications. Because this issue remains controversial, we
      studied the incidence of such complications in patients with
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension who were randomly
      assigned to treatment with either the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine or the 
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril as part of a larger study.
      METHODS: The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) Trial is a
      prospective, randomized, blinded trial comparing the effects of moderate control 
      of blood pressure (target diastolic pressure, 80 to 89 mm Hg) with those of
      intensive control of blood pressure (diastolic pressure, 75 mm Hg) on the
      incidence and progression of complications of diabetes. The study also compared
      nisoldipine with enalapril as a first-line antihypertensive agent in terms of the
      prevention and progression of complications of diabetes. In the current study, we
      analyzed data on a secondary end point (the incidence of myocardial infarction)
      in the subgroup of patients in the ABCD Trial who had hypertension. RESULTS:
      Analysis of the 470 patients in the trial who had hypertension (base-line
      diastolic blood pressure, > or = 90 mm Hg) showed similar control of blood
      pressure, blood glucose and lipid concentrations, and smoking behavior in the
      nisoldipine group (237 patients) and the enalapril group (233 patients)
      throughout five years of follow-up. Using a multiple logistic-regression model
      with adjustment for cardiac risk factors, we found that nisoldipine was
      associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions
      (a total of 24) than enalapril (total, 4) (risk ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence
      interval, 2.7 to 33.8). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of patients with diabetes
      and hypertension, we found a significantly higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal
      myocardial infarction among those assigned to therapy with the calcium-channel
      blocker nisoldipine than among those assigned to receive enalapril. Since our
      findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation.

TI  - Risk of serious adverse events in hypertensive patients receiving isradipine: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 743-51
AB  - A meta-analysis was performed to compare the risk of serious adverse events
      associated with the use of all formulations of isradipine, when used as
      monotherapy in hypertension, to active drug or placebo controls. Eligible studies
      totalled 65 published and unpublished randomised controlled trials involving 9903
      subjects and 10,675 treatment exposures: 4492 to isradipine, 1473 to isradipine
      sustained release, 2768 to other active drugs, and 1942 to placebo. Mortality,
      cardiovascular outcomes, other serious incident illnesses, such as cancer, and
      withdrawals were sought. Seventy-five per cent of the isradipine exposures were
      to standard-release formulations and 25% were to sustained-release formulations. 
      Overall, isradipine therapy shows no difference in risk of major adverse events
      or withdrawals compared to other active controls or placebo (odds ratios [OR]
      0.9; 95% CI 0.7-1.46 and 0.5; 95% CI 0.2-1.3). These major adverse events
      included angina, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and overall
      mortality. Isradipine sustained release could be compared only to placebo, based 
      on available data, and shows a lower risk of withdrawals (OR 0.5; 95% CI
      0.3-0.9), and a similar trend was observed for major adverse events, (OR 0.8; 95%
      CI 0.3-2.5). Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials were analysed
      in separate meta-analyses and later combined when this sensitivity analysis of
      risk showed no differences between the groups. In conclusion, we find no evidence
      for increased risk of serious adverse events in patients receiving isradipine as 
      monotherapy for hypertension.

TI  - Effect of the calcium antagonist felodipine as supplementary vasodilator therapy 
      in patients with chronic heart failure treated with enalapril: V-HeFT III.
      Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT) Study Group.
PG  - 856-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors and digoxin morbidity 
      and mortality in heart failure remain high and might respond favorably to an
      additional vasodilator. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male patients (n=450) with chronic
      heart failure (cardiac dysfunction and impaired exercise performance) on optimal 
      current therapy (97% enalapril, 89% diuretics) were randomly assigned to
      double-blind treatment with felodipine extended release (5 mg BID) or placebo for
      3 to 39 months (average, 18 months). Felodipine significantly reduced blood
      pressure and, at 3 months, increased ejection fraction (2.1% versus -0.1% units
      in the placebo group, P=.001) and reduced plasma atrial natriuretic peptide
      levels (-2.9 versus 26.9 pg/mL in the placebo group, P=.01) but did not improve
      exercise tolerance, quality of life, or the need for hospitalization. During
      long-term follow-up, the favorable effects on ejection fraction and atrial
      peptide did not persist, but felodipine prevented worsening exercise tolerance
      and quality of life. In the felodipine and placebo groups, mortality (13.8%
      versus 12.8%, respectively) and hospitalization (43% versus 42%) rates were
      similar, and a higher incidence of peripheral edema was the only apparent side
      effect of felodipine therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Felodipine exerts a well-tolerated
      additional sustained vasodilator effect in patients with heart failure treated
      with enalapril, but the only possible long-term benefit was a trend for better
      exercise tolerance and less depression of quality of life in the second year of
      treatment. The drug appears to be safe but not clearly efficacious in patients
      with heart failure.

TI  - Safety of nifedipine in patients with hypertension: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 7-14
AB  - Our objective was to compare cardiovascular event rates in patients with mild or 
      moderate hypertension who received nifedipine with active drug controls. We
      performed a MEDLARS search using the MeSH heading "hypertension" and the text
      word "nifedipine" to identify all articles that were published between 1966 and
      August 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages and that
      involved human subjects. The computerized search was supplemented by a manual
      search of article bibliographies. Review of 1880 citations revealed 98 randomized
      controlled clinical trials that met protocol criteria. Articles were extracted
      independently by two doctors who were blinded for author, institution, and
      treatment regimen, using a structured, pretested extraction form. Differences of 
      opinion were resolved by consensus. Fourteen events occurred in 5198 exposures
      (0.27%) to nifedipine and 24 events in 5402 exposures (0.44%) to other active
      drug controls. Unadjusted odds ratios for nifedipine versus controls were 0.49
      (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-1.09) for definitive events (death, nonfatal 
      myocardial infarction or stroke, revascularization procedure) and 0.61 (95% CI,
      0.31-1.17) for all events (definitive plus increased angina). The odds ratio for 
      nifedipine monotherapy (sustained- or extended-release in 91% of exposures) was
      nonsignificantly higher for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 
      0.49-4.03 and odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.59-3.32, respectively). The odds ratio 
      for nifedipine in combination with another drug was significantly lower for
      definitive and all events (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.66 and odds ratio,
      0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.65, respectively). Differences in odds ratio for nifedipine 
      monotherapy and combined therapy were statistically significant (P=.02 for
      definitive events and P=.001 for all events). Results support the safety of
      sustained- and extended-release nifedipine in the treatment of mild or moderate
      hypertension when it is used in combination with other drugs.

TI  - Cancer risk in users of calcium channel blockers.
PG  - 1091-4
AB  - Ca2+ channel blockers may cause cancer by inhibiting apoptosis or reducing
      intracellular Ca2+ in certain tissues. Recent findings suggest that drug users
      are at increased risk for cancer in general and for colon cancer in particular.
      We conducted a study in one Danish county of 17911 patients who received at least
      one prescription of Ca2+ channel blockers between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 
      1993. The patients were identified from records in the National Health Insurance 
      Program, which refunds part of the price of such drugs. Cancer occurrence and
      rate were determined by use of the files of the Danish Cancer Registry and
      compared with county-specific incidence rates for various categories of cancer.
      During the follow-up period of up to 3 years, 412 cancers were observed among
      users of Ca2+ channel blockers, compared with 414 expected, to yield an age- and 
      sex-standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.90 to 
      1.10). There was no indication of an excess risk in the subgroup of likely
      long-term users or users of specific drugs. The SIR of colon cancer, a site of a 
      priori interest, was 0.8 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.1) on the basis of 34
      cases. Although the results are reassuring, the lack of association could reflect
      the relatively short follow-up after registration in the prescription database.
      Continued monitoring of cancer risk is planned.

TI  - Relationships of quality-of-life measures to long-term lifestyle and drug
      treatment in the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study.
PG  - 638-48
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare 5 antihypertensive drugs and placebo for changes in
      quality of life (QL). To assess the relationship of lifestyle factors and change 
      in lifestyle factors to QL in participants with stage I diastolic hypertension.
      METHODS: The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) was a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with minimum participant
      follow-up of 4 years. It was conducted at 4 hypertension screening and treatment 
      academic centers in the United States. The cohort consisted of 902 men and women 
      with hypertension, aged 45 to 69 years, with diastolic blood pressures less than 
      100 mm Hg. Informed consent was obtained from each participant after the nature
      of the procedures had been fully explained. Sustained nutritional-hygienic
      intervention was administered to all participants to reduce weight, to reduce
      dietary sodium and alcohol intake, and to increase physical activity.
      Participants were randomized to take (1) acebutolol (n = 132); (2) amlodipine
      maleate (n = 131); (3) chlorthalidone (n = 126); (4) doxazosin mesylate (n =
      134); (5) enalapril maleate (n = 135); or placebo (n = 234). Changes in 7 QL
      indexes were assessed based on a 35-item questionnaire: (1) general health; (2)
      energy or fatigue; (3) mental health; (4) general functioning; (5) satisfaction
      with physical abilities; (6) social functioning; and (7) social contacts.
      RESULTS: At baseline, higher QL was associated with older age, more physical
      activity, lower obesity level, male gender, non-African American race, and higher
      educational level. Improvements in QL were observed in all randomized groups,
      including the placebo group during follow-up; greater improvements were observed 
      in the acebutolol and chlorthalidone groups and were evident throughout
      follow-up. The amount of weight loss, increase in physical activity, and level of
      attained blood pressure control during follow-up were related to greater
      improvements in QL. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stage I hypertension,
      antihypertensive treatment with any of 5 agents used in TOMHS does not impair QL.
      The diuretic chlorthali-done and the cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol
      appear to improve QL the most. Success with lifestyle changes affecting weight
      loss and increase in physical activity relate to greater improvements in QL and
      show that these interventions, in addition to contributing to blood pressure
      control, have positive effects on the general well-being of the individual.

TI  - Cardiac event rates after acute myocardial infarction in patients treated with
      verapamil and trandolapril versus trandolapril alone. Danish Verapamil Infarction
      Trial (DAVIT) Study Group.
PG  - 738-41
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve survival in patients with 
      congestive heart failure (CHF) after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but
      mortality may be as high as 10% to 15% after 1 year. Verapamil prevents cardiac
      events after an AMI in patients without CHF. We hypothesized that in postinfarct 
      patients with CHF already prescribed diuretics and an ACE inhibitor, additional
      treatment with verapamil may reduce cardiac event rate. In this multicenter,
      double-blind study, patients with CHF receiving diuretic treatment were
      consecutively randomized to treatment with trandolapril 1 mg/day for 1 month and 
      2 mg/day the following 2 months (n = 49), or to trandolapril as mentioned plus
      verapamil 240 mg/day for 1 month and 360 mg/day for 2 months (n = 51). Trial
      medication started 3 to 10 days after AMI. All patients were followed for 3
      months. End points in the trandolapril/trandolapril-verapamil groups were death
      1/1, reinfarction 7/1, unstable angina 9/3, and readmission for CHF 6/2. The
      3-month first cardiac event rate was 35% in trandolapril-treated patients and 14%
      in trandolapril-verapamil-treated patients (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% confidence
      interval 0.15 to 0.85, p = 0.015). These data suggest that verapamil reduces
      cardiac event rates in post-AMI patients with CHF when added to an ACE inhibitor 
      and a diuretic.

TI  - Carvedilol versus verapamil in chronic stable angina: a multicentre trial.
PG  - 95-100
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group study, the anti-anginal
      and the anti-ischaemic efficacy of 12 weeks of therapy with the vasodilating
      beta-adrenoceptor-blocker carvedilol 25 mg b.i.d. was compared with verapamil 120
      mg t.i.d. METHODS: During a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were required 
      to have two treadmill exercise tests (modified Bruce Protocol) differing by not
      more than 15% with regard to total exercise time (TET). Of 313 patients enrolled,
      248 were randomized and 212 completed the study according to the protocol.
      RESULTS: The primary variable TET was analysed using the Cox Proportional Hazards
      Model to take into account censored values due to the patient stopping the
      exercise test for reasons other than angina. Forty-three per cent of patients
      allocated to carvedilol and 36% to verapamil did not stop with angina at the
      final visit. There was no difference in the TET between the groups, the risk
      ratio being 1.14 in favour of carvedilol (90% CI 0.85-1.52). TET increased from
      378 s at baseline to 436 s at the final visit in the carvedilol group and from
      386 to 438 s in the verapamil group. Results for time to angina and time to 1 mm 
      ST-segment depression were similar. Compared to verapamil, carvedilol
      significantly reduced HR, systolic BP and rate pressure product at peak exercise.
      Analysis of 48 h Holter monitor data showed a greater reduction of HR and PVCs
      with carvedilol. Lown grading improved in both groups. Adverse events were
      reported by 48% (3.2% serious adverse events) of patients taking carvedilol and
      58% (5.7% serious adverse events) taking verapamil. CONCLUSION: Carvedilol is at 
      least as effective as verapamil in the management of chronic stable angina and
      demonstrated a favourable adverse event profile.

TI  - Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in NIDDM (ABCD) Trial.
PG  - 1646-54
AB  - The ABCD (Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes) Trial is a large,
      prospective, randomized clinical trial of 950 patients with non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) designed to compare the effects of intensive blood
      pressure control with moderate control on the prevention and progression of
      diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and neuropathy in
      NIDDM. The secondary objective is to determine equivalency of the effects of a
      calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine) and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme
      inhibitor (enalapril) as a first-line antihypertensive agent in the prevention
      and/or progression of these diabetic vascular complications. The study consists
      of two study populations aged 40-74 years, 470 hypertensive patients (diastolic
      blood pressure of > or = 90.0 mmHg at time of randomization) and 480 normotensive
      patients (diastolic blood pressure of 80.0 mmHg at time of randomization). The
      study duration is 5 years and is scheduled to end in May of 1998. Patients are
      randomized to receive either intensive antihypertensive drug therapy or moderate 
      antihypertensive drug therapy. Patients are also randomized to nisoldipine or
      enalapril, with open-label medications added if further blood pressure control is
      necessary. The primary outcome measure is glomerular filtration rate as assessed 
      by 24-h creatinine clearance. Secondary outcome measures are urinary albumin
      excretion, left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.
      Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality will also be evaluated. Given the data
      showing the impact of hypertension on complications in NIDDM, the ABCD Trial is
      designed to determine if intensive antihypertensive therapy will be more
      efficacious than moderate antihypertensive therapy on the outcome of diabetic
      complications in NIDDM.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine on morbidity and mortality in severe chronic heart failure. 
      Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation Study Group.
PG  - 1107-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that calcium-channel blockers increase
      morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. We studied the
      effect of a new calcium-channel blocker, amlodipine, in patients with severe
      chronic heart failure. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1153 patients with severe
      chronic heart failure and ejection fractions of less than 30 percent to
      double-blind treatment with either placebo (582 patients) or amlodipine (571
      patients) for 6 to 33 months, while their usual therapy was continued. The
      randomization was stratified on the basis of whether patients had ischemic or
      nonischemic causes of heart failure. The primary end point of the study was death
      from any cause and hospitalization for major cardiovascular events. RESULTS:
      Primary end points were reached in 42 percent of the placebo group and 39 percent
      of the amlodipine group, representing a 9 percent reduction in the combined risk 
      of fatal and nonfatal events with amlodipine (95 percent confidence interval, 24 
      percent reduction to 10 percent increase; P=0.31). A total of 38 percent of the
      patients in the placebo group died, as compared with 33 percent of those in the
      amlodipine group, representing a 16 percent reduction in the risk of death with
      amlodipine (95 percent confidence interval, 31 percent reduction to 2 percent
      increase; P=0.07). Among patients with ischemic heart disease, there was no
      difference between the amlodipine and placebo groups in the occurrence of either 
      end point. In contrast, among patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy,
      amlodipine reduced the combined risk of fatal and nonfatal events by 31 percent
      (P=0.04) and decreased the risk of death by 46 percent (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Amlodipine did not increase cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in patients
      with severe heart failure. The possibility that amlodipine prolongs survival in
      patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy requires further study.

TI  - Comparison of the therapeutic effects of the beta-blocking agent bisoprolol and
      the calcium-blocking agent diltiazem in patients with heart failure due to
      dilated cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 767-73
AB  - Beta-blocking agents reduce mortality and improve symptoms in patients with
      dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). There have been reports that diltiazem, a
      calcium-blocking agent, is also effective in such patients. We prospectively
      compared the effects of the beta-blocking agent bisoprolol with those of the
      calcium-blocking agent diltiazem in 18 patients (11 males and 7 females, age 14
      to 68) with DCM. The 18 patients, (10 in New York Heart Association functional
      class III and 8 in class IV) were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Bisoprolol was
      administered as the first drug in 10 patients and diltiazem was administered in
      8. Cross-over to bisoprolol was also performed in 3 patients. At the end of the
      study, among the 13 patients who had been given bisoprolol, 9 showed a good
      response (efficacy rate: 69%). In contrast, only 3 of the 8 patients who received
      diltiazem showed a good response (efficacy rate: 37.5%). Among the patients in
      NYHA class III, all 7 (100%) who were treated with bisoprolol responded but only 
      2 of the 4 (50%) treated with diltiazem responded (p < 0.05). Among the patients 
      in class IV, 2 of 6 (33%) responded to bisoprolol and 1 of 4 (25%) responded to
      diltiazem (not significant). These results suggest that diltiazem, like
      bisoprolol, has a beneficial effect in patients with DCM, with a greater effect
      in class III patients. However, we conclude that diltiazem should usually be used
      as a second choice to improve heart failure in DCM, and as the first medication
      only in those with contraindications to beta-blocking agents.

TI  - Low dosages of felodipine ER once daily as monotherapy in elderly hypertensive
      patients: effect on ambulatory blood pressure and quality of life.
PG  - 613-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the efficacy of 24-h ambulatory and casual blood pressure
      (BP) reduction, and the tolerability of once daily felodipine extended release
      (ER) 2.5 mg and felodipine ER 5 mg as monotherapy. DESIGN: Randomised,
      double-blind placebo controlled 6 weeks parallel study. SETTING: From 15 general 
      practices centres (with 19 GPs) in the region of the University of Maastricht,
      The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: A total of 129 subjects aged 50-80 years with primary 
      hypertension were screened; 27 men and 61 women with a casual diastolic BP of
      100-115 mm Hg and/or a systolic BP of less than 200 mm Hg entered the study. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Casual and 24-h ambulatory BP and a subjective symptom
      assessment (SSA) questionnaire after 6 weeks of therapy. RESULTS: After
      correlation for placebo response the mean casual systolic/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) 
      reduction was 10/5 mm Hg (NS) and 12/10 mm Hg (P < 0.05) for felodipine ER 2.5
      and 5 mg, respectively. By using 24-h ambulatory BP measurements these reduction 
      were 6/4 mm Hg (NS) and 13/8 mm Hg (P < 0.05), respectively. No significant
      difference for SBP and DBP was found during the night time between felodipine 2.5
      and placebo (-1/0). Felodipine ER 5 mg lowered the BP load significantly during
      both daytime and night time but felodipine ER 2.5 mg only for DBP during the
      daytime. There was a significant difference for the number of responders between 
      placebo (28%) vs felodipine ER 2.5 mg (55%) and ER 5.0 mg (59%). Both felodipine 
      dosages and placebo were comparable in (a low) number of adverse events and
      results of the SSA. CONCLUSIONS: During daytime felodipine ER 2.5 mg and 5 mg are
      effective in BP lowering in elderly hypertensive patients. However, only
      felodipine ER mg is effective in reducing BP during night time (22.00-7.00). Only
      felodipine ER 5 mg has a significant reducing effect on BP load during day and
      night time. Both felodipine ER 2.5 and ER 5.0 have a significant effect on the
      responder rate. It appeared from this study that compared to placebo, and in
      contrast with felodipine ER 5 mg, the ER form of felodipine 2.5 mg has no BP
      lowering effect during night time in elderly patients. To assess the effectivity 
      during night time of felodipine ER 2.5 mg in an individual patient it is
      recommendable to measure the BP at the end of the dose interval.

TI  - Antihypertensive therapy and quality of life. Influence of blood pressure
      reduction, adverse events, and prior antihypertensive therapy.
PG  - 854-9
AB  - Quality of life is an important attribute of antihypertensive therapy. Previous
      studies have not addressed the importance of a patient's prior pharmacotherapy on
      quality of life, which may serve as the basis of reference for a new therapy. Nor
      have previous studies compared commonly used quality of life instruments for
      consistency, or investigated whether improvement or worsening of quality of life 
      correlates with adverse events or blood pressure reduction. Two hundred eighteen 
      hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure (95 to 114 mm Hg) after a 4- 
      to 5-week placebo washout period were enrolled in a randomized double-blind,
      parallel group dose-escalation trial to compare the effects of amlodipine (2.5 to
      10 mg), bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg)/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 6.25, and enalapril 
      (5 to 20 mg) on blood pressure, adverse events, and quality of life. Three
      quality of life instruments (General Well-Being Index, Vital Signs Quality of
      Life, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) were administered during original
      therapy, after placebo washout, and after 12 weeks of optimally titrated clinical
      trial pharmacotherapy. Our results demonstrated that removal from prior therapy
      had no detectable influence on subsequent evaluation of quality of life. The
      three quality of life instruments were consistent with the changes observed with 
      the three therapies: a trend toward better quality of life with amlodipine and
      bisoprolol/HCTZ. Adverse events, but not systolic or diastolic blood pressure
      reduction correlated directly with changes in quality of life.

TI  - Calcium-channel blockade and incidence of cancer in aged populations.
PG  - 493-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium-channel blockers can alter apoptosis, a mechanism for
      destruction of cancer cells. We examined whether the long-term use of
      calcium-channel blockers is associated with an increased risk of cancer. METHODS:
      Between 1988 and 1992 we carried out a prospective cohort study of 5052 people
      aged 71 years or more and who lived in three regions of Massachusetts, Iowa, and 
      Connecticut USA. Those taking calcium-channel blockers (n = 451) were compared
      with all other participants (n = 4601). The incidence of cancer was assessed by
      survey of hospital discharge diagnoses and causes of death. These outcomes were
      validated by the cancer registry in the one region where it was available.
      Demographic variables, disability, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, blood 
      pressure, body-mass index, use of other drugs, hospital admissions for other
      causes, and comorbidity were all assessed as possible confounding factors.
      FINDINGS: The hazard ratio for cancer associated with calcium-channel blockers
      (1549 person-years, 47 events) compared with those not taking calcium-channel
      blockers (17225 person-years, 373 events) was 1.72 (95% CI 1.27-2.34, p =
      0.0005), after adjustment for confounding factors. A significant dose-response
      gradient was found. Hazard ratios associated with verapamil, diltiazem, and
      nifedipine did not differ significantly from each other. The results remained
      unchanged in community-specific analyses. The association between calcium-channel
      blockers and cancer was found with most of the common cancers. INTERPRETATION:
      Calcium-channel blockers were associated with a general increased risk of cancer 
      in the study populations, which suggested a common mechanism. These observational
      findings should be confirmed by other studies.

TI  - Diltiazem improves cardiac function and exercise capacity in patients with
      idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Results of the Diltiazem in Dilated
      Cardiomyopathy Trial.
PG  - 346-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence is arising that calcium antagonists in idiopathic dilated
      cardiomyopathy (IDC) may have beneficial effects on virus-induced
      cardiopathology, alcohol toxicity, micro-circulatory disorders, and impaired
      calcium cycling, all possibly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, 
      the effect of adjunct diltiazem (60 to 90 mg TID) on standard treatment was
      investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Diltiazem in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DiDi)
      trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of
      186 patients (92 receiving diltiazem, 94 receiving placebo) with IDC diagnosed by
      coronary angiography, catheterization of the left side of the heart, and a left
      ventricular ejection fraction of < 0.50 (mean, 0.34 +/- 0.11). The effect of
      adjunct diltiazem treatment on transplant listing-free survival, hemodynamics,
      exercise capacity, and subjective status was investigated. During the 24-month
      study period, 33 patients dropped out of the study; 153 patients finished the
      study protocol. Twenty-seven patients died or had a listing for heart
      transplantation: 16 in the placebo group and 11 in the diltiazem group. The
      transplant listing-free survival rate was 85% for diltiazem and 80% for placebo
      recipients (P = .444). After 24 months, only diltiazem significantly increased
      cardiac index at rest (P = .01) and under a workload (P = .02), systolic and
      diastolic pressures (P = .003 and P = .004), stroke volume index (P = .003), and 
      stroke work index (P = .000) and decreased both pulmonary artery pressure under
      workload (P = .007) and heart rate (P = .001). Diltiazem also increased exercise 
      capacity (P = .002) and subjective well-being (P = .01). Adverse reactions were
      minor and evenly distributed in both groups, except for an increase in the PQ
      interval in the diltiazem group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IDC, the adjunct
      therapy of diltiazem improves cardiac function, exercise capacity, and subjective
      status without deleterious effects on transplant listing-free survival.

TI  - Age and severe adverse drug reactions caused by nifedipine and verapamil. Gruppo 
      Italiano di Farmacovigilanza nell' Anziano (GIFA).
PG  - 921-8
AB  - The association of age with risk for severe adverse drug reactions (SADRs) was
      studied in 2371 and 862 hospitalized patients taking nifedipine and verapamil,
      respectively. Nifedipine caused hypotension (n = 22), tachycardia (n = 3), and
      acute renal failure (n = 1) (total SADR rate, 1.1%, 26/2371). Verapamil caused
      hypotension (n = 3), bradycardia (n = 9), and atrioventricular blocks (n = 2)
      (total SADR rate, 1.6%, 14/862). The mean age of patients with and without SADRs 
      was for nifedipine 77.1 +/- 1.7 and 71.8 +/- 0.8 years, respectively (p < 0.05), 
      and for verapamil 73.4 +/- 2.9 and 73.1 +/- 0.4 years, respectively. Sex, length 
      of stay, comorbidity, polypharmacy, intake of slow-release preparations, daily
      dosage, and new intake of calcium antagonists were examined as potential
      confounders of the age-SADR association. After adjusting for potential
      confounders, age was significantly and independently associated with SADRs caused
      by nifedipine, but not with SADRs caused by verapamil (OR = 1.69, 95% CI =
      1.05-2.72 and OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.63-1.68 for 10-year increase, respectively). 
      Although nifedipine and verapamil did not have significantly different rates of
      SADRs, an age-related gradient was found only for nifedipine.

TI  - Comparison of enalapril versus nifedipine to decrease left ventricular
      hypertrophy in systemic hypertension (the PRESERVE trial).
PG  - 61-5
AB  - The PRESERVE (Prospective Randomized Enalapril Study Evaluating Regression of
      Ventricular Enlargement) study is designed to provide a definitive test of the
      ability of enalapril to achieve greater left ventricular (LV) mass reduction than
      nifedipine GITs (gastrointestinal treatment system) by a degree that would be
      prognostically meaningful on a population basis (10 g/m2). To achieve this goal, 
      an ethnically diverse population of 480 men and women with essential hypertension
      and increased LV mass of screening echocardiography will be enrolled at clinical 
      centers on 4 continents and studied by echocardiography at baseline and after 6
      and 12 months' randomized therapy. Blinded readings of echocardiograms at a
      central laboratory will provide systematic information about treatment effects on
      LV structure, wall motion, and Doppler blood flow. The study power is at least
      90% to test the primary hypotheses that enalapril will induce greater
      normalization of LV mass and diastolic filling than nifedipine. After the 1-year 
      echocardiographic trial, the study population will be followed 3 more years to
      test the hypothesis that a reduction in LV mass, independent of blood pressure
      lowering, is associated with a reduction in the risk of morbid and fatal
      cardiovascular events.

TI  - Rationale and design of the third vasodilator-heart failure trial (V-HeFT III):
      felodipine as adjunctive therapy to enalapril and loop diuretics with or without 
      digoxin in chronic congestive heart failure. V-HeFT III investigators.
PG  - 1078-82
AB  - Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nonselective
      vasodilators (hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate) has become accepted treatment
      in patients with symptomatic, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), and has
      been demonstrated in large clinical trials to ameliorate symptoms, improve
      exercise performance, and reduce cardiac mortality. Nevertheless, the management 
      of patients with CHF remains a therapeutic challenge. The second
      Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT II) showed that the average 2-year
      mortality with enalapril (18%) was significantly lower than that with
      hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (25%) but, somewhat surprisingly, the
      nonspecific vasodilators produced significantly more improvement in exercise
      performance and left ventricular function. Such data suggest that improvement in 
      symptoms, hemodynamics, and survival may not be afforded by the use of a single
      class of vasodilator therapy, but might be optimized by the combined use of
      different agents. This report describes the rationale and design of V-HeFT III, a
      multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
      comparing the effects of chronic oral extended-release felodipine (felodipine ER)
      2.5 to 5 mg twice daily, when added to a stable regimen of enalapril and loop
      diuretics, with or without digoxin, on exercise performance, morbidity, and
      mortality in patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to III 
      CHF followed for a minimum of 12 weeks. Felodipine is a second-generation
      dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of vascular selectivity
      which, in the doses used in this study, exerts its systemic arterial effect by
      decreasing peripheral vascular resistance without producing negative inotropic
      effects. The results of V-HeFT III may shed important light on the role of
      additive vasodilator therapy in the management of patients with CHF.

TI  - Does high salt intake cause hyperfiltration in patients with essential
      hypertension?
PG  - 157-61
AB  - In animal models of salt-dependent hypertension, hyperfiltration is associated
      with a faster decline in renal function and there is evidence that in
      hypertensive man, increased creatinine clearance is a marker of early
      hypertensive nephropathy. We have studied the influence of salt intake on the
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (Creatinine Clearance) in 14 patients with mild 
      hypertension. Each patient was studied in random order and according to a
      crossover design, at habitual salt intake, at high salt intake (ie habitual
      +50/100 mmol/day) and at low salt intake (habitual -50/100 mmol/day). Protein,
      calcium and potassium intake was fixed across the three study periods. The
      control group was formed by seven healthy subjects. High salt intake, caused a
      significant (P < 0.01) increase in 24 h mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the
      expected suppression in plasma renin activity (PRA) and in plasma aldosterone.
      Seven patients were classified as salt-sensitive. The GFR was significantly
      higher (P < 0.01) at high salt intake (125 +/- 10 ml/min) than at habitual (113
      +/- 7 ml/min) and at low salt intake (97 +/- 6 ml/min). On aggregate urinary salt
      excretion was significantly related with the GFR (P < 0.01 by correlation
      analysis for repeated observations) and the slope of this relationship predicted 
      that a 100 mmol/day increase in salt intake is associated with the 14.6 ml/min
      rise in the GFR. The relationship between GFR and 24 h urinary salt in salt
      sensitive patients did not differ from that in salt resistant patients. The GFR
      response to salt loading was largely independent of the renin-aldosterone system.
      No change in arterial pressure nor in GFR was observed in healthy subjects. At
      fixed protein intake, changes in salt intake in the physiological range are
      associated with important GFR variations in mild hypertensives. As long as
      hyperfiltration in mild hypertension is a predictor of renal function
      deterioration, high salt intake, independent of the effect of arterial pressure, 
      could be a factor that contributes to nephronic obsolescence in patients with
      essential hypertension.

TI  - Quality of life in normotensives compared to hypertensive men treated with
      isradipine or methyldopa as monotherapy or in combination with captopril: the
      LOMIR-MCT-IL study.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - Quality of life (QOL) measures were assessed in a multi-center, double-blind,
      case-controlled trial of 1 year's duration. A total of 368 hypertensive male
      patients were randomly assigned to monotherapies of either isradipine, methyldopa
      or placebo. If normotension was not achieved, captopril was added. QOL
      assessments in the hypertensives and in 155 normotensives included a
      self-structured scale to measure the subjective perception of QOL, the severity, 
      desirability and controllability of recent critical life events, semantic memory,
      physical dysfunction, sleep disorders, sexual difficulties, depression and
      work-related stress. The overall withdrawal rate during the trial was 19%, mainly
      due to lack of efficacy and adverse experiences. At baseline, and at the end of
      the trial, the normotensives as compared to hypertensive patients, had
      significantly better scores in most QOL measures. Patients treated with the
      combination of isradipine and captopril reported more favorable changes in the
      subjective measure of QOL (P < 0.03) and in semantic memory (P < 0.001) than
      patients treated with any of the monotherapies or with methyldopa in combination 
      with captopril. There were no statistically significant differences among
      treatments for changes of other indices of QOL. In most QOL measurements,
      normotensives rated better then hypertensives. Patients treated on long-term
      therapy with the combination of isradipine and captopril showed improvement in
      self-structured QOL measures and semantic memory, compared to patients treated
      either with methyldopa or placebo.

TI  - Acute hemodynamic and long-term clinical effects of isradipine in patients with
      coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure. A double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 37-43
AB  - To assess the acute hemodynamic and long-term clinical effects of isradipine, a
      calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine class, we performed a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled parallel study in 19 patients with coronary artery disease
      (CAD) and stable chronic heart failure (CHF). Their mean age was 56 +/- 5 years, 
      and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.18 +/- 0.05. Patients were
      treated with diuretics and digoxin only. All were clinically stable and in sinus 
      rhythm. The acute hemodynamic study showed that (intravenous) isradipine
      increased cardiac index (+36%) and stroke volume index (+30%) (both P < 0.001),
      while systemic vascular resistance (-33%) and mean arterial pressure (-10%)
      decreased (both P < 0.005). Filling pressures and heart rate were not affected.
      Of the 19 patients, 17 completed the 12 week study; 2 patients on placebo (1
      death, 1 side-effects) but no patient on isradipine (5 mg 3 times daily) dropped 
      out. After 12 weeks, peak oxygen consumption (VO2), LVEF, echocardiographic
      indices, and other clinical parameters were unaffected by treatment. Repeat
      invasive hemodynamic measurements showed that the initial improvement by
      isradipine was not present anymore. In conclusion, despite a beneficial acute
      hemodynamic effect, isradipine has no favorable clinical influence during
      prolonged treatment in patients with mild to moderate CHF.

TI  - Long-term prevention of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery:
      comparison of quinidine, verapamil, and amiodarone in maintaining sinus rhythm.
PG  - 61-4
AB  - AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate the necessity and efficacy of quinidine fumarate,
      verapimil, or amiodarone prophylaxis for sinus rhythm maintenance in patients who
      experienced atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery. METHODS:
      Between 1992 and 1995, this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study
      examined 120 patients in whom atrial fibrillation occurred and was restored to
      sinus rhythm by pharmacological therapy or direct current cardioversion in the
      immediately postoperative period after coronary artery by-pass surgery. There
      were no significant differences in perioperative characteristics among the
      patients, who were randomly separated into four groups in the course of
      discharge. In group 1 (n = 30), patients did not receive antiarrhythmic drugs.
      Quinidine fumarate was given in group 2 (n = 30), verapimil in group 3 (n = 30), 
      and amiodarone in group 4 (n = 30). Patients were monitored six times over a
      90-day postoperative period by 24-hour Holter monitoring and routine examination.
      RESULTS: The recurrent atrial fibrillation usually developed within 15 days of
      discharge. Atrial fibrillation occurred in one patient (3.33%) in group 1, and
      two each (6.66%) in groups 2, 3, and 4. Atrial fibrillation was asymptomatic and 
      occurred with slow ventricular response in groups 3 and 4. Side effects occurred 
      in 5 patients (16.6%) given quinidine, 1 patient given amiodarone, but in no
      patient given verapimil. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in
      the maintenance of sinus rhythm among the four groups, so we suggest that
      long-term prevention of atrial fibrillation in patients with coronary artery
      bypass grafting was not necessary at the postdischarge period.

TI  - Effects of metoprolol vs verapamil in patients with stable angina pectoris. The
      Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm (APSIS)
PG  - 76-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study long-term treatment effects of metoprolol or verapamil on
      combined cardiovascular end points and psychological variables in patients with
      stable angina pectoris. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial.
      PATIENTS: The study included 809 patients under 70 years of age with stable
      angina pectoris. The mean age of the patients was 59 +/- 7 years and 31% were
      women. Exclusion criteria were myocardial infarction within the previous 3 years 
      and contraindications to beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. The patients were
      followed between 6 and 75 months (median 3.4 years and a total of 2887 patient
      years). INTERVENTION: The patients were treated with either metoprolol (Seloken
      ZOC 200 mg o.d.) or verapamil (Isoptin Retard 240 b.i.d.). Acetylsalicylic acid, 
      ACE inhibitors, lipid lowering drugs and long acting nitrates were allowed in the
      study. END POINTS: Death, non-fatal cardiovascular events including acute
      myocardial infarction, incapacitating or unstable angina, cerebrovascular or
      peripheral vascular events. Psychological variables reflecting quality of life
      i.e. psychosomatic symptoms, sleep disturbances and an evaluation of overall life
      satisfaction. RESULTS: Combined cardiovascular events did not differ and occurred
      in 30.8% and 29.3% of metoprolol and verapamil treated patients respectively.
      Total mortality in metoprolol and verapamil treated patients was 5.4 and 6.2%,
      respectively. Cardiovascular mortality was 4.7% in both groups. Non-fatal
      cardiovascular events occurred in 26.1 and 24.3% of metoprolol and
      verapamil-treated patients, respectively. Psychosomatic symptoms and sleep
      disturbances were significantly improved in both treatment groups. The magnitudes
      of change were small and did not differ between treatments. Life satisfaction did
      not change on either drug. Withdrawals due to side effects occurred in 11.1 and
      14.6% respectively. CONCLUSION: This long term study indicates that both drugs
      are well tolerated and that no difference was shown on the effect on mortality,
      cardiovascular end points and measures of quality of life.

PG  - 104-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between presence or absence of ischaemic
      events on Holter monitoring and occurrence of a hard or hard+soft endpoint.
      DESIGN: A randomized double-blind parallel group study of atenolol, nifedipine
      and their combination, with ambulatory monitoring off-treatment and after 6 weeks
      of randomized treatment and prospective follow-up of 2 years on average. SETTING:
      Europe. SUBJECTS: 682 men and women with a diagnosis of chronic stable angina and
      who were not being considered for surgery. MAIN OUTCOME: Hard endpoints were
      cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and unstable angina; soft endpoints
      were coronary artery bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty and treatment failure. 
      RESULTS: The study showed no evidence of an association between the presence,
      frequency or total duration of ischaemic events on Holter monitoring, either on
      or off treatment, and the main outcome measures. There was a non-significant
      trend to a lower rate of hard endpoints in the group receiving combination
      therapy. Compliance, as measured by withdrawal from trial medication, was clearly
      poorest in the nifedipine group with similar withdrawal rates in the atenolol and
      combination therapy groups. CONCLUSION: The recording of ischaemic events in 48 h
      Holter monitoring failed to predict hard or hard+soft endpoints in patients with 
      chronic stable angina.

TI  - Comparison of effects on peak oxygen consumption, quality of life, and
      neurohormones of felodipine and enalapril in patients with congestive heart
      failure.
PG  - 1253-8
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is currently the cornerstone of
      congestive heart failure (CHF) therapy, but these drugs are not tolerated in up
      to 20% of patients. For these patients, therapeutic alternatives with comparable 
      efficacy are needed. Felodipine, a vasoselective dihydropyridine calcium
      antagonist with a slow onset of action and a long plasma half-life, may be such
      an agent. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of felodipine were examined and
      compared with enalapril using a double-blind design. We studied 46 patients with 
      a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.40, peak oxygen consumption < 20
      ml.min-1.kg-1, and symptoms of CHF despite therapy with diuretics and digoxin.
      After 16 weeks of therapy, there were no statistically significant differences in
      peak oxygen consumption (felodipine +1.6, enalapril +2.5 ml.min-1.kg-1) and
      exercise tolerance (felodipine +61 seconds, enalapril +64 seconds).
      Quality-of-life parameters were affected slightly better by felodipine than by
      enalapril. Plasma norepinephrine decreased by 143 pg.ml-1 with enalapril and by
      12 pg.ml-1 with felodipine (p < 0.20 between groups). Both drugs were generally
      well tolerated. These data suggest that felodipine and enalapril have comparable 
      effects on exercise parameters in patients with CHF. Neurohumoral activation was 
      not observed with either drug.

TI  - Comparative study of efficacy and safety of low-dose diltiazem or betaxolol in
      combination with digoxin to control ventricular rate in chronic atrial
      fibrillation: randomized crossover study.
PG  - 167-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination therapy of low-dose diltiazem or bexatolol with
      digoxin can be a useful adjunct for achieving heart rate control with minimal
      side effects. But there has not been a study including patients with impaired
      left ventricular function and evaluating whether the beneficial effects of
      medication will be maintained during a follow-up period. OBJECTIVES: The purpose 
      of this study was three-fold: (1) to compare the efficacy of digoxin with
      low-dose diltiazem and digoxin with low-dose betaxolol on randomized crossover
      study; (2) to evaluate whether the beneficial effects of medication will be
      maintained after 7 months; (3) to evaluate the safety of the combination therapy 
      in patients with impaired left ventricular function. METHODS: We did a
      prospective randomized crossover study in 35 patients with chronic atrial
      fibrillation (AF) including 15 patients with left ventricular dysfunction. After 
      enrollment, each patient was evaluated for heart rate, blood pressure,
      rate-pressure products, maximal exercise tolerance at rest and during
      symptom-limited treadmill test before medication, at 4 weeks after medication of 
      digoxin (0.125-0.5 mg daily) with diltiazem (90 mg twice daily), and at 4 weeks
      after digoxin with betaxolol (20 mg once daily). We performed 24-h ambulatory
      electrocardiogram (ECG) in 15 patients at the end of each phase of treatment. We 
      repeated symptom-limited treadmill test like above method in 15 patients at 7
      months of medication. RESULTS: (1) Ventricular rates were significantly reduced
      in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol therapy at rest and during exercise (67 +/- 3,
      135 +/- 5 (mean +/- S.E.M.) beats/min, respectively) in comparison to digoxin
      with low-dose diltiazem therapy (80 +/- 7, 154 +/- 5) (P < 0.05). (2)
      Rate-pressure products were significantly less in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol
      at rest and during exercise (85 +/- 4, 213 +/- 12 x 10(2) mmHg/min) than in
      digoxin with low-dose diltiazem therapy (105 +/- 6, 269 +/- 12) (P < 0.05). (3)
      Exercise capacity was significantly improved in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol
      (9.3 +/- 0.5 METS) or digoxin with low-dose diltiazem (9.7 +/- 0.5) in comparison
      to control state (8.3 +/- 0.5) (P < 0.05). (4) At 7 months evaluation, there was 
      no significant difference between at 4 weeks and at 7 months. (5) Results on 24-h
      ambulatory ECG showed the same findings as on treadmill test. (6) Although side
      effects occurred more frequently in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol therapy, they
      were minimal and no patient had to withdraw medication. Worsening of left
      ventricular dysfunction was not observed. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that
      (1) combination therapy of low-dose betaxolol with digoxin was more superior to
      low-dose diltiazem with digoxin in controlling ventricular rate and reducing
      rate-pressure products; (2) the effects controlling ventricular rate, reducing
      rate-pressure products and improving exercise capacity have been well maintained 
      even after 7 months of medication with each combination therapy.

TI  - Felodipine in addition to beta-adrenergic blockade for angina pectoris. a
      multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1535-41
AB  - The additional efficacy, duration of action and tolerability of felodipine were
      evaluated in patients with stable angina pectoris and a positive stress test who 
      were already receiving therapy with a beta-adrenergic blocker. One hundred and
      twenty-eight patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with 5-10 mg
      felodipine once daily or matching placebo, and were evaluated by serial exercise 
      testing during 12 weeks of treatment. Felodipine at 4 h significantly increased
      exercise duration assessed after 4 weeks of treatment (increase 34 +/- 65 s vs 18
      +/- 71 s in placebo-treated patients; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.11; P =
      0.01), and after 12 weeks of treatment (increase 39 +/- 103 s vs 3 +/- 72 s; 95% 
      confidence interval 1.01-1.16; P = 0.02). The time until onset of
      exercise-induced anginal pain and time until 1 mm ST depression assessed after 4 
      weeks of treatment also increased significantly with felodipine compared to
      placebo. No statistically significant changes in exercise test parameters
      evaluated 24 h after medication were observed. The addition of felodipine once
      daily demonstrated a sustained improvement in exercise duration in patients
      symptomatic despite treatment with a beta-blocker evaluated 4 h after drug
      intake. At 24 h post dose, no statistically significant effect was observed.
      Felodipine is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects and no adverse 
      effect on quality of life.

      field trial in general practice. The OCAPI Study Group. Optimiser le Choix d'un
      Anti-hypertenseur de Premiere Intention.
PG  - 1059-67
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the equivalence of four antihypertensive treatments in
      patients with mild-to- moderate hypertension, and to compare the effects of those
      drugs on the subjective quality of life and clinical safety. DESIGN, SETTING AND 
      PATIENTS: 653 patients aged > or = 18 years with untreated hypertension were
      randomly allocated to receive a combination of two diuretics (altizide and
      spironolactone), a beta-blocker (bisoprolol), a calcium antagonist (verapamil),
      or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril). Follow-up lasted
      for 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A composite outcome of the following measures 
      was used to define success: attendance at the 12-month visit; at least nine
      supine DBP measurements during the study; and median supine DBP < 90 mmHg and a
      reduction of at least 10 mmHg compared with the baseline value. Failure was
      defined as one or more of those criteria not being fulfilled. Equivalence was
      concluded if the 95% confidence interval for the success rates differed between
      two groups by less than +/- 10%. Clinical safety and subjective quality of life
      were also assessed. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in the
      change in DBP or systolic blood pressure were observed between the groups. The
      success rates were 43.9, 42.0, 32.5 and 43.9% in diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium 
      antagonist and ACE inhibitor groups, respectively. Equivalence between the
      treatments could not be concluded, although analysis with a larger equivalence
      interval showed that some comparisons indicated equivalence. Significant
      improvement in satisfaction was observed for certain items for subjective quality
      of life at 1 month in the calcium antagonist treatment group, and significant
      differences in the responses to the clinical safety questionnaire were observed
      after 1-month follow-up in calcium antagonist and beta-blocker groups.
      Differences were no longer significant after 9 months. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      do not provide evidence on the basis of efficacy of blood pressure lowering or
      ability to increase short-term (1-year) safety and quality of life favouring any 
      particular treatment among the studied drugs for newly diagnosed patients with
      mild-to-moderate hypertension.

TI  - Low-dose drug combination therapy: an alternative first-line approach to
      hypertension treatment.
PG  - 359-66
AB  - To investigate the concept that the initial treatment of hypertension with low
      doses of two antihypertensives that have different modes of action and additive
      effects may achieve control of blood pressure and minimize the dose-dependent
      adverse effects seen with conventional monotherapy, a randomized, double-blind
      parallel group dose-escalation study was conducted. After a 4 to 5 week placebo
      washout period, 218 men and women with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and
      114 mm Hg were randomly allocated to take: amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg), enalapril
      (5 to 20 mg), and the low-dose combination of bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg) with 6.25
      mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). All drugs were administered once daily,
      titrated to optimal response, and taken for a total of 12 weeks. Blood pressure
      was measured 24 hours after dose. The response rates (either a diastolic blood
      pressure < or = 90 mm Hg or a decrease of diastolic pressure > or = 10 mm Hg)
      were 71% for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, 69% for amlodipine, and 45% for enalapril. 
      The mean decreases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure from baseline were
      13.4/10.7, 12.8/10.2, and 7.3/6.6 mm Hg for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, amlodipine, 
      and enalapril, respectively. The mean change with enalapril was less than the
      other drugs (p < 0.01), although the once-daily dosing of enalapril and the
      maximum dose of 20 mg might not have been optimal for this agent.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Placebo controlled trial of felodipine in patients with mild to moderate heart
      failure. UK Study Group.
PG  - 428-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of felodipine and placebo in patients with New 
      York Heart Association functional class II or III and stable congestive heart
      failure despite treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor,
      diuretic, or digoxin, or any combination of these three drugs. PATIENTS AND
      DESIGN: 252 patients were randomised in a double blind, parallel group study
      after a 2-4 week placebo run-in to oral treatment with either felodipine extended
      release formulation or placebo 2.5-10 mg twice daily given in addition to
      existing background medication for a further 12 weeks. METHODS: Patients aged
      18-75 years of either sex with chronic congestive heart failure due to ischaemic 
      heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, or dilated cardiomyopathy with or
      without secondary mitral insufficiency that was stable during the preceding two
      months were included in the study. Treadmill exercise tests according to the
      modified Naughton protocol were performed at baseline, and after six, 11, and 12 
      weeks of treatment. Signs and symptoms of heart failure were assessed at every
      visit. Physical examination was performed and left ventricular ejection fraction 
      measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: Mean (SD) baseline exercise
      test times increased from 434 (162) s and 480 (157) s for felodipine and placebo 
      groups respectively to 541 (217) s and 591 (218) s at 12 weeks or the last visit.
      The change in exercise from baseline to last visit was 107 (141) s for patients
      given felodipine and 112 (128) s for those given placebo (P > 0.20). There was
      also no difference between treatments with respect to the other efficacy
      variables. There were few deaths in the study (felodipine n = 3, placebo n = 2). 
      More patients who received felodipine were withdrawn from treatment (n = 29) than
      those who received placebo (n = 17). The most common adverse events of the 54 and
      28 cited as reasons for withdrawal in the felodipine and placebo groups
      respectively were increased need for non-study heart failure treatment (n = 10;
      8%)--that is, starting new medication or changes in the dosage of existing
      treatment for patients given felodipine, and nausea (n = 4; 3%) for those given
      placebo. Patients withdrawn from the study due to increased need for non-study
      heart failure treatment rapidly stabilised and recovered. CONCLUSION: Felodipine 
      has not been shown to be of benefit in patients with mild to moderate heart
      failure.

      antagonists studied by prescription-event monitoring.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The incidence of vasodilation-related events (flushing, headache, dizziness and
      oedema) was determined in a total of 37,670 patients treated with diltiazem,
      nicardipine, isradipine or amlodipine and studied by Prescription-Event
      Monitoring between 1984 and 1991. Event rates are expressed as the percentage of 
      patients who experienced these events during the six months after the first
      prescription. The rates for all these events with the newer vasoselective
      dihydropyridines (nicardipine, isradipine and amlodipine) were higher than those 
      with diltiazem. Among the three dihydropyridines, there were large individual
      differences in the rates. With nicardipine, the frequency of each of the four
      vasodilation-related events were similar to one another (approximately 3%). With 
      isradipine, the rates were also similar to one another but all were approximately
      twice those measured in the nicardipine study (approximately 6%). These
      differences may have been due to confounding factors such as the publicity about 
      adverse drug reactions, the indication for use by individual patients or the
      doses actually being used at the time the event occurred. With amlodipine, in
      contrast, the rate for oedema was two to four times larger than the rates for
      flushing, headache or dizziness.

      multicentre study.
PG  - 23-30
AB  - The efficacy, tolerability and impact on quality of life of amlodipine and
      enalapril were compared in a multicentre, double-blind, general practice study in
      461 mild and moderate hypertensives over a 50-week active treatment period.
      Amlodipine (5-10 mg, once daily) and enalapril (10-40 mg, once daily) were found 
      to be similarly effective in lowering blood pressure while not adversely
      affecting quality-of-life parameters. However, 20% of the enalapril group
      compared with 11% of the amlodipine group required the addition of
      hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure control (P < 0.01). Diastolic blood
      pressure was normalised or reduced by 10 mmHg in 204 (90%) patients on amlodipine
      and in 190 (85%) patients on enalapril. Side-effects were, in general, mild or of
      little clinical significance. The major side-effects recorded were class-typical 
      of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, namely cough (enalapril) and oedema
      (amlodipine), respectively. Tolerability was very good, with only 17 patients (8 
      amlodipine, 4%; 9 enalapril, 4%) being withdrawn from the study due to
      side-effects definitely related to treatment. Amlodipine monotherapy produced a
      slightly beneficial effect on blood lipid concentration, and both drugs reduced
      the calculated 10-year risk of coronary heart disease. It was concluded that the 
      calcium antagonist amlodipine compared favourably with the ACE inhibitor
      enalapril in terms of antihypertensive efficacy, tolerability and impact on
      quality of life.

PG  - 329-39
AB  - The impact of antihypertensive medications on the quality of life of elderly
      hypertensive women has rarely been systematically evaluated in large clinical
      trials using drugs from the new generations of pharmaceutic preparations. We
      carried out a multicenter, randomized double-blind clinical trial with 309
      hypertensive women aged 60 to 80 years to assess effects of atenolol, enalapril, 
      and isradipine on measures of quality of life over a 22-week period. The patients
      had mild to moderate hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to treatment if 
      monotherapy was inadequate in lowering blood pressure. At the conclusion of the
      trial the three drug groups did not differ in degree of reduction of diastolic
      blood pressure or in supplementation with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the 22-week
      trial, linear trend analysis showed no differences between the treatment groups
      in change from baseline on quality of life measures of well-being, physical
      status, emotional status, cognitive functioning, and social role participation.
      Regarding each of 33 physical side effects over the 22 weeks, we found no general
      difference between atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine groups on measures of
      change in distress over symptoms except for enalapril patients who worsened in
      distress over cough (P = .001) and atenolol patients who worsened in distress
      over dry mouth (P = .014). Centering on three medications that are relatively new
      additions to the armamentarium for blood pressure control, the findings underline
      the increasing opportunities for the physician to select drugs that can control
      blood pressure while maintaining the quality of life of elderly hypertensive
      women.

TI  - Post-marketing surveillance of lisinopril in general practice in the UK.
PG  - 296-304
AB  - A total of 4676 patients and 1759 patients were treated with lisinopril and
      nifedipine respectively in a post-marketing surveillance study conducted in
      general practice in the UK. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Most of the 
      lisinopril patients had hypertension, but a small number (180) had heart failure.
      Most of the nifedipine patients had uncomplicated hypertension, but some (22.57%)
      had other cardiovascular disease with or without hypertension. Lisinopril and
      nifedipine were equally effective in reducing blood pressure. During the study,
      1.5% of hypertensive patients assigned to lisinopril died compared with 1.8% of
      patients assigned to nifedipine, and 15.1% of lisinopril patients compared with
      19.7% of patients in the nifedipine group withdrew because of adverse events.
      Cough, malaise and fatigue, nausea and vomiting were more frequent causes of
      withdrawal from lisinopril than nifedipine. Conversely, headaches, pallor and
      flushing, oedema and palpitations caused more frequent withdrawals from
      nifedipine. Anaemia was more often encountered on nifedipine treatment than on
      lisinopril. In hypertensive patients, the frequency of first-dose hypotension was
      similar on both treatments. Serious events occurred in 0.8% and 0.5% of patients 
      given lisinopril and nifedipine respectively. Lisinopril was well tolerated by
      heart failure patients: 16 patients (8.88%) died and an incidence of 4.44% of
      serious adverse events was reported, a pattern to be anticipated in such
      patients; dizziness, giddiness, dyspnoea, cough, nausea and vomiting were the
      most frequent causes of withdrawal; the incidence of first-dose hypotension was
      low (2.22%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - ALLHAT, or the soft science of the secondary end point.
PG  - 777-80
AB  - The recent Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack 
      Trial (ALLHAT) showed that the primary end point, coronary heart disease, was
      identical in the chlorthalidone, lisinopril, and amlodipine groups. Yet the major
      conclusion of this trial was that thiazide diuretics are superior in preventing 1
      or more major forms of cardiovascular disease and should be preferred for
      first-line antihypertensive therapy. This conclusion was based solely on an
      analysis of secondary end points and cost. As evidenced by the dictum to "use
      thiazides for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension" in the Seventh
      Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, 
      and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, this interpretation of ALLHAT broadly
      adumbrated these guidelines. Although diuretics will rightfully remain a
      cornerstone in antihypertensive therapy, we should remember (as we were told by
      the ALLHAT investigators) that secondary end points are "soft data" that should
      not form a basis for main conclusions or lead to a labeling of a drug class as
      preferred.

TI  - Medications and sexual function.
PG  - 553-62
AB  - There seems to be a reluctance to self-report sexual dysfunction during clinical 
      interviews. The rate of reported sexual dysfunction increases when information is
      sought aggressively in the clinical interview. The relationship to a specific
      therapeutic agent, however, can be clouded by the patient's perception and
      coexisting morbidity. Most of the data relating sexual dysfunction to specific
      drugs are anecdotal. The strongest proof of a casual effect is improvement in
      sexual function after withdrawal of the medication. Most of the adverse sexual
      effects of commonly used medications can be predicted from a simplified
      understanding of the human sexual response and physiologic mediators. Alternative
      therapeutic agents can be substituted by understanding these physiologic
      mechanisms and a careful clinical interview. Although polypharmacy is a problem
      for older persons, in some cases sildenafil can be used to correct drug-induced
      impotence.

TI  - Treatment of hypertension in older patients: an updated look at the role of
      calcium antagonists.
PG  - 319-27
AB  - Hypertension is common in adults aged 60 years or older. Apart from age,
      hypertension is the most powerful predictor of cardiovascular end-organ damage
      and its associated morbidity and mortality. Although diastolic blood pressure is 
      regarded as an important risk factor, it is now clear that systolic blood
      pressure, especially prevalent among older adults, is a better predictor of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Fewer than 30% of hypertensive patients
      have blood pressure levels controlled to <140/90 mm Hg as recommended by current 
      guidelines. Controlled trials have demonstrated the benefits of lowering blood
      pressure for all hypertensive individuals, including those aged 65 years or
      older. Calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine subclass, which include
      nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, and nitrendipine, as well as other drug
      classes, are potent antihypertensive agents that may be suitable for treatment of
      hypertension in older adults. However, as with all antihypertensive agents,
      adverse effects may limit their use; peripheral edema is particularly troublesome
      for dihydropyridines. Newer dihydropyridine calcium antagonists expected to be
      approved for use soon, including lercanidipine and lacidipine, have been
      associated with efficacy comparable to currently available calcium antagonists
      but with a lower incidence of adverse effects, especially ankle edema.
      Antihypertensive agents with improved tolerability profiles offer the potential
      for improved blood pressure control.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.
PG  - 181-92
AB  - Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are common disorders during pregnancy, 
      with the majority of cases developing at or near term. The development of mild
      hypertension or preeclampsia at or near term is associated with minimal maternal 
      and neonatal morbidities. In contrast, the onset of severe gestational
      hypertension and/or severe preeclampsia before 35 weeks' gestation is associated 
      with significant maternal and perinatal complications. Women with diagnosed
      gestational hypertension-preeclampsia require close evaluation of maternal and
      fetal conditions for the duration of pregnancy, and those with severe disease
      should be managed in-hospital. The decision between delivery and expectant
      management depends on fetal gestational age, fetal status, and severity of
      maternal condition at time of evaluation. Expectant management is possible in a
      select group of women with severe preeclampsia before 32 weeks' gestation.
      Steroids are effective in reducing neonatal mortality and morbidity when
      administered to those with severe disease between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation.
      Magnesium sulfate should be used during labor and for at least 24 hours
      postpartum to prevent seizures in all women with severe disease. There is an
      urgent need to conduct randomized trials to determine the efficacy and safety of 
      antihypertensive drugs in women with mild hypertension-preeclampsia. There is
      also a need to conduct a randomized trial to determine the benefits and risks of 
      magnesium sulfate during labor and postpartum in women with mild preeclampsia.

TI  - Has the role of calcium channel blockers in treating hypertension finally been
      defined?
PG  - 295-300
AB  - Several large, prospective, randomized, clinical outcome trials have shown that
      calcium channel blockers are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs compared
      with placebo and reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of treated
      patients. In other studies, when compared with conventional antihypertensive
      drugs, they demonstrated similar blood pressure-lowering effects and similar
      reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with the exception of a
      higher incidence of heart failure and fatal myocardial infarction in some
      studies. However, considering all the evidence available today, these drugs
      should be considered safe for the treatment of the uncomplicated hypertensive
      patient in combination with other drugs. They can also be used as first-line
      therapy for older, stroke-prone hypertensive patients. In addition, when a
      calcium channel blocker is indicated for better blood pressure control, its use
      should not be withheld for safety concerns.

TI  - Current treatment of patients with hypertension: therapeutic implications of
      INSIGHT.
PG  - 1435-44
AB  - When planning treatment for patients with hypertension, current guidelines
      emphasise the importance of risk stratification, based on blood pressure, the
      presence of end-organ damage and other cardiovascular risk factors. Because the
      beneficial effect of antihypertensive therapy seems to be linked to the degree of
      blood pressure reduction, guidelines recommend reducing blood pressure below
      140/90mm Hg, with a lower target in patients who are young or who have diabetes
      mellitus (with or without nephropathy) or non-diabetic nephropathy. Blood
      pressure reduction can be achieved with several classes of drugs, including
      diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists and calcium 
      channel antagonists. Calcium channel antagonists have been shown to reduce the
      risk of stroke and major cardiovascular events. However, it is still
      controversial whether different treatment regimens based on different drug
      classes can offer advantages beyond similar degrees of blood pressure control in 
      preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The International Nifedipine
      GITS Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) was a
      controlled clinical trial aimed at comparing the efficacy of a long-acting
      calcium channel antagonist, nifedipine gastrointestinal-transport-system (GITS), 
      versus co-amilozide, a combination of the diuretics hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)
      and amiloride, on morbidity and mortality in high-risk hypertensive patients.
      Nifedipine GITS and HCTZ/amiloride were equally effective at reducing blood
      pressure and the risk of primary outcomes (a composite of death from any
      cardiovascular or cerebrovascular cause, non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction 
      and heart failure). Results from other studies indicate that there may be greater
      benefits for stroke and smaller benefits for coronary artery disease with calcium
      channel antagonist-based regimens than with diuretic or beta-blocker-based
      regimens. However, there is at present insufficient evidence to recommend a
      specific drug choice based on patient risk profile. Thus, the choice of
      antihypertensive drug(s) should be according to efficacy and tolerability. In
      addition to the reductions in cardiovascular risk, two substudies of INSIGHT
      showed that nifedipine GITS was able to prevent the progression of intima media
      thickness in the common carotid artery and slow the progression of coronary
      calcification. The clinical significance of this effect in the prevention of
      cardiovascular events still remains to be established.

TI  - Immunohistochemical analysis of Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles and androgen receptor
      expression in the pathogenesis of nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
PG  - 422-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have demonstrated that gingival overgrowth may be
      associated with androgen and cytokine expression in tissues. OBJECTIVES: The aim 
      of this study was to compare the expression of androgen receptor-presenting cells
      (AR+ cells) and Th1/Th2 cytokine [Th1: interleukin (IL)-2, interferon-gamma
      (IFN-gamma); Th2: IL-4, IL-10, IL-13] expression cells in tissue sections of
      patients with gingival overgrowth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue samples were
      collected from patients with healthy periodontium (H group), adult periodontitis 
      (P group), surgically extracted teeth (S group), and nifedipine-induced gingival 
      overgrowth (NIGO group). The clinical periodontal parameters of pocket depth
      (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque control record (PCR) were measured
      around selected sample teeth. Gingival biopsies were further processed by
      immunohistochemical staining method. The expressions of cells positive for AR,
      IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 were counted by predetermined
      semiquantitative methods. RESULTS: Our results indicated that AR, IL-2,
      IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 were intensively expressed in the nuclei of
      inflammatory cells and fibroblasts of gingival connective tissue. Stronger
      expressions of AR, IL-2, and IFN-gamma were found in the NIGO group. The AR+
      cells/0.01 mm2 in gingival fibroblasts were significantly higher in the NIGO
      group (80.2 +/- 10.7) than those of the periodontitis group (52.5 +/- 11.8) and
      control group (37.4 +/- 11.3) (P < 0.05). The cytokine expression of the NIGO
      group showed a trend towards Th1-type expression (IL-2; P = 0.0001). In the
      surgically extracted tooth group, a stronger expression of Th2-type cytokine
      (IL-4, Il-10, IL-13; P < 0.05) was found in inflammatory cells. In a comparison
      of the IL-2/IL-4-labeled cell ratio of the four groups, a descending sequence was
      discovered as NIGO group (0.92 +/- 0.97) > H group (0.81 +/- 0.61) > P group
      (0.77 +/- 0.82) > S group (0.58 +/- 1.77). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the
      following: (i) taking nifedipine may elevate the expression of AR in susceptible 
      oral tissue, e.g. gingiva; (ii) the cytokine profile of T-cells in NIGO tissue
      indicates a trend preferentially towards Th1 activity; and (iii) elevation of AR 
      expression cells and prominent Th1 cytokine-labeled cells are two significant
      factors in the pathogenesis of NIGO.

TI  - Optimal medical management of angina.
PG  - 259-65
AB  - Coronary artery disease remains one of the principal causes of disability
      worldwide. Its most common manifestation is angina pectoris. Angina occurs due to
      an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply; it is classically
      precipitated by physical activity, emotion, eating, or cold weather. It is
      defined as stable when its frequency, severity, duration, time of appearance, and
      precipitating factors remain unchanged for 60 days. Treatment of patients with
      stable angina targets a number of factors that underlie its pathophysiology:
      aspirin as an antiplatelet agent, b-blockade to reduce myocardial oxygen demand, 
      and additional antianginal drugs when symptoms are incompletely controlled by
      b-blockers alone. Furthermore, aggressive treatment of risk factors for the
      development of coronary artery disease confers a significant mortality benefit.
      Unstable angina is defined as symptoms developing at rest, on minimal exertion,
      and of increasing severity, duration, or frequency. It is associated with
      significant mortality; consequently, early assessment and intervention is
      essential to prevent worsening ischemia. Treatment includes close in-patient
      monitoring, administration of antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs, and a
      combination of b-blockers, calcium antagonists, and intravenous nitrates where
      appropriate. Coronary revascularization should be considered in high-risk
      patients, and when conservative management strategies fail.

TI  - Anemia predicts mortality in severe heart failure: the prospective randomized
      amlodipine survival evaluation (PRAISE).
PG  - 1933-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to examine the relationships between serum hematocrit
      (Hct) and risk of all-cause mortality among patients with severe heart failure
      (HF). BACKGROUND: Anemia occurs with increased frequency in severe HF. However,
      few studies have examined the impact of anemia on mortality in this population.
      METHODS: Using a prospective cohort design, we evaluated the relationships
      between baseline serum Hct and mortality among 1,130 patients with left
      ventricular EF <30% and New York Heart Association functional class IIIB or IV HF
      treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. 
      Mortality was ascertained by centralized adjudication. RESULTS: The mean Hct was 
      41.8% (range 25.4% to 58.8%). Over 15 months of mean follow-up, there were 407
      deaths (29 per 100 person-years). After adjustment for potential confounders,
      those in the lowest quintile of Hct (range 25.4% to 37.5%) had a 52% higher risk 
      of death (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 2.10), compared with
      the highest quintile (range 46.1% to 58.8%). Within the lowest quintile of Hct,
      each 1% decrease in Hct was associated with an 11% higher risk of death (p <
      0.01), whereas within the four higher quintiles of Hct, Hct was not associated
      with total mortality. Evaluation of different causes of death indicated that a
      lower Hct was strongly associated with death from progressive HF, rather than
      sudden death or other deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with severe HF, anemia 
      is a significant independent risk factor for death, with a progressively higher
      risk with increasing severity of anemia. Further investigation of the etiologies,
      prevention, and treatment of anemia in severe HF is warranted.

TI  - Interaction of alcohol and drugs in fatal poisonings.
PG  - 281-7
AB  - In Finnish data from 1995-2000, 1006 fatal poisonings due to alcohol (ethanol), a
      single drug or both were statistically analysed in retrospect to evaluate the
      interaction between alcohol and drugs. In 53% of these cases, low concentrations 
      of some common benzodiazepines were present. The median postmortem blood alcohol 
      concentration (BAC) was 3.3 percent per thousand (w/w) in the 615 alcohol
      poisonings, but significantly lower, ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 percent per
      thousand, when promazine, doxepin, amitriptyline or propoxyphene were found
      together with alcohol. When levomepromazine, temazepam or zopiclone were present,
      the median BAC was also significantly lower, 2.5-2.7 percent per thousand.
      Citalopram and diltiazem did not exhibit a significant effect. The median BAC was
      significantly lower in cases with high concentrations than in those with low
      concentrations of a drug (excluding citalopram), suggesting a positive
      concentration-effect relationship. Fatal toxicity indices (FTIs) were calculated 
      by relating the number of deaths caused by a drug to the corresponding sales
      figures. Promazine had an extremely high FTI, followed by levomepromazine,
      propoxyphene, doxepin and amitriptyline. The other drugs had relatively low FTIs.
      The results reflect not only the acute toxicity of a given drug-alcohol
      combination but also the manners of use and abuse of these drugs.

TI  - ACE inhibitors versus diuretics: ALLHAT versus ANBP2.
PG  - 825-8
AB  - The ALLHAT (The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart
      Attack Trial) trial enrolled hypertensive patients with at least one additional
      risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) to a comparison of the diuretic
      chlorthalidone, the calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, and the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril. Throughout the study, 
      chlorthalidone decreased the systolic blood pressure to a slightly, but
      significantly greater extent (0.8-3.1 mmHg) than amlodipine or lisinopril. No
      significance differences were reported for amlodipine versus chlorthalidone or
      lisinopril versus chlorthalidone on the primary outcome of combined incidence of 
      fatal CHD and nonfatal myocardial infarction. The findings of ALLHAT support the 
      use of thiazide-type diuretics as first choice pharmacological therapy in at risk
      patients with hypertension. ANBP2 (The Second Australian National Blood Pressure 
      Study) was also a comparison between diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide) and ACE
      inhibitors (enalapril) but was performed in older hypertensives that had few
      previous cardiovascular events. Diastolic blood pressure reduction was similar in
      both groups at all times. The risk of the primary outcome of all cardiovascular
      events or death from any cause was 11% lower in the ACE group than the diuretic
      group and the benefit was predominantly in men. Thus, ANBP2 suggests that in
      relatively healthy elderly hypertensive patients, ACE inhibitors should be
      preferred to diuretics.

TI  - Shifting trends in the pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in a Nigerian
      tertiary hospital: a real-world evaluation of the efficacy, safety, rationality
      and pharmaco-economics of old and newer antihypertensive drugs.
PG  - 277-85
AB  - The current prescription patterns for essential hypertension and the efficacy,
      safety, tolerability and cost-effectiveness of the newer antihypertensive drugs
      were evaluated in Nigerian patients. The findings were compared with that of a
      previous study conducted in the same tertiary hospital 10 years earlier. A
      cross-sectional evaluation of blood pressure (BP) control in a hypertension
      clinic was undertaken among 150 Nigerian patients aged 61 +/- 12 years (55%
      females), with a duration of treatment on a particular drug class or combination 
      of 9 +/- 3 months. The initial blood pressure was 176 +/- 20/108 +/- 11 mmHg and 
      22% of the patient had concurrent diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics (D) alone
      or in combination remained the most commonly prescribed drugs in 56% of all
      patients. There were significant increases in the prescriptions of calcium
      channel blockers (CCBs) (51%), P < 0.0001, and ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) (24%), P < 
      0.0001, but a slight reduction in the use of methyldopa, and fixed drug
      combinations (P < 0.01) compared to the previous study. The fall in systolic
      blood pressure on D (r = 0.65, P < 0.001) or CCB (r = 0.48, P < 0.02) was
      significantly correlated with the initial systolic blood pressure, but not age.
      More patients achieved normotension BP < 140/90 mmHg on CCB monotherapy (71%),
      than D monotherapy (56%). Combination therapy with ACEIs + D or
      methyldopa+thiazides normalized BP in 63 and 68%, respectively. Pulse pressure, a
      surrogate marker for cardiovascular complications and mortality in essential
      hypertension, was significantly reduced (P < 0.01) equally by all treatments,
      with 95% confidence intervals ranging from -28 to -1 mmHg. However,
      hypertensive-diabetic (HT-DM) patients (n = 33) exhibited no significant change
      in pulse pressure in response to treatment. Adverse drug reactions that occurred 
      in 11% were impotence or postural dizziness with D, headache and pitting oedema
      with CCB, and dry cough with ACEI. Pharmaco-economic comparison of the drug
      classes revealed that for every US dollar (dollar) spent per month, the
      percentage of treated patients attaining normotension was 18.6 for D, 4.73 for
      CCB, 3.5 for ACEI + D and 13.6 for methyldopa + thiazides. A combination of ACEI 
      + CCB or D was the preferred treatment for hypertensive-diabetic Nigerians, but
      only 24% attained a BP < 130/85 mmHg. These results demonstrate a shift in trend 
      to a more rational and efficacious treatment of hypertension over a 10 year
      period. This may be associated, at least in part, with the intensive and
      continuous education of the prescribers in rational drug use and the introduction
      of a hospital formulary. Methyldopa is still a highly efficacious and
      cost-effective drug in this population. Black HT-DM Africans still constitute a
      subgroup who not only require more and costlier antihypertensive drugs, but whose
      BP control is suboptimal, and exhibit a poor therapeutic response to other risk
      factors (pulse pressure) that constitute a continuing risk for cardiovascular
      mortality.

TI  - Cardiovascular drug therapy in the elderly: theoretical and practical
      considerations.
PG  - 445-63
AB  - The elderly population is expanding rapidly throughout the world. Hypertension,
      heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders are prevalent conditions among
      this age group. Consequently, clinicians will spend a large proportion of their
      practices managing older adults with cardiovascular disorders. A large proportion
      of this time will be devoted to using pharmacotherapeutic strategies for the
      long-term management of chronic conditions. The physiological changes that
      accompany aging affect cardiovascular function, and the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of many cardiovascular medications are altered by these
      physiological changes. The interactions of these changes can have a profound
      effect on the agents used to treat cardiovascular disorders and may alter their
      therapeutic outcomes. Several classes of medications are used to treat chronic
      cardiovascular disorders in older adults. These include the ACE inhibitors and
      angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists,
      beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), oral antiarrhythmic agents and
      warfarin. Drugs such as beta-blockers may aggravate decreased cardiac output and 
      increase peripheral resistance, but are valuable adjuncts in many patients with
      congestive heart failure. Agents that reduce angiotensin II activity may have
      several benefits for treating heart failure and hypertension. Successful
      treatment of cardiovascular disorders in older adults requires the choice of the 
      most appropriate agent, taking into consideration the complex interactions of
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and disease effects.

TI  - Effects of nicardipine and clonidine on cognitive functions and
      electroencephalography in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 527-35
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive and electroencephalography
      (EEG) short-term effects of a calcium antagonist, nicardipine, compared to
      placebo and clonidine (which, having known sedative effects, acted as a negative 
      control) for 15 days in elderly hypertensive patients with memory complaints.
      Nicardipine and clonidine were compared with placebo in a double-blind,
      randomized, three-way cross-over controlled study after a 2-week placebo run-in
      period. This was a phase II clinical study carried out on out-patients in a
      single research centre. Fifteen elderly (63 +/- 10 years) hypertensive patients, 
      without dementia but with memory complaints, were included. Psychomotor
      performance and cognition were assessed using both an extensive battery of
      validated psychometric tests (which evaluated attention and vigilance, body sway 
      and memory) and an EEG profile. Cardiovascular parameters measured were blood
      pressure and heart rate. No detrimental effects of nicardipine were found on
      attention, vigilance, body sway or memory. Nicardipine produced a significant
      increase in alpha EEG energies, which may indicate possible alerting effects. In 
      contrast, clonidine induced well-known deleterious sedative effects in
      psychometric tests and in EEG analysis (decrease in alpha and increase in delta
      and theta waves). The two drugs produced equivalent decreases in blood pressure
      at steady state. In conclusion, clonidine induced well-known sedative effects,
      while nicardipine did not impair central nervous system activity and may have had
      some short-term alerting effects in elderly hypertensive patients with memory
      complaints. This study supports the hypothesis of a dissociation between blood
      pressure and direct drug effects on the central nervous system.

TI  - Antihypertensive medication and quality of life--silent treatment of a silent
      killer?
PG  - 353-64
AB  - Hypertension is one of the major killers in the modern world and one of the great
      ironies of the disease is that it has little or no immediate effect on affected
      individuals' quality of life (QOL). This makes treatment very difficult, as most 
      medications will affect QOL negatively, either through side effects or through
      the change in life-style associated with chronic drug regimens. This review
      describes some of the conceptual background for QOL measurements and looks at the
      effects on QOL of different antihypertensive treatments available today. The
      latest addition to the range of antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin II-receptor
      blockers, may be a significant step forward in treatment, as their ease of dosing
      and excellent tolerability minimise negative effects on patients while their
      possible benefits on factors such as sexual function may even improve QOL in
      hypertensive patients.

TI  - Stroke units - the Norwegian experience.
PG  - 19-20
AB  - The main aims of acute stroke care should be to reduce death and disability.
      Treatment in stroke units is the only treatment option proven to reduce death in 
      acute stroke patients. Stroke unit care is also the only treatment which has
      shown a marked reduction in disability for general stroke patients, and also the 
      only treatment with beneficial long-term effects on survival, disability and
      quality of life. Most acute hospitals in Norway have established stroke units.
      The recommended stroke unit model is a non-intensive combined unit able to focus 
      simultaneously both on acute care and rehabilitation. This model has been very
      well evaluated in randomised trials and has achieved some of the best results
      regarding acute stroke care. Hence one can probably conclude that stroke unit
      care in Norway is evidence based.

TI  - Delayed presentation of calcium channel antagonist overdose.
PG  - 132-4
AB  - The calcium channel antagonists are generally safe in therapeutic dosage, but
      severe side effects with elevated intake are increasingly described. Typical
      features include confusion, lethargy, hypotension, sinus node depression, and
      cardiac conduction defects. Even if patients are stable on presentation, this
      does not preclude the possible late development of adverse events from the
      long-acting formulations of calcium channel blockers. A case of toxic overdose
      with 1440 mg of slow-release diltiazem is presented; this patient was stable on
      presentation, but rapidly became hemodynamically unstable, requiring treatment
      with intravenous calcium, temporary pacemaker, inotropic support and mechanical
      ventilation with a successful outcome. A concise review of the therapeutic
      considerations is provided.

TI  - Peyronie's disease: a review.
PG  - 1234-41
AB  - PURPOSE: We provide a current review of Peyronie's disease. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We reviewed the world peer reviewed literature on the pathology,
      pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of Peyronie's disease. RESULTS: The
      incidence of Peyronie's disease has continuously increased during the last 30
      years. However, fewer patients need prosthesis surgery as the sole treatment
      option because of earlier diagnosis, improved medical therapy, refinement in
      surgical technique and better understanding of the basic sciences of the disease.
      CONCLUSIONS: Currently patients with Peyronie's disease have had improvements in 
      prognosis and experienced an expansion of the available therapeutic options.

TI  - Treatment of arrhythmias during pregnancy.
PG  - 135-9
AB  - During pregnancy, significant changes occur in the hormonal and hemodynamic state
      of women that make arrhythmias more likely to occur. Palpitations are frequently 
      reported, but are usually found to be associated with sinus tachycardia. The
      incidence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia is increased during
      pregnancy, whereas atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are rarely
      seen. Women with long QT syndrome experience significantly more cardiac events in
      the postpartum period, making beta-blocker therapy most important during this
      time. Acute treatment of arrhythmias for pregnant women is much the same as that 
      for nonpregnant patients. However, chronic drug therapy during pregnancy should
      be reserved for only the frequent, hemodynamically significant arrhythmia
      episodes.

TI  - Stenting of a renal artery compressed by the diaphragm.
PG  - 213-4
AB  - A 74-year-old man had a resistant hypertension with an increase in plasma
      aldosterone and active plasma renin levels, and an irregular appearance of the
      left kidney outline by ultrasound. The CT scan showed a stenosis of the left
      renal artery, which was pushed against the aorta by the left crus of the
      diaphragm. An angioplasty with placement of an autoexpansible stent was carried
      out with a good result on the arterial pressure level. After 3 years, the patient
      was re-hospitalised with severe hypertension. The CT scan demonstrated a
      compression of the stent by the left crus of the diaphragm, with good
      permeability of the artery downstream from the stent, and radiographic
      examination showed a fracture of the left renal artery stent. Thus, a
      reimplantation of the left renal artery in the aorta was carried out. Stenosis of
      the renal artery by fibres from a crus of the diaphragm is a rare cause of
      renovascular hypertension. Helicoidal angioscanner imaging is particularly useful
      to do the diagnosis. In the present case, renal angioplasty with stenting was
      complicated by a fracture of the stent that led to the surgery. Thus, when renal 
      artery stenosis by a crus of the diaphragm is diagnosed, surgical treatment needs
      to be considered on a case-by-case basis in relation to the anatomy and the
      biological and functional data.

TI  - A basic conceptual and practical overview of interactions with highly prescribed 
      drugs.
PG  - 191-8
AB  - Drug interactions are frequently the result of altered activity of the
      mechanism(s) responsible for drug elimination. These include drug metabolism
      mediated by a select group of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9,
      CYP2C19, CYP1A2) and drug transporters (P-glycoprotein). Adverse drug
      interactions can result from induction (loss of therapeutic benefit) or
      inhibition (increased toxicity from excessive effect) of drug elimination. CYPs
      and P-glycoprotein are discussed individually with regards to their
      characteristics, frequently prescribed drug substrates, inducers and inhibitors, 
      and important adverse drug events. The potential for important drug interactions 
      can be predicted based on the properties of the causative agent (oral
      bioavailability, mechanism of elimination, seriousness of adverse event) and the 
      interacting agent. Consequently, drug interactions can be prevented by avoiding
      concomitant administration of interacting substances or possibly implementing
      alternative therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, susceptibility to adverse events
      depends not only on the interacting substances, but also on the patient and the
      method of drug administration. Commonly prescribed drugs that are unlikely to
      cause a drug interaction involving CYPs or P-glycoprotein are also discussed.

TI  - Comparison of effects of nisoldipine-extended release and amlodipine in patients 
      with systemic hypertension and chronic stable angina pectoris.
PG  - 274-9
AB  - The efficacy and safety of nisoldipine-extended release (ER) and amlodipine were 
      compared in a 6-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy,
      parallel group, titration-to-effect trial in patients with stage 1 to 2 systemic 
      hypertension (90 to 109 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure [BP]) and chronic stable
      angina pectoris. After a 3-week placebo run-in period, patients (n = 120) were
      randomly assigned to active treatment with either nisoldipine-ER (20 to 40 mg) or
      amlodipine (5 to 10 mg) once daily, titrated as necessary after 2 weeks to
      achieve diastolic BP <90 mm Hg. After 6 weeks, the mean reduction in
      systolic/diastolic BP from baseline was 15/13 mm Hg with nisoldipine-ER and 13/11
      mm Hg with amlodipine (p = NS/p = NS). Both drugs resulted in similar BP
      responder rates (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg in 87% of patients who received
      nisoldipine-ER and 78% of patients on amlodipine, p = NS) and anti-ischemic
      responder rates (increasing exercise time >20% in 20% and 27%, respectively [p = 
      NS], and increasing exercise time >60 seconds in 32% and 29% of patients,
      respectively [p = NS]. Also, after 6 weeks of active therapy, there was a similar
      mean increase in total exercise duration (23 seconds in the nisoldipine-ER group 
      and 21 seconds in the amlodipine group, p = NS). Neither drug increased heart
      rate and both decreased frequency of anginal episodes. Adverse events were
      infrequent, and typically were vasodilator-related effects (including headache
      and peripheral edema) that occurred with somewhat higher incidence in the
      nisoldipine-ER group. Thus, nisoldipine-ER and amlodipine provided comparable
      antihypertensive and anti-ischemic efficacy, and both were generally well
      tolerated.

TI  - Adverse drug events associated with hospital admission.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To increase the knowledge base on the frequency, causality, and
      avoidability of adverse drug events (ADEs) as a cause for admission in internal
      medicine or when occurring during hospitalization. METHODS: A prospective study
      was performed for 6 periods of 8 days each. Epidemiologic data (e.g., age,
      gender, medical history), drug utilization, and adverse drug reactions on
      patients hospitalized during these periods were collected by a pharmacy student. 
      RESULTS: A total of 156 patients (70 men and 86 women) were included in the
      study. The patients' mean age +/- SD was 66.5 +/- 18.1 years and mean length of
      stay was 13.2 +/- 9 days. Renal and hepatic insufficiency and previous history of
      drug intolerance were observed in 17.9%, 10.2%, and 2% of the hospitalized
      patients, respectively. Thirty-eight ADEs occurred in 32 patients; in 15 cases,
      ADEs were identified as the reason for admission, 10 cases occurred during
      hospitalization, and 13 cases were present at admission, but were not the cause
      of admission. The most frequent ADEs involved the neurologic (23.6%), renal
      (15.7%), and hematologic (13.1%) systems. Among these 38 ADEs, 22 were considered
      avoidable (57.9%); 20 of these were associated with therapeutic errors
      (inappropriate administration, drug-drug interactions, dosage error, drug not
      stopped despite the onset of ADEs). Patients with ADEs stayed longer in the
      hospital and took more drugs both before and during their hospital stay (p <
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the ADEs observed in this study were avoidable. The
      risk/benefit ratio of administered drugs could be improved with better knowledge 
      of the patients' medical history and the risk factors of ADEs.

TI  - Macrophage subpopulations in gingival overgrowth induced by nifedipine and
      immunosuppressive medication.
PG  - 1323-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: The immunomodulating effects of both immunosuppressive and nifedipine
      medication have been associated with drug-induced gingival overgrowth. The aim of
      the study reported here was to evaluate the presence of macrophage subpopulations
      in normal human gingiva and in gingival overgrowth induced by nifedipine and
      immunosuppressive medication. METHODS: Gingival samples were taken from 11
      nifedipine-medicated cardiac outpatients (nifedipine group), 11 triple-medicated 
      organ-transplant recipients also taking nifedipine (immunosuppression plus
      nifedipine group), 12 triple-medicated organ-transplant recipients
      (immunosuppression group), and 20 generally healthy individuals (control group). 
      Cryostat sections were stained with mAbs for inflammatory 27E10, reparative
      RM3/1, and resident 25F9 macrophages using an avidin-biotin enzyme complex
      method. Total numbers of mAb-labeled cells were determined in connective tissue
      beneath sulcular epithelium, connective tissue beneath oral epithelium, and
      middle connective tissue. Expression of 27E10 was determined in keratinocytes in 
      the oral epithelium. Statistics analyses were undertaken using the chi-square
      test, the Mann-Whitney U test, the independent samples t test, analysis of
      variance, and analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Greater numbers of inflammatory
      27E10-positive macrophages were found in all 3 medicated groups and counting
      zones than in the control group except in connective tissue beneath sulcular
      epithelium in the immunosuppression group. The incidence of specimens expressing 
      27E10 antigen throughout the oral epithelium was significantly higher in the
      immunosuppression group (8 of 12) than in the control group (4 of 20) and the
      nifedipine group (2 of 11). Numbers of reparative RM3/1-positive macrophages were
      significantly greater in the immunosuppression group in connective tissue beneath
      oral epithelium than in the control group. The effect was markedly associated
      with degree of inflammation. Numbers of resident 25F9-positive macrophages were
      lower in connective tissue beneath sulcular epithelium in the immunosuppression
      group, and higher in middle connective tissue in the nifedipine group than in the
      control group. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the nature of drug-induced
      gingival overgrowth differs somewhat between immunosuppressive and nifedipine
      medications.

TI  - Treatment of hypertension from volume to vasoconstriction: The ACE up your
      sleeve.
PG  - 225-36
AB  - Control of hypertension in the vascular patient is clearly a priority. However,
      these patients often will have significant co-morbidities that may influence the 
      choice of medication, a decision that also may be affected by cost or Health Plan
      directives. Wherever possible, monotherapy should be attempted first, although in
      select circumstances combination therapy may be more appropriate. The 5 main
      categories of drugs used in the initial treatment of hypertensive vascular
      diseases are (1). diuretics, (2). beta-adrenergic blockers, (3). calcium channel 
      blockers, (4). angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and (5).
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There are also other less commonly used
      drugs. Each of the antihypertensive agents is roughly equally effective,
      producing a good antihypertensive response in 40% to 60% of cases. Some
      antihypertensives, especially ACE and ARBs, also may have beneficial effects on
      the vascular and metabolic systems separate from their blood pressure lowering
      effects, which suggests they may be beneficial even if blood pressure is well
      maintained with other agents. This report covers the basic information required
      for the vascular surgeon to become familiar with the various medications and
      their indications, dosage, and side effects. It also provides some guidelines in 
      selecting relevant antihypertensive treatment regimens for the elderly patient
      with arterial vascular disease.

TI  - A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with recurrent
      persistent atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1834-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maintenance of sinus rhythm is the main therapeutic goal in patients 
      with atrial fibrillation. However, recurrences of atrial fibrillation and side
      effects of antiarrhythmic drugs offset the benefits of sinus rhythm. We
      hypothesized that ventricular rate control is not inferior to the maintenance of 
      sinus rhythm for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We randomly
      assigned 522 patients who had persistent atrial fibrillation after a previous
      electrical cardioversion to receive treatment aimed at rate control or rhythm
      control. Patients in the rate-control group received oral anticoagulant drugs and
      rate-slowing medication. Patients in the rhythm-control group underwent serial
      cardioversions and received antiarrhythmic drugs and oral anticoagulant drugs.
      The end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, heart failure,
      thromboembolic complications, bleeding, implantation of a pacemaker, and severe
      adverse effects of drugs. RESULTS: After a mean (+/-SD) of 2.3+/-0.6 years, 39
      percent of the 266 patients in the rhythm-control group had sinus rhythm, as
      compared with 10 percent of the 256 patients in the rate-control group. The
      primary end point occurred in 44 patients (17.2 percent) in the rate-control
      group and in 60 (22.6 percent) in the rhythm-control group. The 90 percent
      (two-sided) upper boundary of the absolute difference in the primary end point
      was 0.4 percent (the prespecified criterion for noninferiority was 10 percent or 
      less). The distribution of the various components of the primary end point was
      similar in the rate-control and rhythm-control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Rate control 
      is not inferior to rhythm control for the prevention of death and morbidity from 
      cardiovascular causes and may be appropriate therapy in patients with a
      recurrence of persistent atrial fibrillation after electrical cardioversion.

TI  - Effects of amlodipine fosinopril combination on microalbuminuria in hypertensive 
      type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 1042-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to compare the long-term effect of
      amlodipine and fosinopril in monotherapy or in combination on urinary albumin
      excretion (UAE) in hypertensive diabetic patients. METHODS: We selected 453
      hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria and randomized
      them to amlodipine (5 to 15 mg/day), fosinopril (10 to 30 mg/day), or amlodipine 
      plus fosinopril (5/10 to 15/30 mg/day) for a 3-month titration period. The
      nonresponder patients or those complaining of side effects during the titration
      period were discontinued (n = 144); the remaining 309 patients were enrolled in
      the trial and treated with the same therapy for 4 years. Every 6 months, blood
      pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), UAE, creatinine clearance, and glycosylated
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) were evaluated. RESULTS: The combination therapy was more
      effective in reducing BP than either drug alone at any time of the study without 
      affecting glucose homeostasis. All three treatments provided a significant
      decrease in UAE during the 48-month study period. However, this effect was more
      pronounced and became evident earlier with fosinopril than with amlodipine
      monotherapy (after 3 v 18 months of therapy). In addition, the combination
      therapy provided a greater antialbuminuric effect than the single drugs. This
      could be due to the greater antihypertensive effects, although other
      drug-specific effects cannot be excluded. The cardiovascular outcomes were
      similar in the amlodipine and in the fosinopril group, but they were lower in the
      combination group. CONCLUSIONS: These results strengthen the rationale to use a
      calcium-antagonist/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor combination in the
      treatment of hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Metabolic effects of combined antihypertensive treatment in patients with
      essential hypertension.
PG  - 916-21
AB  - Single-drug treatment of essential hypertension (HT) is often insufficient to
      normalize blood pressure (BP), and high doses of antihypertensive agents can have
      adverse effects on glucose tolerance (GT) and insulin sensitivity. This study
      tested whether aggressive BP lowering with combination treatment had any
      influence on GT or insulin action. In all, 29 nonobese (body mass index [BMI],
      <30 kg/m ), normolipidemic patients with established HT (159 +/- 3/99 +/- 1 mm
      Hg) but normal GT were recruited. Eleven normotensive (125 +/- 3/85 +/- 1 mm Hg) 
      subjects were matched to the patients for both anthropometric and metabolic
      variables. Following baseline studies (serum lipid profile, oral GT, insulin
      release, and insulin sensitivity assessed by the insulin clamp technique),
      patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to two combination regimens
      (verapamil 180 mg/day + trandolapril 2 mg/day or atenolol 50 mg/day + nifedipine 
      20 mg/day) and restudied 3 months later. Blood pressure was normalized in both
      groups (with decrements of 25 +/- 5/17 +/- 2 and 29 +/- 3/15 +/- 2 mm Hg,
      respectively). Lipid profile, GT, insulin release, and insulin sensitivity of
      both glucose uptake and lipolysis were unchanged following both treatments. The
      authors conclude that in nonobese, normolipidemic, glucose-tolerant hypertensive 
      patients, BP normalization with combination therapy is feasible at no cost in
      terms of undesired effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin
      sensitivity.

TI  - Tolerability of long-term treatment with lercanidipine versus amlodipine and
      lacidipine in elderly hypertensives.
PG  - 932-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irrespective of their clinical relevance, side effects cannot be
      considered a negligible problem in antihypertensive therapy. The aim of this
      trial was to evaluate the tolerability profile of lercanidipine with that of two 
      other calcium antagonists (amlodipine and lacidipine) in elderly hypertensives.
      METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind, parallel study 828 elderly (aged > or
      =60 years) hypertensives were randomized to lercanidipine 10 mg/day (n = 420),
      amlodipine 5 mg/day (n = 200), or lacidipine 2 mg/day (n = 208) (ratio 2:1:1). If
      blood pressure (BP) control was unsatisfactory (systolic BP/diastolic BP > or
      =140/90 mm Hg), the dose of the double-blind medication was doubled and, as a
      further step, enalapril or atenolol (plus diuretic, if needed) was added.
      Patients were treated for an average of 12 months. RESULTS: Amlodipine patients
      had significantly (P <.001) higher rates of edema (19%) and of early study
      discontinuations due to edema (8.5%) compared with lercanidipine (9% and 2.1%)
      and lacidipine patients (4% and 1.4%). Similarly, edema-related symptoms (lower
      limb swelling and heaviness) occurred significantly (P <.01) more often with
      amlodipine (50% and 45%, respectively) than with lercanidipine (35% and 33%) and 
      lacidipine (34% and 31%). Most edema cases occurred in the first 6 months, a
      between-treatment difference being evident since beginning of treatment. Other
      drug-related adverse events did not differ between treatments. Blood pressure was
      equally and effectively reduced in the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The two
      lipophilic dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, lercanidipine and lacidipine,
      have an antihypertensive effect comparable to that of amlodipine, but a better
      tolerability profile.

TI  - Rhabdomyolysis due to red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) in a renal transplant
      recipient.
PG  - 1200-1
AB  - Rhabdomyolysis is a known complication of hepatic 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
      reductase (HMG-CoA) inhibitor (statin) therapy for posttransplant hyperlipidemia,
      and thus monitoring for this effect is indicated. We report a case of an herbal
      preparation-induced rhabdomyolysis in a stable renal-transplant recipient,
      attributed to the presence of red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) within the
      mixture. The condition resolved when consumption of the product ceased. Rice
      fermented with red yeast contains several types of mevinic acids, including
      monacolin K, which is identical to lovastatin. We postulate that the interaction 
      of cyclosporine and these compounds through the cytochrome P450 system resulted
      in the adverse effect seen in this patient. Transplant recipients must be
      cautioned against using herbal preparations to lower their lipid levels to
      prevent such complications from occurring.

TI  - Clinical treatment regimens for chronic heart failure: a review.
PG  - 1569-76
AB  - Chronic heart failure (CHF) is increasing in prevalence worldwide, particularly
      in the elderly. Accordingly, this epidemic is likely to translate into a major
      increase in healthcare costs. Systolic heart failure is the most common cause of 
      CHF presentations. Although the causes vary, the most common single aetiological 
      factor is ischaemic heart disease, which accounts for approximately 50% of heart 
      failure presentations. Research into CHF pharmacotherapy has been copious, with
      the focus principally centred on systolic heart failure. The evidence base for
      pharmacotherapy in CHF is amongst the largest currently in clinical medicine.
      There have been multiple trials establishing the mortality and morbidity benefits
      of pharmacotherapy. Amongst these, large scale trials of angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and spironolactone have provided a sound basis
      for evidence-based treatment approaches to the CHF patient. Recently research
      interest has increased in biomedical engineering with studies being performed in 
      biventricular pacing and mechanical hearts. Early data with biventricular pacing 
      or cardiac resynchronisation therapy is encouraging. Diastolic heart failure
      alone accounts for at least 20 - 40% of CHF presentations and whilst it may occur
      in isolation, is most commonly seen in association with systolic heart failure.
      In this study, we present a broad overview of the current therapeutic modalities 
      for the management of CHF, with particular emphasis on pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Extent of use of immediate-release formulations of calcium channel blockers as
      antihypertensive monotherapy by primary care physicians: multicentric study from 
      Bahrain.
PG  - 172-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The issue of cardiovascular safety of calcium channel blockers (CCBs)
      has been widely debated in view of reflex increase in sympathetic activity
      induced by immediate release (IR) / short acting formulations. It is generally
      agreed that such CCBs should not be used alone in the management of hypertension.
      AIMS: We have determined the extent to which primary care physicians prescribe
      CCBs as monotherapy, especially the immediate release formulations, in the
      management of uncomplicated hypertension and diabetic hypertension - with an
      emphasis upon the age of the patients. SETTING, DESIGN AND METHODS: A
      retrospective prescription-based study was carried out in seven out of 18 Health 
      Centres in Bahrain. The study involved a registered population of 229,300
      representing 46% of registered individuals, and 35 physicians representing 43% of
      all primary care physicians. The data was collected between November 1998 and
      January 1999 using chronic dispensing cards. RESULTS: In all categories CCBs were
      the third commonly prescribed antihypertensive as monotherapy, with a
      prescription rate of 11.1% in uncomplicated hypertension, 18% in diabetic
      hypertension and 20.1% in elderly patients above 65 years of age. Nifedipine
      formulations were the most extensively prescribed CCBs. Almost half of the
      CCB-treated patients were on IR-nifedipine, whereas IR-diltiazem and
      IR-verapamil, and amlodipine were infrequently prescribed. CONCLUSION:
      Prescription of IR-formulations of CCBs as monotherapy by primary care physicians
      does not conform with recommended guidelines. In view of concerns about the
      safety of such practice, measures to change the prescribing pattern are required.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation in the elderly: facts and management.
PG  - 819-46
AB  - Although atrial fibrillation is not widely known by the general public, in
      developed countries it is the most common arrhythmia. The incidence increases
      markedly with advancing age. Thus, with the growing proportion of elderly
      individuals, atrial fibrillation will come to represent a significant medical and
      socioeconomic problem. The consequences of atrial fibrillation have the greatest 
      impact. The risk of thromboembolism is well known; other outcomes of atrial
      fibrillation are less well recognised, such as its relationship with dementia,
      depression and death. Such consequences are responsible for diminished quality of
      life and considerable economic cost. Atrial fibrillation is characterised by
      rapid and disorganised atrial activity, with a frequency between 300 and 600
      beats/minute. The ventricles react irregularly, and may contract rapidly or
      slowly depending on the health of the conduction system. Clinical symptoms are
      varied, including palpitations, syncope, dizziness or embolic events. Atrial
      fibrillation may be paroxysmal, persistent or chronic, and a number of attacks
      are asymptomatic. Suspicion or confirmation of atrial fibrillation necessitates
      investigation and, as far as possible, appropriate treatment of underlying causes
      such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism and congestive 
      heart failure. In the evaluation of atrial fibrillation, cardiac exploration is
      invaluable, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography, with the aim 
      of detecting cardiac abnormalities and directing management. In elderly patients 
      (arbitrarily defined as aged >75 years), the management of atrial fibrillation
      varies; it requires an individual approach, which largely depends on comorbid
      conditions, underlying cardiac disease, and patient and physician preferences.
      This management is essentially based on pharmacological treatment, but there are 
      also nonpharmacological options. Two alternatives are possible: restoration and
      maintenance of sinus rhythm, or control of ventricular rate, leaving the atria in
      arrhythmia. Pharmacological options include antiarrhythmic drugs, such as class
      III agents, beta-blockers and class IC agents. These drugs have some adverse
      effects, and careful monitoring is necessary. The nonpharmacological approach to 
      atrial fibrillation includes external or internal direct-current cardioversion
      and new methods, such as catheter ablation of specific foci, an evolving science 
      that has been shown to be successful in a very select group of atrial
      fibrillation patients. Another serious challenge in the management of chronic
      atrial fibrillation in older individuals is the prevention of stroke, its primary
      outcome, by choosing an appropriate antithrombotic treatment (aspirin or
      warfarin). Several risk-stratification schemes have been validated and may be
      helpful to determine the best antithrombotic choice in individual patients.

TI  - Protective effect of anti-hypertensive treatment on cognitive function in
      essential hypertension: analysis of published clinical data.
PG  - 147-51
AB  - Hypertension is a risk factor for stroke and may also contribute to the
      development of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and vascular dementia (VaD).
      Cognitive complications of hypertension and the influence of anti-hypertensive
      treatment were underestimated until recently. In this paper, trials investigating
      the effect of anti-hypertensive treatment on cognitive function were evaluated.
      Analysis of these studies revealed that until approximately 1990-1995
      investigations have assessed primarily if anti-hypertensive treatment impaired
      cognitive function. Only more recent studies have investigated positive effects
      on cognition of anti-hypertensive medication. Drugs more extensively evaluated
      were diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
      sartanes and Ca(2+) channel blockers. Available studies have confirmed that
      elevated diastolic blood pressure or pulse pressure and isolated systolic
      hypertension play an important role in the development of cognitive impairment.
      Randomized placebo-controlled trials have provided evidence that reduction of
      hypertension safely and effectively decreases morbidity and mortality rates and
      cognitive complications of hypertension. Ca(2+) channel blockers and ACE
      inhibitors have been shown to be effective and probably better than diuretics and
      beta-blockers on cognitive domains of hypertension. More extensive investigations
      could contribute to establishing optimal choice and drug dosage for the treatment
      of cognitive complications of hypertension.

TI  - Primary pulmonary hypertension: Current therapy.
PG  - 115-28
AB  - Because the causes of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) remains unknown, the
      therapeutic approach of the disease can be only empirical, based on the pathology
      and pathobiology of pulmonary circulation. Despite the inability to cure the
      disease, therapeutic advances over the past 20 years have contributed to an
      improvement of quality of life and prolonged survival in PPH patients. Current
      therapeutic approach of PPH mostly includes limitation of physical activity,
      long-term anticoagulation, and vasodilator therapy. Among all tested oral
      vasodilators, calcium-channel blockers are the most efficient long-term therapies
      by improving symptoms and hemodynamics in a subset of PPH patients (10% to 15%)
      who acutely respond to such drugs. Acute pulmonary vasodilator response to
      inhalation of nitric oxide can predict acute and chronic responses to oral
      calcium-channel blockers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of PPH has
      changed the focus of medical treatments from purely chronic vasodilator therapy
      to the evaluation of agents, such as prostaglandins, that may reverse the
      proliferation of pulmonary vascular cells and result in regression of the
      pulmonary vascular hypertrophy and remodeling. Long-term treatment with
      intravenous epoprostenol (prostaglandin I(2) or prostacyclin) improves exercise
      capacity, hemodynamics and survival in most patients with PPH in functional class
      NYHA III or IV, and may be currently considered as the "gold standard" therapy
      for severe patients. However, response to long-term epoprostenol therapy may be
      incomplete, adverse effects are common, and survival remains unsatisfactory (55% 
      at 5 years). In such patients with severe pulmonary hypertension refractory to
      medical therapy, atrioseptostomy and lung transplantation can be indicated.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of losartan-amplodipine combination--an Indian postmarketing 
      surveillance experience.
PG  - 207-8
AB  - The present study was conducted among 719 patients enrolled by 109 doctors to
      evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of losartan potassium
      and amlodipine besylate in Indian patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
      Out of them 11 patients were dropped out. Of these 708 patients 643 patients
      received once daily dosage of the combination whereas 10 patients received 1/2
      daily, 13 patients received 1 1/2 daily and 42 patients received 1 twice daily
      dosage of the combination. The mean SBP in the study was 172.89 +/- 19.18 mm Hg
      baseline. After the 10-day treatment, the mean SBP had significant reduction ie, 
      13.1% from basal and at the end of day 20 of the treatment, the reduction was
      19.13% from the baseline which was significant. Similarly mean DBP was 105.42 +/-
      10.85 mm Hg at baseline. After treatment, the mean DBP had significant reduction.
      After 10- day treatment, there was 12.7% reduction from the baseline and at the
      end of the treatment ie, after day 20, the reduction was 17.70% from basal, which
      was significant. Global evaluation of efficacy was done by the physicians; 93.8% 
      of the cases had excellent to good response and 4.9% patients had fair response. 
      Details of any adverse event reported or noted during the treatment with the
      combination were recorded in the appropriate section of the case record form,
      whether considered treatment related or not, as reported by the patients. The
      severity of an adverse event was graded on a 3-point scale as mild, moderate and 
      severe. The most common side-effects reported were oedema of feet (5.08%), ankle 
      oedema (1.98%). Remaining adverse events included some cardiovascular events such
      as palpitations, gastro-intestinal events such as constipation, miscellaneous
      events, muscular pain, weakness, generalised swelling, etc. CNS events included
      giddiness, headache, insomnia, etc.

TI  - Drug-drug interactions in the elderly.
PG  - 1675-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the frequency of potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in 
      an outpatient group of elderly people in 6 European countries, as well as to
      describe differences among countries. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: Drug use data
      were collected from 1601 elderly persons living in 6 European countries. The
      study population participated in a controlled intervention study over 18 months
      investigating the impact of pharmaceutical care. Potential DDIs were studied
      using a computerized detection program. RESULTS: The elderly population used on
      average 7.0 drugs per person; 46% had at least 1 drug combination possibly
      leading to a DDI. On average, there were 0.83 potential DDIs per person. Almost
      10% of the potential DDIs were classified to be avoided according to the Swedish 
      interaction classification system, but nearly one-third of them were to be
      avoided only for predisposed patients. The risk of subtherapeutic effect as a
      result of a potential DDI was as common as the risk of adverse reactions.
      Furthermore, we found differences in the frequency and type of potential DDIs
      among the countries. CONCLUSIONS: Potential DDIs are common in elderly people
      using many drugs and are part of a normal drug regimen. Some combinations are
      likely to have negative effects; more attention must be focused on detecting and 
      monitoring patients using such combinations. As differences in potential DDIs
      among countries were found, the reasons for this variability need to be explored 
      in further studies.

TI  - Biologic and molecular mechanisms for sex differences in pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics: Part I.
PG  - 601-15
AB  - There are pharmacological differences between women and men that have important
      clinical consequences. For several drugs, there is a higher incidence in women of
      drug-induced QT prolongation and a potentially fatal arrhythmia, torsades de
      pointes. This may be a reflection of the longer baseline QT interval in women. A 
      difference in cardiovascular disease between women and men is that women have a
      higher mortality rate after myocardial infarction (MI). Women also have a higher 
      rate of hemorrhagic stroke after receiving thrombolytic therapy for an MI.
      Differences in effectiveness of analgesics have been demonstrated, with kappa
      opioids providing pain relief for women but not men. Drugs may have different
      pharmacokinetics in women and men because of differences in phase I and phase II 
      enzymes that metabolize drugs. Conflicting results about biological sex
      differences have been reported for the major drug metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome
      P450 3A4 (3A4) and may be related to a role for P-glycoprotein, a cell membrane
      transporter, reported as two times higher in male livers than those of females.
      It has been reported that boys need a higher dose of 6-mercaptopurine, which is
      metabolized by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT is reported to be 14%
      higher in male human liver biopsies than those from females. Verapamil, a drug
      for angina and hypertension, has different clearance and side effects in men and 
      women. Ethnic/racial variations have also been demonstrated with the drug
      metabolizing enzymes, CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6.

      antiarrhythmic agents, 67% of those receiving sotalol, 79% of those receiving
      amiodarone, and 64% of those having electrical cardioversion. After adjusting for
      baseline characteristics and complications occurring before the onset of atrial
      fibrillation, there was no difference among the treatment groups in the incidence
      of sinus rhythm at the time of discharge or before deterioration to hospital
      death. However, the use of class I antiarrhythmic drugs or sotalol was associated
      with a lower unadjusted 30 day and one year mortality. After adjustment for
      baseline factors and pre-atrial fibrillation complications, the odds ratios for
      30 day and one year mortality were 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to
      0.89) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.04) with class I agents, and 0.31 (95% CI 0.07
      to 1.32) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.02) with sotalol. In contrast, there was no
      association between the use of amiodarone or electrical cardioversion and 30 day 
      or one year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There was a strong trend towards lower
      mortality associated with the use of class I antiarrhythmic agents or sotalol in 
      managing patients with atrial fibrillation after acute myocardial infarction.
      Randomised trials are indicated.

TI  - Oxidative stress and TGFbeta in kidney-transplanted patients with
      cyclosporin-induced hypertension. Effect of carvedilol and nifedipine.
PG  - 103-10
AB  - Cyclosporin is a powerful stimulator of oxidative stress signaling, leading to
      TGFbeta production, NO degradation, endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and
      post-transplant nephropathy. Carvedilol, alpha1-beta-blocker with strong
      antioxidant activity, may interfere with this chain of events. Therefore, we
      measured monocyte ecNOS, TGFbeta and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA level and
      plasma nitrite/nitrate, 3-nitrotyrosine, an estimate of peroxynitrite, and total 
      plasma antioxidant power in kidney-transplanted patients with post-transplant
      hypertension, before and after treatment with carvedilol, 25 - 50 mg o.d. orally 
      for 4 months (n = 15). The dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine (n 
      = 10) was used as comparator antihypertensive drug. Blood pressure fell to a
      similar extent with both drugs. Carvedilol increased plasma antioxidant power and
      HO-1 mRNA and reduced 3-nitrotyrosine and TGFbeta mRNA levels, while the same was
      not observed with nifedipine. Monocyte ec NOS mRNA levels and plasma
      nitrite/nitrate were higher in the patients than in a normotensive healthy
      control group and were unaffected by either treatment. In conclusion, carvedilol 
      reduces the oxidative stress and corrects the altered cellular signaling mediated
      by oxidative stress in CsA-induced post-transplant hypertension. Therefore, it
      may prevent long-term complications, such as endothelial dysfunction,
      fibrogenesis and post-transplant nephropathy by decreasing NO degradation and
      production of TGFbeta, a key fibrogenic cytokine, and by activating HO-1
      production.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of barnidipine compared with felodipine in the treatment of
      hypertension in Chinese patients.
PG  - 330-6
AB  - The efficacy and safety profiles of barnidipine in the treatment of hypertension 
      were evaluated in an open parallel-group study. Fifty-nine Chinese patients with 
      mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were randomized to receive either
      barnidipine or felodipine (5 mg once daily, titrated to 10 mg or 15 mg once
      daily, as indicated) for 12 weeks. Both drugs reduced blood pressures
      significantly with > or = 68% of cases obtaining marked or moderate blood
      pressure reduction. Mean reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure for 
      barnidipine treatment were 23.7 +/- 13.5 mmHg and 12.7 +/- 7.9 mmHg, and for
      felodipine, 24.3 +/- 18.4 mmHg and 14.5 +/- 10.0 mmHg, respectively. There was no
      significant difference between these two drugs in anti-hypertensive effect, heart
      rate, laboratory measurements or incidence of adverse events. The only difference
      was that more patients taking felodipine experienced palpitations. We conclude
      that barnidipine has similar efficacy and a similar safety profile to felodipine 
      in the treatment of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension in Chinese patients.

TI  - Improvement of endothelial function by amlodipine and vitamin C in essential
      hypertension.
PG  - 131-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of antihypertensive agents on endothelial function have
      not been fully evaluated in human hypertension and data on the forearm
      circulation of humans are controversial. The aim of this study was (1) to
      evaluate the endothelial function in hypertensive patients (2) to investigate
      whether vitamin C administration has any benefit on the endothelial function and 
      (3) to determine whether treatment with calcium antagonist improves endothelial
      dysfunction in hypertensive patients. METHODS: The endothelial function was
      estimated using venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP) in 8 hypertensive patients
      and 8 healthy volunteers. The patients in the hypertension group were treated
      with amlodipine, then examined again. The change of forearm blood flow (FBF) was 
      measured with acetylcholine infusion through brachial artery and also with
      intra-arterial vitamin C. RESULTS: Forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine
      was significantly enhanced with intra-arterial infusion of vitamin C in
      hypertensive group before antihypertensive treatment. Co-infusion of L-NMMA, an
      inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, blunted forearm blood flow response to
      acetylcholine. After treatment with amlodipine for 2 months in hypertensive
      group, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation to acetylcholine was significantly
      improved compared to pretreatment, and vitamin C did not affect the improved
      endothelial function by amlodipine treatment. CONCLUSION: Vitamin C (acutely) and
      amlodipine (chronically) improved endothelial function in hypertensive patients. 
      These results suggest that increased oxidative stress, at least in part, may be
      involved in the decreased endothelial function in hypertension.

TI  - Calcium channel blocker induced gingival overgrowth.
PG  - 310-1
AB  - Gingival overgrowth occurs with phenytoin, cyclosporin, and calcium antagonists. 
      It can be disfiguring and painful. The prevalence of gingival overgrowth with the
      use of calcium antagonists may be as high as 38%. The prevalence with nifedipine 
      may be greater than with other calcium blockers. Overgrowth occurs 3.3-times more
      commonly in men than in women. Plaque control is necessary. Some patients may
      require gingival surgery.

TI  - Should beta blockers be used in the treatment of hypertension in the elderly?
PG  - 286-94
AB  - The lack of benefit and the potential negative side effects of beta blockers are 
      overstated, especially in the elderly. This emphasis has led to recommendations
      by some investigators that these agents not be used in the management of
      hypertension in this age group. There are numerous reasons why these
      recommendations should not be followed. The use of beta blockers in the elderly
      hypertensive has resulted in a reduction in strokes and congestive heart failure.
      In addition, it should be emphasized that elderly patients are more likely to
      have silent coronary artery disease or sustain myocardial infarctions. There is
      abundant evidence that beta blockers are effective therapy in reducing mortality 
      once a myocardial infarction has occurred. In fact, there is a clear reduction in
      sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, national statistics document that elderly
      patients have a prevalence of congestive heart failure that varies from 6%-10%.
      Multiple studies have now documented that beta blockers are additive to
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing mortality for congestive
      heart failure. Thus, elderly hypertensive patients may benefit from the use of
      beta blockers, especially if there is evidence of ischemic heart disease, cardiac
      arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure.

TI  - Differential effects of a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor
      (temocapril) and a long-acting calcium antagonist (amlodipine) on ventricular
      ectopic beats in older hypertensive patients.
PG  - 329-33
AB  - We studied differences in the effects of a long-acting angiotensin-converting
      enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (temocapril) and a long-acting calcium channel blocker
      (amlodipine) on ventricular ectopic beats (VEB) in relation to sympathetic nerve 
      activity in 46 patients with essential hypertension. We performed 24-h Holter
      electrocardiography and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring simultaneously,
      and examined blood samples during the baseline, temocapril and amlodipine
      treatment periods. The ambulatory BP was lower in the amlodipine period than in
      the temocapril period. However, the number of VEB was significantly increased in 
      the amlodipine period compared to that in the baseline period (11.9 vs. 7.4/day, 
      p<0.05). In the temocapril period, the number of VEB was not significantly
      increased compared to that in the baseline period (8.6 vs. 7.4/day, p=0.30).
      Ambulatory heart rate (HR) was significantly increased in the amlodipine period
      compared to that in the baseline period (24-h HR: 70 vs. 66 bpm, p<0.001; daytime
      HR: 75 vs. 71 bpm, p<0.001; nocturnal HR: 60 vs. 58 bpm, p<0.05). Plasma
      norepinephrine (NE) also was significantly increased in the amlodipine period
      compared to that in the baseline period (457 vs. 369 pg/ml, p<0.001). However,
      when patients receiving amlodipine were divided into a high dose group (8.6 +/-
      1.2 mg/day) and a low dose group (4.6 +/- 1.2 mg/day), increases in HR and plasma
      NE levels were found only in the high dose group. These results indicate that
      amlodipine is effective at lowering BP in older hypertensives, although it may
      increase VEB, especially when given at a high dose.

TI  - The effects of amlodipine on cerebral circulatory values in patients with
      essential hypertension.
PG  - 14-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the effects of calcium channel blocker Amlodipine 
      on the cerebral circulation in patients with essential hypertension. METHODS:
      Cerebral circulation in 37 patients with essential hypertension and 10 healthy
      subjects was assessed using rheoplethysmography. In patients with essential
      hypertension cerebral circulation values were also re-estimated after treatment
      with Amlodipine (5-10 mg daily). RESULTS: The cerebral circulatory parameters in 
      hypertensive patients before treatment with Amlodipine were different from those 
      in healthy persons. Amlodipine along with the reduction in systemic blood
      pressure caused attenuation of cerebrovascular abnormalities: decrease in spastic
      signs and increase in cerebral blood supply in patients with essential
      hypertension. CONCLUSION: Amlodipine causes reduction of cerebral vascular
      resistance and promotes improvement in arterial blood filling in patients with
      essential hypertension. These changes in cerebral circulation may be secondary to
      the increase of cardiac output--known effect of Amlodipine.

TI  - Preventing drug-related morbidity--determining valid indicators.
PG  - 183-98
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the process that is being undertaken to validate a series 
      of indicators for preventable drug-related morbidity - originally developed in
      the US - for application in the UK health care system. DESIGN: A two-round Delphi
      questionnaire survey after a preliminary validation of the indicators within the 
      University of Manchester School of Pharmacy. SETTING: A primary care study set in
      the UK. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: A purposively selected sample of general
      practitioners with a specific responsibility for prescribing-related issues (n = 
      6) and pharmacists actively involved in medication review in primary care (n =
      10). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The establishment of consensus among the participants
      that an indicator reflected preventable drug-related morbidity in primary care.
      RESULTS: After preliminary validation, 37 of the original 57 US indicators were
      retained. The Delphi panel generated 16 additional new indicators in the first
      round. At the end of the second round, the pre-defined level of consensus was
      reached for 29 indicators (19 of the US generated indicators; 10 generated by the
      panel in the first round). CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi results highlighted
      differences in both the clinical perspective and, possibly, philosophical
      viewpoints of health professionals practising in the UK and US health care
      systems. Further work, located in both primary and secondary care, is now in
      progress to operationalize the indicators. This process will form a key part of
      the refining, and hence further validation, of the indicators. The future
      development of prospective medical-record-based indicators should facilitate a
      reduction in the human, clinical, and economic burden of drug-related morbidity.

TI  - Cardiac and renal effects of standard versus rigorous blood pressure control in
      autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease: results of a seven-year prospective
      randomized study.
PG  - 1733-9
AB  - This study sought to investigate the cardiac and renal effects of rigorous versus
      standard BP control on autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). A
      prospective, randomized, 7-yr study was performed to examine the effect of
      rigorous (<120/80 mmHg) versus standard (135-140/85-90 mmHg) BP control on left
      ventricular mass index (LVMI) and kidney function in 75 hypertensive ADPKD
      patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. LVMI was measured by echocardiogram
      at baseline and at 1 and 7 yr. Renal function was assessed by measuring serum
      creatinine and 24-h creatinine clearance every 6 mo for 3 yr, then annually for
      an additional 4 yr. The baseline characteristics were comparable in the two
      groups. During the study, average mean arterial pressure was 90 +/- 5 mmHg for
      the rigorous group and 101 +/- 4 mmHg for the standard group (P < 0.0001). The
      LVMI decreased by 21% in the standard group and by 35% in the rigorous group. A
      mixed model longitudinal data analysis revealed that rigorous BP control was
      significantly more effective in decreasing LVMI (P < 0.01). There was no
      statistically significant difference in renal function between the two groups. In
      conclusion, left ventricular hypertrophy, a major cardiovascular risk factor, was
      decreased to a significantly greater extent by rigorous than standard BP control.
      This finding has particular clinical importance because cardiovascular
      complications are the most common cause of death in ADPKD patients.

TI  - Prospective controlled trial of two nifedipine extended release formulations in
      the treatment of essential hypertension.
PG  - 379-84
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacodynamic equivalence of two
      different slow-release formulations of nifedipine (CAS-21829-25-4). In a
      prospective, controlled, double-blind clinical trial, 42 patients with essential 
      hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 95-114 mmHg) underwent an
      initial washout, drug free period of 2 weeks, after which they were randomized to
      receive either 30 mg of nifedipine in the test preparation "XL" (Nifecard) or 30 
      mg of nifedipine in a reference formulation, "LA", during six weeks. The response
      to treatment was assessed by measuring the blood pressure (BP) every two weeks
      (standard office mercury sphygmomanometry) and by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure 
      monitoring (ABPM). Of the 42 included patients 36 (85.5%) completed the trial: 19
      on "XL" and 17 on "LA". After 2 weeks of therapy the DBP decreased by about 11%
      (-13.4 mmHg) and 10% (-9.5%), respectively, after 4 weeks the mean decrease
      versus the end of the placebo period reached about 14% (-15.5 mmHg) and 11% (-13 
      mmHg), and at the end of the trial the DBPs were lower by about 13% (-14.5 mmHg) 
      in both groups. In all these measurements the within group differences were
      significant (p < 0.001), while the between groups differences were not (p >
      0.05). Quite comparable results were obtained with ABPM, e.g. in the "XL" group
      the systolic blood pressure at the end of the study was lower by 12.3% (-4.6 mm
      Hg) and in the "LA" group, by 10.6% (-9.0 mm Hg); p = 0.358. The adverse effects 
      were similar in both groups and they required neither particular interventions
      nor withdrawal from the study. The drugs under study were comparably effective
      and well tolerated antihypertensives.

TI  - The effect of antihypertensive drugs on the fetus.
PG  - 293-8
AB  - A critical review of the literature on the effects of antihypertensive drugs on
      the fetus in pregnant women is presented. The survey covers the alpha-adrenergic 
      receptor agonists, beta-blockers including topical eye medications, alpha-beta
      blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors. The lack of data on angiotensin II receptor blockers is noted
      although effects are considered to be similar to those reported with ACE
      inhibitors and therefore to be avoided. Analysis of the literature underscores
      that some antihypertensive drugs can be used safely at certain stages of
      pregnancy, while others are suspect and to be avoided at all costs. The lack of
      placebo-controlled studies on the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy
      due to ethical considerations is discussed against the background of the pressing
      need to treat these women despite the possible deleterious effects of
      antihypertensive drugs.

TI  - A comparison between the effects of diltiazem and isosorbide dinitrate on digoxin
      pharmacodynamics and kinetics in the treatment of patients with chronic ischemic 
      heart failure.
PG  - 725-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an arteriolar dilator (diltiazem
      hydrochloride) versus a venodilator (isosorbide dinitrate) on digoxin kinetics
      and to estimate the efficacy and tolerability of these vasodilators when combined
      with digoxin for 10 days therapy in patients with congestive heart failure
      secondary to ischemic heart disease. METHODS: A double blind randomized cross
      over study was carried out to investigate the effect of an arteriolar dilator
      (diltiazem hydrochloride 180 mg/day orally) versus a venodilator (isosorbide
      dinitrate 30 mg/day orally) on digoxin kinetics (0.25 mg/day orally), after 10
      days therapy in patients with heart failure due to ischemic heart disease. Also, 
      the effect of these drugs on blood pressure, heart rate, renal functions and
      serum electrolytes, and their efficacy and tolerability in combination with
      digoxin were studied. This study was carried out in the Department of Medicine,
      Main Alexandria University Hospital, Alexandria, Egypt, during the period May
      1999 through to May 2000. RESULTS: Diltiazem caused a significant increase in
      digoxin maximum serum concentration without significant change in time to reach
      maximum concentration and the apparent volume of distribution. The total digoxin 
      clearance was significantly reduced and the elimination half life was prolonged. 
      Subsequently the area under time-concentration curve and the steady-state digoxin
      level were increased, but were still within therapeutic margin. On the other hand
      isosorbide dinitrate significantly increased digoxin maximum serum concentration 
      but without change in the other digoxin pharmacokinetic parameters. Isosorbide
      dinitrate, but not diltiazem, caused significant reduction in supine and standing
      blood pressure, while both drugs did not significantly alter pulse rate, renal
      functions, serum sodium potassium and electrocardiographic pattern. CONCLUSION:
      Patients who received diltiazem displayed a mean 51% increase in the area under
      the plasma concentration-time curve, 50% increase in mean steady state serum
      digoxin concentration, and 37% increase in peak serum digoxin concentration.
      While patients who received isosorbide dinitrate showed only a 15% increase in
      digoxin maximum serum concentration and no statistically significant change in
      mean steady state digoxin concentration or area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve. The elimination half life during the diltiazem phase
      was prolonged by 29% while there was no significant change with isosorbide
      dinitrate. Netiher diltiazem or isosorbide dinitrate significantly altered the
      time to reach maximum serum digoxin concentration. The addition of a vasodilator 
      such as, diltiazem or isosorbid dinitrate to digoxin could significantly improve 
      the symptoms and signs of heart failure compared to digoxin alone. They were well
      tolerated and without fear of electrolyte imbalance which potentiate digoxin
      toxicity.

TI  - Adverse drug events in hospitalized patients treated with cardiovascular drugs
      and anticoagulants.
PG  - 235-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence of serious adverse drug events (ADEs) caused
      by cardiovascular drugs during hospitalization in a department of internal
      medicine, and to identify patients at highest risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All the
      patients treated with cardiovascular drugs and/or anticoagulants in the
      department between November 1999 and January 2000 were recruited into the study. 
      During hospitalization the patients' charts were reviewed by a pharmacist and a
      clinician, and the occurrence of serious ADEs was assessed using the Naranjo
      algorithm. 'Possible' and 'doubtful' ADEs were not counted. RESULTS: Of 496
      patients who were enrolled in the study, 20 (4%) had serious ADEs. Compared to
      patients without ADEs, patients in the ADE group were older (72 +/- 12.6 years
      (mean +/- SD) vs. 65 +/- 13 years, p = 0.048), their average stay in hospital was
      longer (7.3 +/- 5.5 days vs. 5.2 +/- 3.7 days, p = 0.018) and their mean urea
      levels were higher (10.8 +/- 9.3 mmol/l vs. 7.8 +/- 5.3 mmol/l, p = 0.027). The
      most frequent background pathologies of the 20 patients with ADEs were
      hypertension (in 18 (90%)) and atrial fibrillation (in nine (45%)). In 50% of the
      the ADE group there was a history of drug allergies. The ADEs recorded were
      bleeding in four (20%), arrhythmias in six (30%), orthostatic hypotension in six 
      (30%) and skin necrosis, paranoid reaction, acute hepatitis and acute renal
      failure in four (20%). The causative drugs were warfarin (which accounted for 25%
      of the ADEs), beta-blockers (15%), propafenone (5%), amiodarone (5%), and
      Ca(2+)-channel blockers, nitrates and diuretics (together accounting for 50% of
      ADEs). Drug combinations were implicated in 50% of ADE. CONCLUSIONS: Serious ADEs
      were developed by 4% of hospitalized patients taking cardiovascular drugs. Those 
      at highest risk were older, were receiving multiple drug therapy and had higher
      urea levels. Warfarin and beta-blockers were the drugs causing the largest number
      of adverse effects. ADEs are an important cause of preventable morbidity, often
      with serious economic implications and special attention should be given to their
      prevention.

TI  - Effects of intravenous amlodipine on coronary hemodynamics in subjects with
      angiographically normal coronary arteries.
PG  - 884-91
AB  - The aim of the current study was to assess the ability of amlodipine to dilate
      the coronary vessels in subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries
      and normal left ventricular function. Ten patients, six women and four men (mean 
      age 48 +/- 14 years, range 25-67 years) were enrolled. Coronary flow velocity and
      coronary perfusion pressure were invasively measured at baseline, during
      intracoronary adenosine (1-mg bolus) and at 5, 15, and 30 min following IV
      amlodipine (10 or 20 mg). Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at
      baseline and at 5, 15, and 30 min after amlodipine. Coronary cross-sectional area
      and mean coronary flow velocity progressively increased after amlodipine
      administration, resulting in an average increase in coronary flow at 30 min of
      76%. On an individual basis, all patients but one showed a consistent trend
      toward a progressive coronary vasodilator effect of amlodipine over time. The
      peak effect of amlodipine on baseline mean coronary flow velocity was 43 +/- 12% 
      that of adenosine. This is the first clinical study demonstrating that the IV
      administration of amlodipine produces a powerful coronary vasodilatation in
      subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries and normal ventricular
      function, besides its known systemic vasodilating effects. The coronary
      vasodilating properties of amlodipine are particularly expressed at the
      microcirculatory level.

TI  - Adverse drug reactions as a cause for admissions to a department of internal
      medicine.
PG  - 65-72
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the occurrence and pattern of adverse drug reactions as a
      cause for acute hospital admission. METHODS: In 681 randomly selected patients,
      acutely admitted to a clinic of internal medicine at a Swedish university
      hospital, information was collected from their medical records about current
      symptoms and use of drugs, previous diseases and the results of medical
      investigations and tests. In addition, a standardized interview according to a
      questionnaire was carried out. A group of experts in clinical pharmacology
      assessed the data obtained from the patients' case records and the results of the
      interviews, and then, according to WHO criteria, judged the probability that an
      adverse drug reaction could have caused or contributed to the actual admission to
      hospital. RESULTS: Out of the 681 cases included, 94 (13.8%) had symptoms and
      signs that were judged as drug-related and that had caused or contributed to the 
      admission. Eighty-two patients (12.0%) had altogether 99 symptoms that were
      classified as adverse drug reactions. Of these, 91% were type A reactions. The
      relationship between the medication and the reaction was judged certain in eight,
      probable in 17, and possible in 74 cases. The most common adverse drug reactions 
      were cardiovascular (36.3%). Twelve patients (1.8%) had symptoms indicating
      intoxications. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of drug-related problems causing or
      contributing to admission to a clinic of internal medicine is high and is
      dominated by type A reactions, i.e. reactions in principle predictable and
      preventable. This implies a possibility to increase drug safety by preventive
      measures.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 91-101
AB  - The prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation increase with age. Atrial
      fibrillation is associated with a higher incidence of coronary events, stroke,
      and mortality than sinus rhythm. A fast ventricular rate associated with atrial
      fibrillation may cause tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Management of atrial
      fibrillation includes treatment of underlying causes and precipitating factors.
      Immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed in persons with atrial
      fibrillation associated with acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to
      myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous
      beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem may be used to immediately slow a fast
      ventricular rate associated with atrial fibrillation. An oral beta-blocker,
      verapamil, or diltiazem should be given to persons with atrial fibrillation if a 
      rapid ventricular rate occurs a rest or during exercise despite digoxin.
      Amiodarone may be used in selected persons with symptomatic life-threatening
      atrial fibrillation refractory to other drug therapy. Nondrug therapies should be
      performed in persons with symptomatic atrial fibrillation in whom a rapid
      ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drug therapy. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
      associated with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome should be managed with a
      permanent pacemaker in combination with drugs. A permanent pacemaker should be
      implanted in persons with atrial fibrillation in whom symptoms such as dizziness 
      or syncope associated with non-drug-induced ventricular pauses longer than 3
      seconds develop. Elective direct-current cardioversion has a higher success rate 
      and a lower incidence of cardiac adverse effects than medical cardioversion in
      converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Unless transesophageal
      echocardiography shows no thrombus in the left atrial appendage before
      cardioversion, oral warfarin should be given for 3 weeks before elective
      direct-current or drug cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and continued for at 
      least 4 weeks after maintenance of sinus rhythm. Many cardiologists prefer the
      treatment strategy of ventricular rate control plus warfarin rather than to
      maintain sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs, especially in older patients.
      Digoxin should not be used in persons with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
      Patients with chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who are at high risk for 
      stroke should be treated with long-term warfarin to achieve an International
      Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. Persons with atrial fibrillation who are at
      low risk for stroke or who have contraindications to warfarin should receive 325 
      mg aspirin daily.

TI  - Severity of hypertension affects improved resistance artery endothelial function 
      by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.
PG  - 668-76
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the
      restoration of endothelial function by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition
      based on the severity of hypertension. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured in
      69 patients with essential hypertension (mild, n = 23; moderate, n = 29; and
      severe, n = 17 randomly assigned to treatment with either imidapril or amlodipine
      for 24 weeks in a double-blind fashion during reactive hyperemia and after
      sublingual administration of nitroglycerin. Imidapril augmented the FBF response 
      to reactive hyperemia after 24 weeks of treatment in the mild and moderate
      hypertensive groups, but not in the severe hypertensive group. The augmentation
      of the FBF response to reactive hyperemia induced by imidapril was significantly 
      greater in the moderate hypertensive group than in the mild hypertensive group.
      Amlodipine did not alter the FBF response to reactive hyperemia. The increase in 
      FBF after the sublingually administered nitroglycerin was similar in all groups. 
      The infusion of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor,
      abolished the enhancement of reactive hyperemia in the mild and moderate
      hypertensive groups treated with imidapril. These findings suggest that the
      effects of imidapril on endothelial function are affected by the severity of
      hypertension and that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced
      augmentation of reactive hyperemia may be due to increased nitric oxide
      production.

TI  - Effects of chronic calcium channel blockade on sympathetic nerve activity in
      hypertension.
PG  - 892-6
AB  - The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is an important regulator of the
      circulation. Its activity is increased in hypertension and heart failure and
      adversely affects prognosis. Although certain drugs inhibit SNS, dihydropyridine 
      calcium antagonists may stimulate the system. Phenylalkylamine calcium
      antagonists such as verapamil have a different pharmacological profile. We
      therefore tested the hypothesis of whether amlodipine, nifedipine, or verapamil
      differs in the effects on muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSA). Forty-three
      patients (31 men, 12 women) with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly
      assigned to 1 drug for 8 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, and MSA (by
      microneurography) were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. All
      calcium antagonists led to a similar decrease in blood pressure of 5.0+/-1.5 to
      6.4+/-1.4 mm Hg at 8 weeks (P<0.001 versus baseline). There were no significant
      differences in MSA between groups. With amlodipine, MSA averaged 49+/-3
      bursts/min (3 versus baseline); with nifedipine, 48+/-3 bursts/min (2 versus
      baseline); and with verapamil, 49+/-2 bursts/min (all, P=NS). With verapamil,
      norepinephrine decreased by 4% but tended to increase by about one third with
      amlodipine or nifedipine (P=NS). Thus, in hypertension slow release forms of
      verapamil, nifedipine, and amlodipine exert comparable antihypertensive effects
      and do not change MSA, although there was a trend toward decreased MSA and plasma
      norepinephrine with verapamil.

TI  - Effect of calcium channel antagonist diltiazem and calcium ionophore A23187 on
      cyclosporine A-induced apoptosis of renal tubular cells.
PG  - 191-6
AB  - Calcium channel antagonists have been reported to have a favorable impact on
      cyclosporin A (CsA)-treated kidney transplant recipients. However, it is not
      clear whether this is because of their direct effect on antagonizing the toxicity
      of CsA to renal tubular cells. In this study, we have used Madin-Darby canine
      kidney tubular cells as a model to examine the effect of diltiazem, a calcium
      channel antagonist, on CsA-induced apoptosis. Moreover, to investigate the
      possible regulation of CsA cytotoxicity by intracellular calcium level, the
      effect of the calcium ionophore A23187 on CsA-induced apoptosis was also
      examined. We found that treatment of CsA (20 microM) alone caused 20-30% cell
      death, which was apparently (30-40%) enhanced by diltiazem at 100 microg/ml,
      accompanied by more severe DNA fragmentation, activation of caspases, and a
      decreased level of Bcl-2. The caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk or Bcl-2 overexpression 
      was capable of suppressing apoptosis induced by the synergistic effect of
      diltiazem and CsA. Moreover, the survival rate of cells treated with CsA (30
      microM) alone remained only 30%, however, it was markedly (approximately 40%)
      elevated by co-treatment with A23187 (75 ng/ml). The rescue of cells from
      CsA-induced apoptosis by A23187 was correlated with AKT activation, BAD
      phosphorylation, and caspase-3 inactivation. Taken together, our results suggest 
      that the reported favorable impact of diltiazem on kidney grafts is likely not
      because of its direct protection on renal tubular cells. Instead, it enhances the
      toxicity of CsA to renal tubular cells. In addition, our findings raise a
      possibility that the intracellular calcium level and the AKT pathway may
      participate in the regulation of CsA cytotoxicity.

TI  - Antiarrhythmic effects of azimilide in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia:
      efficacy and dose-response.
PG  - 643-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Azimilide is a novel classification III antiarrhythmic agent that
      blocks both I(Kr)and I(Ks)and shows evidence of efficacy in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation or flutter. Its effect on paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
      (PSVT) has not been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred ninety-three
      patients with symptomatic PSVT were enrolled in 4 double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled clinical trials with almost identical trial design
      (supraventricular arrhythmia-1 [SVA-1], SVA-2, SVA-3, and SVA-4), performed as a 
      separate stratum of studies that also included a stratum of patients with atrial 
      fibrillation or flutter. Patients received oral azimilide (100 mg in SVA-1 and
      SVA-3, 35 or 75 mg in SVA-2, and 125 mg in SVA-4) or matching placebo twice daily
      for 3 days (loading period), followed by once-daily dosing (maintenance period). 
      The primary outcome variable was the first recording of a symptomatic
      supraventricular arrhythmia (either PSVT, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter)
      recorded on a transtelephonic electrocardiographic event recorder. The duration
      of study was 270 days in SVA-1 and SVA-2 and 180 days in SVA-3 and SVA-4.
      Combined analysis results of the PSVT stratum from the 4 studies showed a
      dose-response relationship in prolongation of time to recurrence (P =.02). In the
      combined 100-mg daily dose, the hazard ratio (placebo:azimilide) was 2.35 (P
      =.023). The hazard ratio for the 125-mg daily dose measured 1.28 (P = not
      significant). However, the time to recurrence was prolonged when the patients
      receiving 100 and 125 mg daily were combined and compared with placebo (P =.02). 
      There were no deaths and 1 case of torsades de pointes. CONCLUSION: These trial
      results suggest a significant dose-related suppression of PSVT with azimilide,
      with a low risk of serious adverse events.

TI  - A randomised trial to compare the efficacy and safety of Felodipine (Plendil) and
      Nifedipine (Adalat) retard in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.
PG  - 196-202
AB  - The efficacy and tolerability of Felodipine extended-release was compared with
      Nifedipine retard in the management of patients with mild-to-moderate
      hypertension. A total of one hundred and thirty three patients were screened out 
      of which one hundred and twenty-one patients were enrolled in a 9-week
      multicentre open, randomised rising-dose trial to receive either Felodipine 5-10 
      mg once daily or Nifedipine 10-20 mg twice daily. Blood pressure was measured at 
      the end of the dosing interval that is 24 hours and 12 hours after Felodipine and
      Nifedipine respectively. Both drugs, Felodipine and Nifedipine were found to
      lower blood pressure significantly compared with baseline. After three weeks of
      treatment, seated blood pressure was reduced by 20/14 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)
      and by 24/16 mmHg after 6 weeks in the felodipine group. Corresponding values in 
      the Nifedipine group were 16/09 mmHg and 24/13mmHg. Pulse rate was not
      significantly affected by either drugs. The percentage of patients who had
      satisfactory control after 3 weeks treatment was 57.6% for Felodipine and 33.3%
      for Nifedipine (significant). After dose titration (where necessary), at the end 
      of the study the response rates were 76.3% (n=45) and 79.6% (n=43) for Felodipine
      and Nifedipine respectively (non significant). Both drugs were metabolically
      inert and did not derange the haematologic and biochemical profile of patients.
      They produced no significant weight changes. The pattern of side effects were
      similar in both groups but tended to be more severe with Nifedipine necessitating
      withdrawal of two patients in this group. In conclusion, Felodipine ER 5mg - 10mg
      once daily, and Nifedipine Retard, 20mg twice daily were equally effective
      medications for mild-to-moderate hypertension but Felodipine was better
      tolerated.

TI  - Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure in the International Nifedipine GITS
      Study Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT).
PG  - 545-53
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The International Nifedipine GITS Study Intervention as a Goal in
      Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) showed, by means of office blood pressure
      measurements, that long-term treatment with nifedipine GITS is as effective as
      diuretics in preventing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications.
      However, since office blood pressure measurements reflect to a limited extent
      blood pressure outside the office, a side-arm INSIGHT study in which patients
      underwent both office measurement and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      was also performed. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study had a randomized, double-blind,
      parallel group design. After 4 weeks of placebo, mild-to-moderate essential
      hypertensive patients were randomized to nifedipine GITS 30 mg or amiloride 2.5 +
      hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg for 3.1 years. Dose titration was performed by dose
      doubling and addition of atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg, or other drugs
      when needed. Analysis was carried out by intention-to-treat and included
      computation of 24 h, day and night ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate
      values. Additional analyses included computation of the trough-to-peak ratio and 
      the smoothness index (the ratio between the average of the 24-hourly blood
      pressure reductions after treatment and its standard deviation). RESULTS: A total
      of 151 patients were recruited and 149 were valid for analysis: 78 patients had
      24 h ambulatory recordings both at baseline and during treatment and 134 during
      treatment. Office, 24 h and day and night blood pressures were all significantly 
      and similarly reduced by both treatments. Office and ambulatory heart rate was
      left unchanged by diuretics, while it was slightly reduced by nifedipine. Median 
      trough-to-peak ratios were always > 0.5 and superimposable between the two
      treatment groups. Similarly, smoothness indices of systolic and diastolic blood
      pressures were comparably high for nifedipine and diuretics, thus demonstrating a
      similar well-balanced antihypertensive response to both drugs. No significant
      differences were observed between the two treatment groups in the number of
      cardiovascular events (17 in the nifedipine-based and 26 in the diuretics-based
      treatment group). CONCLUSIONS: In the INSIGHT study, the long-term
      antihypertensive effect on 24 h blood pressure and the cardiovascular protection 
      of nifedipine was similar to that of diuretics.

AB  - A granuloma annulare-like drug reaction is a rarely encountered clinical entity. 
      A 64-year-old Caucasian female developed a granuloma annulare-like reaction 13
      days after starting amlodipine and cleared within 3 months after drug cessation. 
      The eruption consisted of multiple erythematous pruritic papules, distributed
      symmetrically over the lateral aspects of the legs and thighs, as well as on both
      palms. Histology showed focal collagen degeneration and significant interstitial

      previously reported cases of granuloma annulare-like drug reactions, in the
      context of a recently proposed classification for drug-induced interstitial
      granulomatous reactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The goals of the present study were: a) to identify and characterize 
      drug-related problems (adverse drug reactions, non-compliance and intentional
      overdose) leading to admissions to our hospital (Hospital Clinic) through the
      Emergency Department, b) to know the most frequently involved medications, c) to 
      identify risk factors for hospital admissions due to drug-related problems, and
      d) to determine the avoidability of these admissions. PATIENTS AND METHOD:
      Prospective study carried out from August 1999 to November 1999 and from January 
      2000 to May 2000. The study included 1,800 admissions corresponding to 1,663
      patients. RESULTS: Including definitive, probable and possible cases, 215
      hospital admissions (11.9%) were drug-related ones. Of these cases, 108 (50.2%)
      corresponded to adverse drug reactions, 100 (46.5%) to dose-related therapeutic
      failures (mainly non-compliance) and 7 (3.3%) corresponded to intentional
      overdose. When 'possible' cases were excluded in order to achieve a better
      defined causative relationship, drug-related admissions dropped to 139 (7.7%).
      According to Schumock and Thornton criteria, 68.4% hospital admissions due to
      drug-related problems were considered 'avoidable'. Most avoidable admissions were
      due to non-compliance, absence of preventive therapy and inappropriate
      monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admissions due to drug-related problems are
      frequent and often preventable.

TI  - Delirium in the intensive care unit: are we helping the patient?
PG  - 47-60
AB  - The intensive care unit (ICU) represents a dynamic interaction between patient
      factors and interventional factors. The complexity of this situation can generate
      an impaired consciousness in the patients. The critical care provider is faced
      with deducing the etiology and treatment of delirium in the ICU. Many of the
      therapeutic agents that are used in the ICU may precipitate delirium. Patients
      may also experience delirium as part of their underlying medical conditions.
      Withdrawal syndromes, delirium tremens in particular, are known to cause
      delirium. By a combination of appropriate selection of medications and an
      awareness of delirium as a side effect, the patient in the ICU may be treated in 
      a manner to minimize the clouding of consciousness. An understanding of the
      proposed pathophysiology of various types of delirium will allow appropriate
      clinical measures to be taken.

TI  - Comparative study of calcium-channel blockers on cell proliferation, DNA and
      collagen syntheses, and EGF receptors of cultured gingival fibroblasts derived
      from human nifedipine, nicardipine and nisoldipine responders.
PG  - 261-8
AB  - Our previous study indicated that fibroblasts derived from patients reactive to
      nifedipine might be susceptible to the other calcium-channel blockers
      (nicardipine, verapamil and diltiazem) in terms of cell proliferation, DNA
      synthesis, and collagen synthesis. Thus, the present investigation was designed
      to clarify the cross-reactivity among dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers
      (nifedipine, nicardipine, and nisoldipine). Human gingival fibroblasts derived
      from seven, two, and one patients who developed gingival overgrowth as a result
      of nifedipine, nicardipine, and nisoldipine medications, respectively, were
      examined in terms of the effect of calcium-channel blockers (nifedipine,
      diltiazem, verapamil, and nicardipine) on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis,
      collagen synthesis, and the number of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors.
      Phenytoin was used as a positive control. With most of the calcium-channel
      blockers and phenytoin, fibroblasts from patients reactive to nifedipine and
      nicardipine medications gave a better cell proliferation rate, DNA synthesis, and
      an increased number of EGF receptors, compared to non-drug-treated control.
      However, this was not the case for calcium-channel blockers tested in fibroblasts
      from patients reactive to nisoldipine medication.

TI  - Slow-infusion of calcium channel blockers in the emergency management of
      supraventricular tachycardia.
PG  - 167-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of verapamil and diltiazem as slow infusions
      in terminating spontaneous supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in the emergency
      department (ED). METHOD: Patients of at least 10 years of age who presented to
      our ED with regular narrow complex tachycardia not converted with a vagal
      manoeuvre with an ECG diagnosis of SVT were included. Those who were
      haemodynamically unstable were excluded. Patients were randomized to undergo
      either verapamil infusion at a rate of 1 mg/min to a maximum of 20 mg or
      diltiazem infusion at a rate of 2.5 mg/min to a maximum of 50 mg. RESULTS:
      Eighty-one patients were randomized to receive verapamil infusion and 80 were
      randomized to receive the diltiazem infusion. There is no difference in success
      rate between verapamil (98.8%) and diltiazem (96.3%) infusion. The dose of
      medication required to convert 25,50 and 75% of SVTs were 4.0,5.0 and 8.0 mg for 
      the verapamil infusion and 10.0,12.5 and 17.5 mg for the diltiazem infusion.
      There was one complication in each group. CONCLUSION: Calcium channel blockers
      infusions were safe and efficacious in terminating spontaneous SVT. There was no 
      difference between the success rates of verapamil and diltiazem infusions.

TI  - A comparative trial of controlled-onset, extended-release verapamil, enalapril,
      and losartan on blood pressure and heart rate changes.
PG  - 53-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excess morning risk of myocardial infarction and stroke may be
      attributable to the rapid rise in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in the hours
      after awakening. The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 
      multicenter study was to compare once-daily, controlled-onset, extended-release
      (COER-24) verapamil to enalapril and losartan on BP and heart rate during the
      postawakening morning phase as well as throughout the 24-h period. METHODS: A
      total of 406 patients were randomized to an 8-week forced-titration period with
      one of the following: 1) COER-24 verapamil 240 mg/day titrated to 360 mg/day; 2) 
      enalapril 10 mg/day titrated to 20 mg/day, 3) losartan 50 mg/day titrated to 100 
      mg/day, or 4) placebo. Office BP and heart rate and ambulatory 24-h BP monitoring
      was performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Each active treatment, 
      as compared with placebo, lowered BP both during the morning hours as well as the
      entire 24-h period. COER-24 verapamil was more effective in lowering morning
      systolic (-16.6 mm Hg) and diastolic (-11.9 mm Hg) BP than either enalapril or
      losartan (P < .001). For the entire 24-h period, the effects of COER-24 verapamil
      (-11.6/-8.4 mm Hg) were comparable to enalapril (- 13.4/-8.3 mm Hg; P = NS).
      Losartan achieved a similar 24-h effect on systolic pressure (-9.3 mm Hg) but was
      less effective on diastolic pressure (-5.4 mm Hg; P = .004 v COER-verapamil).
      Unlike losartan or enalapril, COER-24 verapamil was the only treatment to lower
      the heart rate over both the 24-h period (-4.6 beats/min; P < .001) and during
      waking hours (-4.6 beats/min; P < .001). A blunted rate of rise in BP, heart
      rate, and rate-pressure product occurred during the postawakening period with
      COER-verapamil (P = .03) but not with either of the other treatment arms. Lastly,
      the decline in BP at night was similar for COER-verapamil and losartan and
      greater with enalapril (P = .014) CONCLUSIONS: COER-24 verapamil produces changes
      in BP and pulse that more closely match the normal circadian hemodynamic rhythms 
      than either do enalapril or losartan.

TI  - Amlodipine versus chlorthalidone versus placebo in the treatment of stage I
      isolated systolic hypertension.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - The study was to compare the effects of amlodipine (calcium channel antagonist), 
      chlorthalidone (diuretic), and placebo in adults more than 50 years of age with
      stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). After a 4-week placebo run-in
      phase, 150 patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to treatment
      with 5 mg of amlodipine (n = 48), 15 mg of chlorthalidone (n = 50), or placebo (n
      = 52). Patients who failed to meet the systolic blood pressure (BP) reduction
      goal by week 4 had their dose increased to 10 mg of amlodipine or 30 mg of
      chlorthalidone, and maintained at this increased dose for 12 weeks. Results
      showed a mean reduction (mean +/- SD) in sitting systolic BP from baseline to the
      last treatment visit of -14.6+/-12.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI] -18.2,
      -11.0), -14.0+/-13.46 mm Hg (95% CI -17.8, -10.2), and -3.4+/-11.83 mm Hg (95% CI
      -6.7, -0.1) for the amlodipine, chlorthalidone, and the placebo treatment groups,
      respectively. Both active treatments showed significantly greater reductions than
      the placebo group (P < or = .001), but were not significantly different from each
      other. Sixty-seven percent of the amlodipine, 69% of the chlorthalidone, and 25% 
      of the placebo-treated patients reached the protocol defined systolic BP goal (P 
      = .001). Both active treatment groups showed a trend of better systolic BP
      response in older patients (> or =65 years). Secondary efficacy measures
      including pulse pressure, standing systolic, diastolic, and the 24-h ambulatory
      BP were also statistically significantly improved for both active treatments at
      the end of treatment, except for chlorthalidone in standing diastolic BP. Adverse
      events that occurred during the study were as expected and were well tolerated.
      The results of this study support the efficacy and safety of amlodipine and
      chlorthalidone for the treatment of stage 1 ISH during 20 weeks of treatment.

TI  - Persistence of antihypertensive efficacy after missed doses: comparison of
      amlodipine and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system.
PG  - 333-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, the
      antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine and nifedipine gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system (GITS) was compared following missed doses. Design and methods
      In a randomized crossover design, 42 patients were randomized to receive
      amlodipine (5-10 mg) or the GITS formulation of nifedipine (nifedipine GITS)
      (30-60 mg) once daily for 12 weeks, then vice versa. During weeks 8, 10 and 12 of
      each treatment period, compliance failures were simulated by patients missing 0, 
      1 or 2 doses of their medication, and ambulatory systolic (SBP) and diastolic
      (DBP) blood pressure measurements were obtained. RESULTS: Following steady-state 
      treatment (i.e. 'perfect compliance'), there was no difference between amlodipine
      and nifedipine GITS in SBP (140.1 versus 134.2 mmHg) or DBP (84.0 versus 85.8
      mmHg) at 0-24 h post-dose. When compliance was not perfect, i.e. when one or two 
      doses were missed, DBP was maintained at a significantly lower level with
      amlodipine compared with nifedipine GITS at 24-48 h post-dose (83.1 versus 86.4
      mmHg, P = 0.005) and at 48-72 h post-dose (84.2 versus 89.7 mmHg, P < 0.001).
      Plasma concentrations of amlodipine were better maintained than those of
      nifedipine GITS. At 72 h post-dose, the plasma concentration of amlodipine was
      61% (17.0 +/- 11.2 ng/ml) compared with < 25% (28.3 +/- 49.9 ng/ml) for
      nifedipine GITS. CONCLUSION: During short periods of non-compliance,
      antihypertensive efficacy remains more predictable with amlodipine than with
      nifedipine GITS.

TI  - Changes in renal resistive index and urinary albumin excretion in hypertensive
      patients under long-term treatment with lisinopril or nifedipine GITS.
PG  - 169-73
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increased renal vascular resistance and microalbuminuria are
      associated with hypertensive target organ damage and may be predictors of
      hypertensive nephrosclerosis. AIM: We investigated changes in renal resistive
      index (RI) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in a group of patients with
      primary hypertension before and during long-term antihypertensive treatment.
      METHODS: Thirty-two patients were randomized to receive antihypertensive
      treatment with either a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine GITS, up to 90
      mg/day, n = 16) or an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril, up to 20 mg/day, n = 16), alone 
      or in association with a diuretic (chlortalidone, 25 mg/day). Blood pressure,
      renal resistive index (by US Doppler) and UAE (mean of three nonconsecutive timed
      urinary collections, microg/min) were evaluated at baseline and over the course
      of 24 months of treatment. RESULTS: Both regimens effectively lowered blood
      pressure (mean blood pressure from 123 +/- 1.8 at baseline to 103 +/- 1.5 mm Hg
      at 24 months in the lisinopril group and from 122 +/- 1.9 at baseline to 104 +/- 
      0.8 at 24 months in the nifedipine group, p < 0.001 for both groups). Overall,
      blood pressure decrease was associated with a reduction in UAE and no change in
      RI throughout the study. However, despite similar blood pressure reduction, the
      two regimens showed different specific effects. Lisinopril was associated with a 
      significant decrease in both UAE (33.8 +/- 16.2 at baseline and 9.1 +/- 2.1 at 24
      months, p < 0.01) and renal RI (0.61 +/- 0.02 at baseline and 0.56 +/- 0.04 at 24
      months, p < 0.05) while nifedipine GITS did not significantly influence UAE (35.7
      +/- 12.2 at baseline and 31.2 +/- 12.1 at 24 months, n.s.) or RI (0.61 +/- 0.01
      at baseline and 0.59 +/- 0.02 at 24 months, n.s.). CONCLUSION: Effective blood
      pressure control over a long period of time reduces the severity of organ damage,
      namely UAE while maintaining renovascular resistance in patients with essential
      hypertension. Different classes of antihypertensive agents might convey
      additional specific renal protection beyond blood pressure control. These data
      could be useful in devising individualized therapeutic strategies in hypertensive
      patients at increased renal risk.

TI  - Treatment of heart failure in patients with diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 285-307
AB  - Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased morbidity and mortality from
      cardiovascular disease. Both coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure
      (CHF) are largely responsible for the increased cardiovascular adverse events in 
      patients with diabetes. This review discusses the pathophysiology of CHF, the
      mechanisms of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and the neurohormonal mechanisms 
      involved in both LV dysfunction and CHF. Diabetes with and without hypertension
      is an important cause of LV dysfunction and CHF. Diabetes may be responsible for 
      the metabolic and ultrastructural causes of LV dysfunction, while hypertension
      may be responsible for the marked fibrotic changes that are found. Experimental
      induction of diabetes in animals has shed light on the biochemical and
      ultrastructural changes seen. The role of insulin to reverse both metabolic and
      structural changes is reviewed both from experimental data and with the limited
      amount of clinical data available. The therapy of CHF in patients with diabetes
      is similar to that of patients without diabetes, with therapy directed toward the
      use of beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. As the
      morbidity and mortality are higher in patients with diabetes, several studies
      have pointed out the importance of this subgroup where the opportunity to make a 
      significant clinical impact exists. A significant opportunity exists to reduce
      morbidity and mortality with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors when ischaemia and 
      CHF are both present. However, studies in patients diabetes have been limited to 
      post hoc subgroup analyses and rarely as predefined subgroups. Clinical trials
      involving patients with diabetes with and without hypertension and LV dysfunction
      are clearly needed in the future to adequately address the needs of this high
      risk subgroup.

TI  - Autonomic tone as a cardiovascular risk factor: the dangers of chronic fight or
      flight.
PG  - 45-54
AB  - Chronic imbalance of the autonomic nervous system is a prevalent and potent risk 
      factor for adverse cardiovascular events, including mortality. Although not
      widely recognized by clinicians, this risk factor is easily assessed by measures 
      such as resting and peak exercise heart rate, heart rate recovery after exercise,
      and heart rate variability. Any factor that leads to inappropriate activation of 
      the sympathetic nervous system can be expected to have an adverse effect on these
      measures and thus on patient outcomes, while any factor that augments vagal tone 
      tends to improve outcomes. Insulin resistance, sympathomimetic medications, and
      negative psychosocial factors all have the potential to affect autonomic function
      adversely and thus cardiovascular prognosis. Congestive heart failure and
      hypertension also provide important lessons about the adverse effects of
      sympathetic predominance, as well as illustrate the benefits of beta-blockers and
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 2 classes of drugs that reduce
      adrenergic tone. Other interventions, such as exercise, improve cardiovascular
      outcomes partially by increasing vagal activity and attenuating sympathetic
      hyperactivity.

TI  - Sympathetic overactivity as a cause of hypertension in chronic renal failure.
PG  - 3-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature on sympathetic mediation of
      hypertension in chronic renal failure. BACKGROUND: Hypertension is present in the
      vast majority of patients with chronic renal failure and constitutes a major risk
      factor for the excessive cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this patient
      population. Although, traditionally, this hypertension is thought to be largely
      volume-dependent, an increasing body of literature suggests that there is an
      important sympathetic neural component. Microneurographic studies have
      demonstrated sympathetic overactivity without baroreflex impairment in both
      hypertensive chronic hemodialysis patients as well as in those with less advanced
      renal insufficiency. Sympathetic nerve activity was found to be normal in
      hemodialysis patients with bilateral nephrectomy, leading to the hypothesis that 
      sympathetic overactivity in uremia is caused by a neurogenic signal (carried by
      renal afferents) arising in the failing kidney. This hypothesis is supported by
      rat studies showing that renal deafferentation abrogates hypertension in the 5/6 
      nephrectomy model of chronic renal insufficiency. In addition, in patients with
      chronic renal insufficiency and renin-dependent hypertension, sympathetic
      overactivity was normalized by chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition
      but not by calcium channel blockade, implicating a major central neural action of
      angiotensin II. CONCLUSIONS: Sympathetic overactivity in chronic renal failure is
      caused by neurohormonal mechanisms arising in the failing kidney. Future clinical
      studies are needed to determine whether normalization of sympathetic activity
      should constitute an important therapeutic goal in this high-risk patient
      population.

TI  - Gender and age effects on the ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate responses 
      to antihypertensive therapy.
PG  - 1239-47
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess potential differences in the 24-h
      antihypertensive response to treatment with the controlled-onset,
      extended-release (COER) calcium antagonist, verapamil in men versus women and
      older versus younger patients with hypertension. METHODS: Meta-analyses were
      performed of three prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trials with COER-verapamil in patients with mid-stage I to stage III essential
      hypertension. The trials were conducted at medical clinics in the US and Canada
      in patients with a mean office diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 95 to 115 mm Hg
      on 2 consecutive weeks and a mean daytime diastolic BP >90 mm Hg. Patients were
      randomized to treatment with 180 to 540 mg/day of COER-verapamil (N = 273) or
      placebo (N = 125). Changes from baseline in ambulatory BP and heart rate after
      COER-verapamil were compared in men versus women and in older versus younger
      patients. RESULTS: Treatment with COER-verapamil caused significant reductions in
      24-h and early-morning systolic and diastolic BP in all of the subpopulations as 
      compared with placebo (P < .001). COER-verapamil induced a greater reduction in
      both 24-h systolic (-15.1 v -10.0 mm Hg; P < .001) and diastolic (-10.4 v -8.2 mm
      Hg; P = .003) BP in women compared with men. Older patients showed a greater mean
      reduction in 24-h diastolic BP (-10.2 v -8.2 mm Hg; P < .05) and heart rate (-5.7
      v -4.4 beats/min; P < .05) compared with younger patients. Side effects were
      similar in all of the COER-verapamil treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both gender
      and age were significant determinants of the response to COER-verapamil. The
      antihypertensive effect of verapamil is greater in women than in men and in older
      patients compared with younger patients.

TI  - A review of class III antiarrhythmic agents for atrial fibrillation: maintenance 
      of normal sinus rhythm.
PG  - 1514-29
AB  - A noteworthy shift from class I to class III antiarrhythmic agents for
      suppression of atrial fibrillation has occurred. Sotalol, amiodarone, and
      dofetilide have been evaluated for their ability to maintain sinus rhythm in
      patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. All of these agents are moderately
      effective; however, amiodarone appears to be most efficacious. Aside from their
      common class III actions, these agents have profoundly different pharmacologic,
      pharmacokinetic, safety, and drug interaction profiles that help guide drug
      selection. Amiodarone and dofetilide are safe in patients who have had a
      myocardial infarction and those with heart failure. The safety of commercially
      available d,l-sotalol in these patients is poorly understood. Torsades de pointes
      is the most serious adverse effect of sotalol and dofetilide, and risk increases 
      with renal dysfunction. Amiodarone has minimal proarrhythmic risk but has
      numerous noncardiac toxicities that require frequent monitoring. Overall, an
      ideal antiarrhythmic agent does not exist, and drug selection should be highly
      individualized.

TI  - Sustained improvement of renal graft function for two years in hypertensive renal
      transplant recipients treated with nifedipine as compared to lisinopril.
PG  - 1787-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of posttransplant hypertension is still a matter of debate.
      Calcium antagonists may ameliorate renal side effects of cyclosporin. Angiotensin
      converting enzyme- (ACE) inhibitors may be more effective in sustaining renal
      function in native chronic renal disease. We prospectively compared the effect of
      controlled release nifedipine and lisinopril on long-term renal function in
      hypertensive kidney transplant patients treated with cyclosporin. METHODS: A
      total of 154 renal transplant patients presenting with hypertension (diastolic
      blood pressure >or=95 mmHg) during the first 3 weeks after transplantation were
      randomised to receive double-blind nifedipine 30 mg or lisinopril 10 mg once
      daily. A total of 123 patients completed 1 year of treatment (69 nifedipine, 54
      lisinopril) and 64 patients completed 2 years of double-blind treatment (39
      nifedipine, 25 lisinopril). Baseline glomerular filtration rate was measured as
      99 mTc-diethylene-triaminepentaacetate clearance in a stable phase 2 to 5 weeks
      after inclusion and repeated at 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: Baseline glomerular
      filtration rates were similar (46+/-16 ml/min with nifedipine, 43+/-14 ml/min
      with lisinopril). The changes in glomerular filtration rates from baseline were
      statistically significant between the groups after 1 year (9.6 ml/min mean
      treatment difference (95% confidence interval [CI]s 5.5-13.7 ml/min, P=0.0001)
      and remained statistically significant also after 2 years (10.3 ml/min mean
      difference (95% CIs 4.0-16.6], P=0.0017). After 1 year glomerular filtration
      rates averaged 56+/-19 ml/min in the nifedipine group and 44+/-14 ml/min in the
      lisinopril group. CONCLUSIONS: Both nifedipine and lisinopril were safe and
      effective in treatment of hypertension in renal transplant patients treated with 
      cyclosporin. Patients receiving nifedipine but not lisinopril improved kidney
      transplant function over a period of 2 years.

TI  - Contrasting effects of verapamil and amlodipine on cardiovascular stress
      responses in hypertension.
PG  - 687-92
AB  - AIMS: To compare the effects of two long-acting calcium antagonists of different 
      types on cardiovascular stress responses in hypertension. METHODS: One-hundred
      and forty-five patients with mild to moderate hypertension and a mean (+/-
      s.e.mean) age of 51 +/- 0.9 years received for 8 weeks the phenylalkylamine
      verapamil sustained release (240 mg) and the dihydropyridine amlodipine (5 mg) in
      a double-blind cross-over design, both after 4 weeks of placebo. Blood pressure, 
      heart rate and plasma noradrenaline were monitored during 3 min of sustained
      isometric handgrip and 2 min of cold pressor. RESULTS: Blood pressure was equally
      reduced by both drugs. After 3 min handgrip, systolic blood pressure, heart rate 
      and rate-pressure product were lower with verapamil compared with amlodipine.
      Verapamil attenuated the increases in systolic blood pressure (25 +/- 2 vs 30 +/-
      2 mmHg, difference 4.6, 95% CI (1.0, 8.1), P < 0.01) and rate-pressure product
      (3.1 +/- 0.2 vs 3.6 +/- 0.3 x 10(3) mmHg x beats min(-1), difference 0.5, 95% CI 
      (0.1, 0.9), P < 0.01) during handgrip compared with amlodipine. Similar results
      were observed during cold pressor. Plasma noradrenaline levels were lower with
      verapamil compared with amlodipine at rest and after both tests, but the
      increases in plasma noradrenaline were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Verapamil is more effective in reducing blood pressure and rate-pressure product 
      responses to stress compared with amlodipine. Although plasma noradrenaline is
      lower with verapamil at rest and after stress, the increase during stress is not 
      different.

TI  - The effects of dihydropyridine and phenylalkylamine calcium antagonist classes on
      autonomic function in hypertension: the VAMPHYRE study.
PG  - 1083-9
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of a long-acting
      dihydropyridine (amlodipine) and a nondihydropyridine (verapamil) on autonomic
      function in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. A total of 145 patients 
      with a diastolic blood pressure (BP) between 95 and 110 mm Hg received 8 weeks of
      verapamil sustained release (240 mg) and amlodipine (5 mg) in a prospective
      randomized, double blind, cross-over study, both after 4 weeks of placebo. The
      24-h autonomic balance was measured by analysis of 24-h heart rate variability
      and short-term autonomic control of BP by baroreflex sensitivity measurements.
      Plasma norepinephrine was sampled at rest. Blood pressure was equally reduced
      from 153/100 mm Hg to 139/91 mm Hg with verapamil and 138/91 mm Hg with
      amlodipine, P = .50/.59. The low- to high-frequency ratio (LF/HF), reflecting
      sympathovagal balance, was higher with amlodipine than with verapamil (4.66 v
      4.10; P = .001). Baroreflex function was improved by both treatments; however,
      baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was significantly higher with verapamil than with
      amlodipine (8.47 v 8.06 msec/mm Hg; P = .01). Plasma norepinephrine (NE) level
      was higher with amlodipine than with verapamil (1.59 v 1.32 nmol/L; P < .0001).
      Amlodipine induces a shift in sympathovagal balance, as measured by heart rate
      variability indices and plasma NE, toward sympathetic predominance compared with 
      vagal predominance with verapamil. Short-term autonomic control of BP, as
      assessed by BRS, is more effectively improved by verapamil than by amlodipine.
      These contrasting effects on autonomic function suggest that the
      nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist verapamil may have additional beneficial
      effects beyond lowering BP compared with the dihydropyridine amlodipine.

TI  - Safety of controlled-onset extended-release verapamil in middle-aged and older
      patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease.
PG  - 1010-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to study the safety of controlled-onset,
      extended-release (COER) verapamil in patients with hypertension or coronary
      artery disease, with a focus on elderly patients. METHODS: Adverse event data
      were pooled from 7 double-blind, multicenter, randomized trials including 1999
      patients with hypertension or chronic stable angina pectoris. There were 1042
      patients who received COER verapamil 180 to 540 mg once daily in the evening for 
      up to 10 weeks, 373 patients who received placebo, and 584 who received an active
      comparator agent. Data were analyzed according to the following groups: all
      patients, patients with hypertension, patients with angina, older patients (>/=65
      years old), and younger patients (<65 years old). Adverse event rates were
      compared across the treatment groups by the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: In all
      patients combined, the incidence of constipation (13% vs 2%), dizziness (6% vs
      2%), and back pain (3% vs 1%) was higher in patients treated with COER verapamil 
      than with placebo. Patients with hypertension had more back pain (4% vs 1%) and
      constipation (12% vs 1%) with COER verapamil than with placebo, whereas patients 
      with angina had more bradycardia (2.6% vs 0%), dizziness (8% vs 2%), and
      constipation (15% vs 3%). Older patients treated with COER verapamil had more
      bradycardia, constipation, dizziness, and fatigue and had fewer headaches
      compared with younger patients treated with COER verapamil. Second- or
      third-degree atrioventricular block was not observed after administration of COER
      verapamil in any subgroup. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that COER verapamil
      has an acceptable safety profile that is largely unrelated to age in patients
      with hypertension or coronary artery disease.

TI  - Comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amlodipine in hypertensive
      patients with and without type II diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1215-24
AB  - Recent clinical trials aimed at attenuating complications in diabetes mellitus
      have generated interest in the impact of drug formulation and altered
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in diabetes. Specifically, it has been
      proposed that the diabetic state may alter the pharmacokinetics of several
      cardiovascular drugs, including some calcium antagonists. The present study
      investigates the effects of diabetes mellitus on the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of amlodipine in hypertensive subjects with and without diabetes
      mellitus to determine whether the diabetic state alters these parameters. This
      trial consisted of a 2-week placebo washout phase, a 2-week titration phase, and 
      a 2-week maintenance phase. Study patients included 18 hypertensive patients with
      type II diabetes mellitus and 10 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. Blood samples
      were collected after administration of amlodipine and AUC, Cmax, and tmax were
      determined. The acute 24-hour pharmacodynamic response to amlodipine was assessed
      by blood pressure and telemetric heart rate measurements. There were no
      significant differences for either amlodipine 5 or 10 mg in AUC (p = 0.40 for 5
      mg; p = 0.59 for 10 mg), Cmax (p = 0.41 for 5 mg; p = 0.45 for 10 mg), and tmax
      (p = 0.79 for 5 mg; p = 0.67 for 10 mg) between diabetic and nondiabetic
      hypertensive subjects. Similarly, the 24-hour pharmacodynamic effects of
      amlodipine on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate
      did not differ between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects as assessed by
      repeated-measures analysis of variance. Because of the theoretical basis for
      anticipating that diabetes mellitus may provoke important pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic alterations, our study provides an important database in clearly 
      demonstrating that the diabetic milieu did not alter the pharmacokinetics or
      pharmacodynamics of amlodipine.

TI  - Treating hypertension in the elderly.
PG  - 355-65
AB  - Hypertension is highly prevalent in elderly individuals, the most rapidly growing
      segment of the US population. Epidemiologic studies have established that
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease is associated with elevated blood
      pressure. Treatment of hypertension in elderly patients significantly reduces
      their cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, antihypertensive therapy
      is often challenging in this patient population because of potential metabolic
      and physiologic alterations, multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, and biologic
      variability. Drugs with a convenient dosing schedule, minimal side effects, and
      the ability to impact comorbid conditions are important considerations in the
      treatment of hypertension in the elderly.

TI  - [Effects of long-acting calcium antagonists--amlodipine and diltiazem in patients
      with stable angina of effort: comparative randomized controlled trial].
PG  - 42-6
AB  - AIM: To compare effectiveness of two long-acting calcium antagonists--amlodipin
      and diltiazem--in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stable angina of
      effort (SAE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 31 IHD patients with SAE entered the double
      blind randomized trial. The patients received either amlodipin (5-10 mg once a
      day) or diltiazem (120-180 mg twice a day) for 4 weeks. Selection of the
      effective single dose and control over the drug effectiveness in regular intake
      was carried out using treadmill tests made at the height of the drug activity
      (peak effect) and before taking the next dose (end effect). RESULTS: 1 patient
      quitted the trial because of frequent anginal attacks while amlodipin
      administration. Both drugs showed positive effect in relation to exercise
      tolerance, peak effect of diltiazem was significantly higher than that of
      amlodipin, the end effect was the same. Amlodipin increased the heart rate at
      rest while diltiazem insignificantly decreased it. Amlodipin induced side effects
      more often, all of them were typical for dihydropiridin calcium antagonists.
      CONCLUSION: Amlodipin and diltiazem of prolonged action have pronounced
      antianginal effect, diltiazem being more effective and less toxic.

TI  - Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction unmasked by nifedipine: a therapeutic 
      pitfall in the management of chronic aortic regurgitation.
PG  - 691-3
AB  - This case report illustrates the aggravation of a clinically silent left
      ventricular outflow tract obstruction by maintenance use of nifedipine in a
      patient with chronic severe aortic regurgitation, and demonstrates a potential
      limitation of vasodilator therapy in the management of this patient population.
      Recognition of this clinical scenario is imperative, as decision making in
      patients with chronic severe aortic regurgitation rests on the development of
      symptoms and/or left ventricular dysfunction in relation to the regurgitant
      volume. The importance of echocardiography in the detection of this valvular
      finding and in the follow up of these patients is emphasized.

TI  - Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment 
      (HOT) study.
PG  - 1755-63
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study showed that
      when antihypertensive treatment reduces diastolic blood pressure well below 90
      mmHg, there can be a further reduction of cardiovascular events, particularly
      myocardial infarction, with no evidence of a J-shaped curve at lower pressures.
      Office measurement, however, gives no information about blood pressure outside
      the office. This paper describes a HOT substudy in which patients underwent both 
      office measurement and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. METHODS: The
      mean age of the substudy population was 62 +/- 7 years. Substudy patients were
      treated for a median period of 2 years. All received the dihydropyridine calcium 
      antagonist felodipine, while some also received an ACE-inhibitor, a beta-blocker 
      or a diuretic. Average 24 h, day and night ambulatory blood pressure values were 
      computed at baseline (n = 277) and during treatment (n = 347): 112 patients had
      been randomized to a target office diastolic blood pressure <or= 90 mmHg, 117 to 
      <or= 85 mmHg and 118 to <or= 80 mmHg. Additional analyses included computation
      of: (1) trough-to-peak ratio and (2) the smoothness index (the ratio between the 
      average of the 24 hourly blood pressure reductions after treatment and its
      standard deviation). RESULTS: Taking the subgroup as a whole, baseline 24 h
      average blood pressures (146 +/- 18/90 +/- 10 mmHg) were significantly and
      markedly lower than office blood pressures (170 +/- 14/105 +/- 3 mmHg, P < 0.01).
      Office, 24 h, day and night blood pressures were all significantly reduced by
      treatment, but there was a smaller fall in ambulatory, than in office pressures. 
      The between group differences in office blood pressure were smaller than those
      observed in the overall HOT sample. Between-group differences in 24 h blood
      pressure were even smaller. Trough-to-peak ratios and smoothness indices were
      lowest in the highest blood pressure target group and highest in the lowest blood
      pressure target group. Office and ambulatory blood pressures were similar in the 
      groups randomized to placebo (n = 170) or acetylsalicylic acid (n = 177).
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in the HOT study, treatment reduced not only office
      but also ambulatory blood pressure throughout the 24 h. The reduction was less
      marked for ambulatory than for office blood pressure.

TI  - T cell involvement in cutaneous drug eruptions.
PG  - 1398-408
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most frequent side-effects of drug therapy are skin eruptions.
      Their pathomechanism is rather unclear. OBJECTIVE: In this prospective study we
      investigated the T cell activation and drug specificity in different forms of
      drug-induced exanthemas from 22 patients. METHODS: During acute drug allergy,
      liver parameters and T cell subset activation in the circulation (up-regulation
      of CD25 and HLA-DR) were evaluated and skin biopsies of the acute lesion
      performed. After recovery, the causative drug was identified by lymphocyte
      transformation (LTT) and scratch-patch tests. RESULTS: Seventeen of 22 (17/22)
      patients had maculo-papular exanthema, 4/22 bullous exanthema and 1/22 urticaria.
      The causative drugs were mainly antibiotics, anti-epileptics and
      anti-hypertensives. Up-regulation of HLA-DR on circulating CD4(+) and/or CD8(+) T
      cells was detected in 17 patients, being most marked in patients with bullous
      reactions or hepatic involvement. The LTT was positive in 14/21 analysed and the 
      patch test in 7/15. All patients showed lymphocytic infiltration in the skin
      biopsy of the acute lesion. Generally CD4(+) T cells dominated; a higher
      percentage of circulating CD8(+) T cells was found in patients with bullous skin 
      reactions or hepatic involvement. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate activation and
      drug specificity of T cells in drug-induced skin eruptions. A predominant CD8(+) 
      T cell activation leads to more severe (bullous) skin symptoms or liver
      involvement, while predominant activation of CD4(+) cells elicits mainly
      maculo-papular reactions.

TI  - Use of risk stratification to identify patients with unstable angina likeliest to
      benefit from an invasive versus conservative management strategy.
PG  - 969-76
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to determine whether patient characteristics 
      collected at presentation can identify which patients benefit from immediate
      coronary angiography and revascularization. BACKGROUND: Risk stratification may
      offer a method for identifying which patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave 
      myocardial infarction (NQMI) are likeliest to benefit from invasive management
      strategies. METHODS: The analysis was based on data from a randomized controlled 
      trial that enrolled 1,473 patients presenting with unstable angina or NQMI who
      were randomly assigned to an early invasive or early conservative (medical)
      management strategy. We constructed a risk-stratification score for each patient 
      based on adjusted odds ratios for clinical variables likely to predict adverse
      outcomes. We stratified all trial subjects by their risk scores and studied the
      rates of death or myocardial infarction (MI) of the early invasive management
      strategy in each stratum. RESULTS: The final multivariate model included older
      age, ST segment depression on presentation, history of complicated angina before 
      presentation, and elevation in baseline creatine kinase-MB fraction. Although
      patients with a higher risk score had an increased rate of death or MI within 42 
      days and 365 days (p < 0.001) in both management strategies, early invasive
      management for patients in the high and very high risk categories was associated 
      with a lower rate of death or MI within 42 days compared with conservative
      management. No such benefit was seen in patients in the larger group of patients 
      in the very low, low or moderate risk categories (p = 0.03 for the interaction
      between risk category and management assignment). CONCLUSIONS: Risk
      stratification may be an effective method for identifying those patients with
      unstable angina or NQMI most likely to benefit from early invasive management.
      Selective use of early invasive management can have a substantial impact in
      reducing morbidity and mortality in higher risk patients, but may not be
      warranted in lower risk patients.

TI  - Effective blood pressure treatment improves LDL-cholesterol susceptibility to
      oxidation in patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 322-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: LDL-cholesterol particles from hypertensive patients exhibit enhanced
      susceptibility to in vitro oxidation, an abnormality thought to increase
      cardiovascular risk. We tested whether blood pressure (BP) normalization can
      reverse this abnormality. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized pharmacological
      intervention trial. SETTING: Clinical research centre. Subjects. A total of 29
      nondiabetic, normolipidaemic patients with essential hypertension (BP= 151 +/-
      3/99 +/- 1 mmHg) and 11 normotensive controls (BP=125 +/- 3/85 +/- 1 mmHg)
      matched for gender, age, obesity, glucose tolerance and lipid profile.
      Intervention. Anti-hypertensive treatment for 3 months with a calcium-antagonist 
      in randomized combination with either an ACE inhibitor or a beta-blocker. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Lag phase of copper-induced LDL oxidation, cell-mediated (human
      umbilical vein endothelium) generation of malondialdehyde (MDA) by LDL and
      vitamin E content in LDL. RESULTS: At baseline in hypertensives versus controls, 
      lag phase was shorter (89 +/- 3 vs. 107 +/- 6 min, P < 0.04), MDA generation was 
      higher (5.8 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.2 nmol L(-1), P=0.002), and vitamin E was
      reduced (6.40 +/- 0.05 vs. 6.67 +/- 0.11 microg mg(-1), P=0.03). At 3 months, BP 
      was normalized (124 +/- 3/81 +/- 1, P < 0.0001 vs. baseline, P=ns versus
      controls), lag phase was prolonged (to 98 +/- 3 min, P=0.0005), MDA generation
      was reduced (5.6 +/- 0.1 nmol L-1, P = 0.001), and vitamin E was increased (6.53 
      +/- 0.05 microg mg(-1), P=0.003), with no significant differences between the
      randomized groups. CONCLUSIONS: In nondiabetic, nonobese, normolipidaemic
      patients with essential hypertension, LDL susceptibility to copper- and
      cell-mediated oxidation is increased. BP normalization is associated with a
      significant improvement, but not a full reversal, of this abnormality.

TI  - A comparison of selected antihypertensives and the use of conventional vs
      ambulatory blood pressure in the detection and treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 3-9
AB  - This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was undertaken
      to determine the effectiveness of selected antihypertensives (doxazosin,
      amlodipine, enalapril, and bendrofluazide) in maintaining 24-hour control of
      blood pressure (BP). The predictive value of ambulatory (A)BP versus clinic (C)BP
      measurements as a method for detecting patients with hypertension was also
      evaluated. A total of 204 patients were screened and of these 110 were diagnosed 
      as mild to moderately hypertensive with clinic diastolic BP 100-110 mm Hg (> or
      =95 mm Hg in patients with coronary heart disease risk factors). The 4
      antihypertensives were all equally effective at controlling BP over 24 h, as
      shown by 24-hour ABP measurements. The incidence of adverse events was similar
      for all 4 treatment groups; headache was the most common event, being reported by
      22 patients (20%). There was a clinically relevant reduction in total cholesterol
      for the doxazosin (-15.4 mg/dl) and amlodipine (-11.6 mg/dl) treatment groups in 
      comparison with enalapril and bendrofluazide. Our results from ABP measurements
      suggest that the antihypertensives studied are effective first-line therapy in
      the regulation of hypertension and that ABP is a reproducible measure. ABP may
      also be useful in identifying patients with various types of high BP, for
      instance those with 'white coat' hypertension, enabling more accurate screening
      and diagnosis.

TI  - Management of hypertension by general practitioners: an Italian observational
      study.
PG  - 122-30
AB  - Data on patients receiving antihypertensive therapy were collected from 20
      general practitioners (GPs) in Campania, Italy, to determine the prescription of 
      different antihypertensive classes and their use with other drugs for concomitant
      diseases, to investigate the main factors influencing antihypertensive choice, to
      document treatment outcome, and to assess adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Each GP 
      completed a data card for each consultation that produced an antihypertensive
      prescription; 1900 cards were collected. The most frequently used
      antihypertensives were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (49.6%), calcium 
      antagonists (24.8%), beta blockers (11.7%), angiotensin II-receptor blockers
      (5.5%), and alpha blockers (0.9%). In 82% of patients, blood pressure was reduced
      but did not reach normotensive levels. The choice of antihypertensive treatment
      was influenced by international guidelines (56%), clinical diagnosis (25%),
      concomitant diseases (8%), cost (4%), compliance (3%), and other factors (5%).
      ADRs--most often cough (35.7%), edema (22.7%), headache (13.3%), and tachycardia 
      (7.8%)--occurred in 11.8% of patients.

TI  - Effects of losartan on renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 
      diabetes and nephropathy.
PG  - 861-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease.
      Interruption of the renin-angiotensin system slows the progression of renal
      disease in patients with type 1 diabetes, but similar data are not available for 
      patients with type 2, the most common form of diabetes. We assessed the role of
      the angiotensin-II-receptor antagonist losartan in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      and nephropathy. METHODS: A total of 1513 patients were enrolled in this
      randomized, double-blind study comparing losartan (50 to 100 mg once daily) with 
      placebo, both taken in addition to conventional antihypertensive treatment
      (calcium-channel antagonists, diuretics, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, and
      centrally acting agents), for a mean of 3.4 years. The primary outcome was the
      composite of a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration,
      end-stage renal disease, or death. Secondary end points included a composite of
      morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes, proteinuria, and the rate of 
      progression of renal disease. RESULTS: A total of 327 patients in the losartan
      group reached the primary end point, as compared with 359 in the placebo group
      (risk reduction, 16 percent; P=0.02). Losartan reduced the incidence of a
      doubling of the serum creatinine concentration (risk reduction, 25 percent;
      P=0.006) and end-stage renal disease (risk reduction, 28 percent; P=0.002) but
      had no effect on the rate of death. The benefit exceeded that attributable to
      changes in blood pressure. The composite of morbidity and mortality from
      cardiovascular causes was similar in the two groups, although the rate of first
      hospitalization for heart failure was significantly lower with losartan (risk
      reduction, 32 percent; P=0.005). The level of proteinuria declined by 35 percent 
      with losartan (P<0.001 for the comparison with placebo). CONCLUSIONS: Losartan
      conferred significant renal benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes and
      nephropathy, and it was generally well tolerated.

TI  - Perioperative cardiac complications.
PG  - 1151-69, vi
AB  - Although infrequent, perioperative cardiac complications are a source of major
      morbidity and mortality. As the population ages, the prevalence of cardiovascular
      disease is increasing. For physicians who refer patients for surgery as well as
      for clinicians directly involved in perioperative medical care, an understanding 
      of perioperative cardiac complications, reduction of such complications, and
      treatment of complications is essential. This article summarizes the approach to 
      perioperative hypertension, hypotension, myocardial ischemia, myocardial
      infarction, and congestive heart failure.

TI  - A prevention strategy for circumventing drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy.
PG  - 1595-614
AB  - The development of drug resistance is considered to be a major cause for the
      failure of chemotherapy in a number of types of cancer, including ovarian, breast
      and lung. Most previous research has focused on approaches to reverse drug
      resistance once it has arisen, that is, on the use of agents which can make
      drug-resistant tumors more sensitive to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, this
      approach has thus far met with only limited clinical success. Because of the
      prevalence of drug resistance in cases of advanced cancer, there exists an urgent
      need to develop new approaches to dealing with this problem. We have hypothesized
      the feasibility of an alternative approach: the use of specific agents to prevent
      the development of resistance before it arises. Our initial studies to examine
      this hypothesis have focused on ovarian cancer. We have designed both in vitro
      and in vivo systems in which resistance develops rapidly after exposure of tumor 
      cells or xenografts to melphalan or cisplatin. Using these systems we have shown 
      that two selenium compounds, selenite and selenomethionine are able to prevent
      the induction of resistance. Furthermore, inclusion of selenite in a
      chemotherapeutic protocol can result in a significant enhancement of the efficacy
      of cisplatin in suppressing the growth of human ovarian tumor xenografts. These
      results have supported the idea that prevention may be a useful new approach to
      the problem of drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy.

TI  - Effects of once-daily angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and calcium
      channel blockade-based antihypertensive treatment regimens on left ventricular
      hypertrophy and diastolic filling in hypertension: the prospective randomized
      enalapril study evaluating regression of ventricular enlargement (preserve)
      trial.
PG  - 1248-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Prospective Randomized Enalapril Study Evaluating Regression of
      Ventricular Enlargement (PRESERVE) study was designed to test whether enalapril
      achieves greater left ventricular (LV) mass reduction than does a nifedipine
      gastrointestinal treatment system by a prognostically meaningful degree on a
      population basis (10 g/m(2)). METHODS AND RESULTS: An ethnically diverse
      population of 303 men and women with essential hypertension and increased LV mass
      at screening echocardiography were enrolled at clinical centers on 4 continents
      and studied by echocardiography at baseline and after 6- and 12-month randomized 
      therapy. Clinical examination and blinded echocardiogram readings 48 weeks after 
      study entry in an intention-to-treat analysis of 113 enalapril-treated and 122
      nifedipine-treated patients revealed similar reductions in systolic/diastolic
      pressure (-22/12 versus -21/13 mm Hg) and LV mass index (-15 versus -17g/m(2),
      both P>0.20). No significant between-treatment difference was detected in
      population subsets defined by monotherapy treatment, sex, age, race, or severity 
      of baseline hypertrophy. Similarly, there was no between-treatment difference in 
      change in velocities of early diastolic or atrial phase transmitral blood flow.
      More enalapril-treated than nifedipine-treated patients required supplemental
      treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (59% versus 34%, P<0.001) but not atenolol
      (27% versus 22%, NS). CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily antihypertensive treatment with
      enalapril or long-acting nifedipine, plus adjunctive hydrochlorothiazide and
      atenolol when needed to control blood pressure, both had moderately beneficial
      and statistically indistinguishable effects on regression of LV hypertrophy.

TI  - Effects of long-acting ACE inhibitor (temocapril) and long-acting Ca channel
      blocker (amlodipine) on 24-h ambulatory BP in elderly hypertensive patients.
PG  - 643-8
AB  - In a prospective randomised cross-over study, we compared the effects of ACE
      inhibitor temocapril and calcium channel blocker (CCB) amlodipine on ambulatory
      blood pressure in 59 asymptomatic elderly hypertensive patients (mean age 69
      years). This study was performed in a cross-over fashion after a 2-week placebo
      period and 4 to 8 weeks each of treatment with temocapril and amlodipine. Of
      those 59 hypertensive patients, three patients with side effects and 10 patients 
      whose office BPs did not achieve the target BPs were excluded, and the remaining 
      46 were analysed in this study: they consisted of 30 dippers, with a night time
      reduction in systolic BP (SBP) > or = 10% and 16 non-dippers, with reduction by <
      10%. At the baseline, there were no significant differences in the office, 24-h
      or daytime BPs between the two groups (dippers and non-dippers). Though the
      office BPs and daytime BPs were successfully controlled to the same levels with
      both treatments and in both dipping groups, the antihypertensive effects were
      stronger with the CCB than with the ACE inhibitor in the night time and morning, 
      especially in non-dippers. We conclude that even though office BPs were
      controlled successfully to almost the same levels, there is a possibility that
      these long-acting drugs have differential antihypertensive effects on night time 
      and morning BPs among hypertensive patients with different night time BP dipping 
      statuses.

TI  - [The comparison of hypotensive efficiency and tolerability of amlodipine and
      enalapril in patients with essential hypertension].
PG  - 109-15
AB  - In this multicentre, double-blind trial in 176 patients with mild or moderate
      essential hypertension were randomized to amlodipine or enalapril monotherapy
      after 2-week period of placebo. Doses of amlodipine (2.5-10 mg once daily) and
      enalapril (5-20 mg once daily) were titrated to achieve office blood pressure
      below 140/90 mm Hg during 8 weeks of therapy. Both drugs were similarly effective
      in lowering blood pressure and goal blood pressure was achieved in 72.4% patients
      treated with amlodipine and 67.4% with enalapril. Also, degree of reduction of
      blood pressure was similar in both groups. Compared to initial values:
      systolic/diastolic blood pressure decreased by 23.5/14.9 mm Hg in amlodipine
      group and 23.2/14.0 mm Hg in subjects receiving enalapril. However, adverse
      effects, especially dry cough were more frequent in enalapril-treated patients.
      Both amlodipine and enalapril provide significant blood pressure reduction in
      stage I-II hypertension. Tolerance of short-term therapy was good in both groups 
      however number of adverse events was significantly lower in amlodipine-treated
      patients.

TI  - Antihypertensive drug prescription trends at the primary health care centres in
      Bahrain.
PG  - 219-27
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the antihypertensive drug prescribing pattern by primary
      care physicians in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension; to
      identify whether such pattern of prescription is appropriate and in accordance
      with international guidelines for pharmacotherapy of hypertension; and to
      estimate the impact of such prescriptions on cost of treatment. METHODS: A
      prescription-based survey among patients with uncomplicated essential
      hypertension was conducted in seven out of a total of 18 health centres in
      Bahrain. The relevant data for our study was collected using cards, designed for 
      chronically-ill patients. RESULTS: A total of 1019 male and 1395 female (62.9%)
      out of 3838 of the study population were on monotherapy, whereas 596 male and 828
      female (37.1%) were on antihypertensive combination therapy. Among the
      monotherapy category, the various antihypertensive drugs used were as follows:
      beta-blockers (58.8%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (14.2%),
      calcium channel blockers (11.1%), diuretics (8.1%) and alpha-methyldopa (7.0%).
      With respect to overall utilization pattern, beta-blockers were the most
      frequently prescribed (65.5%), diuretics ranked second (27.4%), followed by ACE
      inhibitors (20.6%), calcium channel blockers (19.9%) and alpha-methyldopa (8.5%).
      Within each class of antihypertensives used, the most frequently used individual 
      agents were as follows: (a) among beta-blockers 97.7% used atenolol; (b) among
      the diuretics, indapamide (35.4%), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (32.7%), HCTZ in
      combination with triamterene (25.7%), and chlorthalidone (4.6%); (c) among the
      ACE inhibitors, captopril (44.9%), enalapril (29.7%), and lisinopril (19.0%); (d)
      among the calcium channel blockers, nifedipine (98.2%). Significant age- and
      gender-related differences in prescribing patterns were seen. Short-acting
      nifedipine monotherapy was inappropriately prescribed in a significant number of 
      patients above the age of 50 years. ACE inhibitors accounted for approximately
      two-thirds of the total antihypertensive drug expenditure, although these drugs
      represent only one-fifth of overall antihypertensives used. There is a trend
      towards excessive use of expensive thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide
      which seems to be unjustifiable practice, particularly in a study population free
      from diabetic hypertensive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The general pattern of
      antihypertensive utilization appears to be in accordance with the guidelines of
      WHO and the Joint National Committee issued in the 1990s. The trends of
      prescribing of antihypertensives were in favour of conventional ones such as the 
      beta blockers and diuretics, and the introduction of newer classes of
      antihypertensives had a generally minimal impact on the prescribing profile.
      Almost two-thirds of the patients were treated with monotherapy. A
      disproportionately large percentage of antihypertensive drug cost was due to
      overt use of ACE inhibitors, and indapamide, instead of thiazide diuretics. The
      use of short-acting calcium channel blockers especially in the elderly is
      unjustifiable.

TI  - Connective tissue growth factor in drug-induced gingival overgrowth.
PG  - 921-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-induced gingival overgrowth is a known side effect of certain
      chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of systemic disorders. The
      pathogenesis and mechanisms responsible for this condition are not fully
      understood. This study assesses for the presence and localization of connective
      tissue growth factor (CTGF) in drug-induced gingival overgrowth tissues. CTGF
      immunostaining was compared with sections stained with transforming growth factor
      (TGF)-beta1 and CD31 antibodies in order to investigate possible pathogenic
      mechanisms. METHODS: Gingival overgrowth samples were obtained from patients
      undergoing therapy with phenytoin (n = 9), nifedipine (n = 4), cyclosporin A (n =
      5), and control tissues from systemically healthy donors (n = 9). Tissue sections
      were subjected to peroxidase immunohistochemistry and were stained with CTGF and 
      TGF-beta1 polyclonal primary antibodies. Possible relationships between CTGF
      staining and angiogenesis were also studied using an anti-CD31 antibody as a
      marker for endothelial cells. Staining was analyzed by computer-assisted
      quantitative and semiquantitative methodology at 5 defined sites in all samples
      based on the location of specific landmarks including epithelium and underlying
      connective tissues. RESULTS: Cellular and extracellular CTGF content in phenytoin
      gingival overgrowth tissues was significantly (P<0.05) higher compared to the
      other gingival overgrowth tissues and the controls. Higher CTGF staining in
      phenytoin gingival overgrowth tissues was accompanied by an increased abundance
      of fibroblasts and connective tissue fibers. No strong association of CTGF
      staining with TGF-beta1 or CD31 staining was found. CONCLUSIONS: The data from
      the present study show significantly higher CTGF staining in phenytoin-induced
      gingival overgrowth tissues compared to controls, cyclosporin A-, or
      nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth. Moreover, semiquantitative analyses of
      histologic samples support the concept that the phenytoin overgrowth tissues are 
      fibrotic. These associations suggest a possible role for CTGF in promoting
      development of fibrotic lesions in phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of a therapeutic interchange from high-dose calcium channel
      blockers to a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril in patients with
      moderate-to-severe hypertension.
PG  - 559-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent hypertension trials have demonstrated the importance of
      achieving goal blood pressures to reduce the risk of target organ damage. In
      patients with moderate to severe hypertension, the use of high-dose monotherapy
      and/or combinations of drugs are necessary to achieve these goals. Fixed-dose
      combination products may be useful in these patients by reducing the number of
      daily doses required to control blood pressure. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the
      present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a therapeutic
      interchange between high-dose calcium channel blocker therapy and a fixed-dose
      combination of amlodipine/ benazepril (Lotrel; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, USA) in 
      patients with moderate to severe hypertension. METHODS: A total of 75 patients
      were switched from amlodipine (n = 25), felodipine (n = 25), and nifedipine-GITS 
      (n = 25) to amlodipine/benazepril. Twenty-eight of the 75 patients (37%) were
      taking either a beta-blocker or a diuretic in addition to the high-dose calcium
      channel blocker prior to the switch. Blood pressure control, side effects and the
      cost of the therapeutic interchange were evaluated in the year following the
      therapeutic interchange. RESULTS: Sixty-six of the 75 (88%) patients were
      successfully switched with maintenance of blood pressure control and without the 
      development of new dose-limiting side effects. Reasons for treatment failure
      after the therapeutic interchange included loss of blood pressure control in five
      patients and the development of new dose-limiting side effects in four patients. 
      These side effects included cough in three patients and rash in one patient.
      After accounting for differences in drug acquisition cost and costs related to
      the switch (clinic and emergency room and laboratory tests), a cost savings of
      $16030 for all 75 patients was realised in the first year. The per patient-per
      year cost savings was $214. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that a therapeutic
      interchange from selected high-dose calcium channel blockers to a fixed-dose
      combination of amlodipine/ benazepril can be successfully accomplished in the
      majority of patients.

TI  - A single (investigator)-blind randomised control trial comparing the effects of
      quinapril and nifedipine on platelet function in patients with mild to moderate
      hypertension.
PG  - 274-8
AB  - The effect of quinapril and nifedipine on platelet aggregation, vascular
      endothelial function and coagulation system activity, was compared in a
      parallel-group, investigator-blind study carried out on patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension but no other diseases or receiving medication which might
      affect platelet function, vascular endothelium or coagulation. Forty patients
      (two groups of 20 patients each) and 20 control subjects were recruited. Patients
      were randomised to receive either quinapril or nifedipine retard and the dose
      escalated to control hypertension. Platelet aggregation studies were assessed
      serially and beta-thromboglobulin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), von
      Willebrand factor (vWF) coagulation factors VIIIc, XII and fibrinogen were
      measured at the beginning and end of the 12-week period. Blood pressure was
      adequately controlled in all patients in both groups. Platelet function was
      impaired in certain parameters (slope of the reaction with ADP and collagen and
      maximum aggregation with collagen) in the patient group compared to controls
      before treatment and this improved in patients on quinapril but not on
      nifedipine; likewise beta-thromboglobulin was higher in the patient group and
      fell significantly in the quinapril group but not those on nifedipine.
      Measurements of endothelial function and coagulation were normal before treatment
      and showed no alteration during the study, except in the expected fall in plasma 
      ACE in the quinapril group. The results indicate that the ACE inhibitor,
      quinapril, has a beneficial effect on platelet function unlike the calcium
      channel blocker, nifedipine.

      in patients with stable angina.
PG  - 356-64
AB  - A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study comparing the efficacy and
      tolerability of once-daily diltiazem capsules with amlodipine tablets in patients
      with stable angina. After a run-in period of 1 to 3 weeks, 34 patients received
      once-daily diltiazem and 33 patients received amlodipine. Patients received
      either diltiazem, 240 mg/day, or amlodipine, 5 mg/day, for 2 weeks followed by
      diltiazem, 360 mg/day, or amlodipine, 10 mg/day, for 2 weeks. Standard treadmill 
      exercise testing was the primary efficacy assessment. Patients also recorded
      incidence of angina attacks and use of glyceryl trinitrate spray. Both treatments
      gave significant improvement in time to onset of angina and time to maximal
      exercise. With the exception of amlodipine, 5 mg/day, both treatments gave
      significant increases in time to 1-mm ST segment depression. Diltiazem, 360
      mg/day, gave a significant decrease in rate pressure product. There were no
      significant treatment differences in any of the exercise test parameters. Both
      treatments reduced incidence of angina attacks and use of glyceryl trinitrate
      spray. The incidence of edema was significantly less in patients receiving
      diltiazem. In conclusion, both treatments were effective in controlling patients'
      angina, but diltiazem was better tolerated, with a lower incidence of edema.

TI  - Less adrenergic response to mental task during verapamil compared to amlodipine
      treatment in hypertensive subjects.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - We compared the effects of amlodipine and verapamil slow release on autonomic
      responses to a 5-min mental arithmetic test (MST) in patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension. Twenty subjects received 8 weeks of verapamil slow release
      240 mg or amlodipine 10 mg in a double-blind crossover design, both after 4
      weeks' placebo. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were continuously
      monitored. Venous plasma catecholamines were analysed by a radioenzymatic assay. 
      Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was estimated with the transfer function technique. 
      Calculations of the area under the curve (AUC) were used to estimate average HR, 
      BP and catecholamine concentrations. The reactivity to MST was estimated as
      percent change from the basal AUC. A paired t-test was performed. Data are means 
      +/-SEM. Compared to verapamil, amlodipine increased average noradrenaline (NA)
      concentrations (245 +/- 23 vs 191 +/- 17 pg/l, respectively, p = 0.005), NA
      reactivity (14.0 +/- 5.5% vs -2.9 +/- 3.3, p = 0.004), average HR (65 +/- 2 vs 61
      +/- 2 beats/min, p < 0.001) and HR reactivity (2.5 +/- 1.0 vs 0.1 +/- 0.9%, p =
      0.056). BP did not differ significantly. BRS correlated with average and baseline
      HR on both medications (r = -0.53 and -0.63, p < or = 0.03). We conclude that
      adrenergic responses to MST are blunted on treatment with verapamil compared to
      amlodipine in hypertensive patients.

TI  - Intravenous magnesium sulfate versus diltiazem in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 287-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drugs currently available for the acute treatment of paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation have significant limitations. We assessed the safety and
      effectiveness of intravenous magnesium sulfate versus diltiazem therapy in
      patients with prolonged episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. METHODS: In a
      prospective randomized trial, 46 symptomatic patients presenting with paroxysmal 
      atrial fibrillation were given intravenous magnesium sulfate (n=23) or diltiazem 
      (n=23) therapy. Primary outcome measures were effects on ventricular rate control
      and proportion of patients restored to sinus rhythm at 6 h after initiation of
      treatment. RESULTS: There were no differences in baseline characteristics between
      the two groups. Both forms of treatment were well tolerated, with no adverse
      clinical events. Both drugs had similar efficacy in reducing the ventricular rate
      at the first hour of treatment (P<0.05) with a tendency toward a further decrease
      during infusion times of 2 (P<0.01), 3, 4, 5 and 6 h, respectively (P<0.001).
      However, at the end of the 6-h treatment period, restoration of sinus rhythm was 
      observed in a significantly higher proportion of patients in the magnesium group 
      compared with the diltiazem group [13 of 23 patients, (57%), versus five of 23
      patients, (22%), P=0.03]. CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium sulfate favorably affects rate
      control and seems to promote the conversion of long lasting episodes of
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm, representing a safe, reliable and
      cost-effective alternative treatment strategy to diltiazem.

TI  - Current concepts in the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 102-12
AB  - In spite of the effective drug therapy available for hypertensive patients in
      general, economic and social considerations continue to influence the low rate of
      detection, treatment and control of hypertension in the population of the
      developing world. The Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and
      Treatment of High Blood Pressure stated that in 1993 age-adjusted stroke rates
      rose slightly and that the age-adjusted rate of decline for coronary heart
      disease appeared to be levelling. Furthermore, rates for the incidence of
      end-stage renal disease increased, with hypertension the second most common
      cause. The Report also stated that hypertension control rates did not improve
      (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES III, Phase 1) from 1991
      to 1994, and there were only 27% on control. These disturbing trends support the 
      need to enhance public and professional education and to translate the results of
      research into improved health.

PG  - 158-64
AB  - Hypertensive crisis affects upward of 500,000 Americans each year. Although the
      incidence of hypertensive crisis is low, affecting fewer than 1% of hypertensive 
      adults, more than 50 million adult Americans suffer from hypertension.
      Presentation of a patient with severe hypertension to the emergency room demands 
      immediate evaluation, prompt recognition of a hypertensive emergency or urgency, 
      and the prompt institution of appropriate therapeutic measures to prevent
      progression of target-organ damage and to avoid a catastrophic event.
      Hypertensive emergencies are severe elevations in blood pressure that are
      complicated by evidence of progressive target-organ dysfunction such as coronary 
      ischemia, disordered cerebral function, a cerebrovascular event, pulmonary edema,
      or renal failure. Although therapy with parenteral antihypertensive agents may be
      initiated in the emergency department, these patients warrant prompt admission to
      an intensive care unit where continuous monitoring of blood pressure can be
      assured during therapy.

TI  - Female sexual dysfunction.
PG  - 405-16
AB  - The ideal approach to female sexual dysfunction would be a collaborative effort
      between therapists and physicians and would include a complete medical and
      psychosocial evaluation, and inclusion of the partner spouse in the evaluation
      and treatment process. Despite significant anatomic and embryologic parallels
      between men and women, the multifaceted nature of female sexual dysfunction
      clearly is distinct from that of the man. The clinician cannot approach female
      patients or their sexual function problems in the same fashion as in male
      patients. The context in which a woman experiences her sexuality is equally if
      not more important than the physiologic outcome she experiences, and these issues
      should be determined before beginning medical therapy or determining treatment
      efficacies.

TI  - Amiodarone versus diltiazem for rate control in critically ill patients with
      atrial tachyarrhythmias.
PG  - 1149-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the rate-lowering effect of diltiazem and two amiodarone
      regimens in critically ill patients with recent-onset atrial tachyarrhythmias.
      DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study. SETTING: Medical cardiologic
      intensive care unit in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty critically ill
      patients (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] III score 70
      +/- 30, age 67 +/- 10 yrs). INTERVENTIONS: Patients with atrial fibrillation (n =
      57), atrial flutter (n = 2), or atrial tachycardia (n = 1, and a heart rate
      consistently >120 beats/min over 30 mins were randomly assigned to one of three
      intravenous treatment regimens. Group 1 received diltiazem in a 25-mg bolus
      followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/hr for 24 hrs, group 2 received
      amiodarone in a 300-mg bolus, and group 3 received amiodarone in a 300-mg bolus
      followed by 45 mg/hr for 24 hrs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary study
      end point was a >30% rate reduction within 4 hrs. The secondary study end point
      was a heart rate <120 beats/min (a patient was considered to have uncontrolled
      tachycardia if heart rate was >120 beats/min 4 hrs after study drug). The primary
      study end point was achieved in 14/20 (70%), 11/20 (55%), and 15/20 (75%) of
      patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (chi2 = 1.95, p =.38). Uncontrolled 
      tachycardia was more frequently observed in group 2 (0/20, 9/29 [55%], and 1/20
      [5%] of patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; chi2 = 17, p =.00016). In
      patients achieving tachycardia control, diltiazem showed a significantly better
      rate reduction (p =.0001 group 1 vs. group 3, p =.0001 over time; p =.0001 group 
      1 vs. group 2, p =.001 over time) when compared with the amiodarone groups.
      Premature drug discontinuation due to hypotension was required significantly more
      often in group 1 (6/20 [30%], 0/20, and 1/20 [5%] for groups 1, 2, and 3,
      respectively; chi2 = 10, p =.01). CONCLUSION: Sufficient rate control can be
      achieved in critically ill patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias using either
      diltiazem or amiodarone. Although diltiazem allowed for significantly better
      24-hr heart rate control, this effect was offset by a significantly higher
      incidence of hypotension requiring discontinuation of the drug. Amiodarone may be
      an alternative in patients with severe hemodynamic compromise.

TI  - Isradipine improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation in normotensive coronary
      artery disease patients with hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 899-905
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The dihydropyridine calcium antagonist isradipine has
      anti-atherosclerotic effects in animals and improves endothelium-mediated nitric 
      oxide (NO)-dependent vasodilation in vitro. As improved endothelial function may 
      be beneficial we investigated its effects in patients with a high likelihood of
      endothelial dysfunction. DESIGN: Thirty patients (two female, age 55.4 +/- 10.5
      years) with known coronary artery disease and elevated (> 6 mmol/l) total
      cholesterol (cholesterol: mean 6.7 +/- 0.78 mmol/l) or a cholesterol/high density
      lipoproteins (HDL) ratio of > 5 not on lipid lowering therapy, participated in
      the study. Endothelial vasodilator function was assessed before and after
      double-blind, randomized administration of isradipine 5 mg/day or placebo for 3
      months. METHODS: Endothelial function was assessed as forearm blood flow (FBF,
      venous occlusion plethysmography) responses to graded brachial artery infusions
      of acetylcholine (Ach), to the NO-synthase blocker NG-monomethyl-L-arginine
      (L-NMMA) and to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside
      (SNP). Blood pressure was measured either directly from the brachial arterial or 
      by sphygmomanometer during clinic visits. RESULTS: Blood pressure was unchanged
      in both groups after 3 months (isradipine: 88.8 versus 92.1 mmHg; placebo: 81.0
      versus 82.5 mmHg; NS) but cholesterol levels decreased similarly in both groups
      (isradipine: 6.7 versus 6.1 mmol/l, NS; placebo: 6.6 versus 5.9 mmol/l, P< 0.05).
      The vasodilator response to SNP and the decrease in FBF in response to blockade
      of NO synthesis by L-NMMA were unchanged in both groups. However, isradipine, but
      not placebo, enhanced the NO-dependent vasodilator response to Ach (P < 0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Isradipine improves acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation in
      hypercholesterolemic patients independent of changes in lipids or blood pressure.

TI  - Effects of amlodipine on baroreflex and sympathetic nervous system activity in
      mild-to-moderate hypertension.
PG  - 424-8
AB  - To investigate the effect of amlodipine on baroreflex sensitivity and sympathetic
      system activity, 36 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to
      once-daily, double-blind treatment with amlodipine 5 mg or placebo 5 mg for 60
      days. Measurements with a Finapres device allowed calculation of baroreflex
      sensitivity and blood pressure (BP) variability. Adrenergic activity was assessed
      via measurements of lymphocyte beta2-adrenoceptors and plasma catecholamine
      concentrations. Compared with placebo, amlodipine significantly decreased BP, but
      did not significantly alter baroreflex sensitivity. Spectral analysis of Finapres
      data showed that, compared with placebo, amlodipine decreased the variability of 
      systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and RR interval in the low
      frequency band. There were no simultaneous changes in adrenergic function,
      however, suggesting that these effects of amlodipine were not mediated via
      sympathetic nervous system activation.

TI  - The current status of antihypertensive treatments: into the new millennium.
PG  - 731-7
AB  - In this short review, we present a historical perspective of the treatment of
      hypertension, highlight some current issues and look to the possible future of
      antihypertensive therapy. The distribution of blood pressure within the
      population adopts a continuous, albeit somewhat skewed, distribution, so what
      constitutes hypertension? Conventionally, the disease has been defined as a level
      of blood pressure >> 140/90 mmHg. Accepting this 'arbitrary' definition infers
      that approximately one quarter of the adult population in the US are hypertensive
      [1]. This has significant implications in terms of the impact upon public health.
      We know that treatment of hypertension can prevent the serious consequences of
      cardiovascular disease: stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure and
      renal disease. Thus, it is important that raised blood pressure is both detected 
      and effectively lowered. To what level should blood pressure be reduced.
      Conventionally, a level of 120/80 mmHg has been used to define normotension but
      there are indications that under certain circumstances this should not be the
      target. The question also arises as to whether it matters how blood pressure is
      treated. The choice of agent may ultimately depend upon the presence of any
      concomitant condition and risk factors. Recent trial evidence has concluded that 
      therapy selected to treat raised blood pressure should take into account the
      overall cardiovascular risk profile of the patient [2].

TI  - Amlodipine/benazepril: fixed dose combination therapy for hypertension.
PG  - 165-78
AB  - Myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and end-stage renal disease have all
      been linked to inadequate control of blood pressure. Despite overwhelming
      evidence that uncontrolled hypertension is responsible for a sizeable number of
      adverse health-related outcomes, control of the disease remains considerably
      suboptimal. Available data demonstrate that in order to achieve adequate blood
      pressure control, a large number of patients require therapy with more than one
      medication. Fixed dose combination antihypertensive therapy has many advantages
      over other treatment options. Positive effects on blood pressure control, rates
      of adherence, adverse effects and cost have been identified.
      Amlodipine/benazepril (Lotrel), Novartis) is a fixed dose combination product
      indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Although not currently recommended
      as first-line therapy, studies confirm that this combination of a long-acting
      calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor possesses
      substantial blood pressure lowering capabilities. Whereas adverse events tend to 
      become more frequent with increasing doses of antihypertensive monotherapy, the
      rate of adverse events attributed to amlodipine/benazepril in clinical trials
      often correlates with rates ascribed to placebo. Amlodipine/benazepril is capable
      of sustaining blood pressure control over a 24 h period and appears to be
      minimally affected by an occasional dose omission. Unlike the older calcium
      antagonists, amlodipine is unlikely to cause alterations in myocardial
      contractility. Additionally, the amlodipine/benazepril combination product costs 
      less than the same therapy administered as the individual components. It is,
      therefore, reasonable to consider therapy with amlodipine/benazepril in
      appropriate patients after an adequate trial of antihypertensive monotherapy.

      artery of patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 547-51
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of acute blood pressure reduction on
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the peripheral circulation of essential
      hypertensive patients. DESIGN: A parallel group study; endothelial function
      measured in 64 essential hypertensive patients before and after (2 h) treatment
      with nifedipine (20 mg, n = 32) or captopril (50 mg, n = 32), p.o., randomly
      assigned. METHODS: In hypertensive patients, we evaluated flow-mediated,
      endothelium-dependent dilation (FMD, high resolution ultrasound) of the brachial 
      artery compared with endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate
      (GTN, 25 microg s.l.). Automatic computerized analysis was used to measure
      brachial artery diameter on end-diastolic frames acquired every second during the
      study. Sixty-six healthy normotensive subjects were also evaluated to assess the 
      presence of endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients. RESULTS:
      Hypertensive patients showed a significantly (P< 0.01) lower FMD (5.9 +/- 2.5%)
      as compared to healthy controls (7.7 +/- 3.8%). The response to GTN was similar
      in normotensive subjects (7.5 +/- 3.1%) and hypertensive patients (7.2 +/- 6.5%).
      At baseline brachial artery diameter, FMD and response to GTN were similar in the
      nifedipine- and captopril-treated groups. Nifedipine and captopril similarly
      reduced blood pressure, but only nifedipine increased heart rate. Acute
      nifedipine, but not captopril, significantly (P< 0.01) increased brachial artery 
      diameter, while FMD and response to GTN were not modified after nifedipine or
      captopril. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial dysfunction in the brachial artery of
      essential hypertensive patients is not improved by acute blood pressure
      reduction.

TI  - Improved efficacy and safety of controlled-release diltiazem compared to
      nifedipine may be related to its negative chronotropic effect.
PG  - 17-22
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of long-acting 
      preparations of two commonly used calcium antagonists with particular reference
      to their effects on heart rate. Twenty patients with chronic stable angina were
      recruited to a double-blind, double-dummy crossover study of controlled-release
      diltiazem (diltiazem CR) versus sustained-release nifedipine (nifedipine SR) and 
      underwent clinical assessment, symptom and adverse event reporting, and repeated 
      treadmill exercise tests over a 10- to 11-week period. The main outcome measures 
      were heart rate at rest and exercise, incidence of angina and nitroglycerin use, 
      treadmill exercise performance (duration, time to angina, time to 1-mm ST-segment
      depression, heart rate at equivalent maximal exercise, and maximal ST-segment
      depression), and adverse events. Diltiazem CR significantly reduced heart rate at
      rest and equivalent exercise and incidence of angina and nitroglycerin use
      compared with nifedipine SR. Exercise duration time to angina and time to 1-mm
      ST-segment depression (but not maximal ST-segment depression) were all
      significantly improved by diltiazem CR. Diltiazem CR also caused significantly
      fewer adverse events than nifedipine SR. Calcium antagonists with negative
      chronotropic effects (eg, diltiazem CR) are safer and more efficacious as
      monotherapy in chronic stable angina than dihydropyridines (eg, nifedipine SR)
      even when a long-acting formulation of the latter is used.

TI  - Chronotherapeutic delivery of verapamil in obese versus non-obese patients with
      essential hypertension.
PG  - 135-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of controlled-onset, extended-release (COER) verapamil on 
      haemodynamic parameters in obese and non-obese patients is evaluated in this
      analysis. METHODS: Data were pooled from three clinical trials evaluating
      efficacy and tolerability of COER-verapamil. Hypertensive men and women (stage I 
      to III) were randomised to COER-verapamil (180-540 mg at bedtime) or placebo for 
      4-8 weeks and stratified according to body mass index (BMI-obese > 28 kg/m2).
      Efficacy was assessed as change from baseline in blood pressure (BP), heart rate,
      and rate-pressure product during four time periods throughout the dosing
      interval. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring all adverse events 
      and changes in metabolic laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Reductions in all
      haemodynamic parameters were significantly greater following COER-verapamil
      compared with placebo for all time periods. The haemodynamic effects of
      COER-verapamil in obese (n = 166, BMI = 32.8 kg/m2) and non-obese patients (n =
      115, BMI = 25.0 kg/m2) were similar. COER-verapamil was well tolerated in both
      subgroups, but the incidence of constipation was significantly less in obese
      patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COER-verapamil is effective in reducing BP,
      heart rate, and rate-pressure product independently of BMI.

TI  - A retrospective analysis comparing the costs and cost effectiveness of amlodipine
      and enalapril in the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 82-7
AB  - A comparison of treatment costs and cost effectiveness was performed
      retrospectively by using patient-level data from a randomized, controlled,
      one-year clinical trial of amlodipine and enalapril in the treatment of
      mild-to-moderate hypertension. Unit costs of amlodipine and enalapril were
      applied to the daily dosages of individual patients to calculate the total costs 
      and average costs per patient in each treatment group in the clinical trial on an
      intent-to-treat basis. Efficacy rates were used to calculate the average
      treatment costs per success in blood pressure control. Although not statistically
      significant, amlodipine treatment resulted in a higher efficacy (89.5%) vs.
      enalapril (85.2%). The average costs per amlodipine-treated patient were
      consistently lower (-$112.30) than for the enalapril-treated patient by week 50. 
      Treatment with amlodipine resulted in an average cost per success of $609 per
      patient compared with $772 per enalapril-treated patient. A sensitivity analysis 
      revealed that, in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension over the 50-week
      treatment period, amlodipine would remain less costly than enalapril, with a
      decrease in the cost of enalapril of up to 17%, and would remain more cost
      effective, with a 21% decrease in the cost of enalapril.

TI  - Clinical features and natural history of nonalcoholic steatosis syndromes.
PG  - 17-26
AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, along with other forms of nonalcoholic fatty liver 
      disease, is a chronic liver disease that is attracting increasing significance.
      It is a clinicopathologic syndrome that was originally described in obese,
      diabetic females who denied alcohol use but in whom the hepatic histology was
      consistent with alcoholic hepatitis. This typical patient profile has been
      expanded and is now recognized to occur even in normal weight males without overt
      abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism. Although originally believed to be a
      benign clinical entity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is now recognized as a cause
      of progressive fibrotic liver disease with adverse clinical sequelae. It is
      important to emphasize that nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is best considered one
      type of a larger spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that is a
      consequence of insulin resistance and ranges from fat alone to fat plus
      inflammation, fat plus ballooning degeneration, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis,
      the latter being the most serious form. As with any disease, the clinical
      importance of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is related to its prevalence and
      natural history. Recent studies using different methodologies indicate that in
      the general population the prevalence of fatty liver and nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis is approximately 20% and 3%, respectively. These prevalence rates
      are increased in certain subpopulations such as obesity and type II diabetes. Of 
      greater concern is the recognition that cirrhosis and liver-related deaths occur 
      in approximately 20% and 8% of these patients, respectively, over a 10-year
      period. Risk factors for these adverse clinical symptoms include patients older
      than the age of 45, the presence of diabetes or obesity, an aspartate
      aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio > 1 and hepatic histology.
      However, a number of important unresolved issues must be clarified before the
      true natural history of this disease can be fully understood.

TI  - Efficacy of different drug classes used to initiate antihypertensive treatment in
      black subjects: results of a randomized trial in Johannesburg, South Africa.
PG  - 965-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thiazides are recommended to initiate antihypertensive drug treatment
      in black subjects. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of this recommendation in a
      South African black cohort. METHODS: Men and women (N = 409), aged 18 to 70
      years, with a mean ambulatory daytime diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 114
      mm Hg, were randomized to 13 months of open-label treatment starting with the
      nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (30 mg/d, n = 233),
      sustained-release verapamil hydrochloride (240 mg/d, n = 58), hydrochlorothiazide
      (12.5 mg/d, n = 58), or enalapril maleate (10 mg/d, n = 60). If the target of
      reducing daytime diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg was not attained, the
      first-line drugs were titrated up and after 2 months other medications were added
      to the regimen. RESULTS: While receiving monotherapy (2 months, n = 366), the
      patients' systolic and diastolic decreases in daytime blood pressure averaged
      22/14 mm Hg for nifedipine, 17/11 mm Hg for verapamil, 12/8 mm Hg for
      hydrochlorothiazide, and 5/3 mm Hg for enalapril. At 2 months the blood pressure 
      of more patients treated with nifedipine was controlled: 133 (63.3%, P</=.03) vs 
      20 (39.9%) receiving verapamil, 21 (40.4%) receiving hydrochlorothiazide, and 11 
      (20.8%) receiving enalapril. At 13 months (n = 257), more patients (P<.001)
      continued receiving monotherapy with nifedipine (94/154 [61.0%]) or verapamil
      (22/35 [62.9%]) than hydrochlorothiazide (10/39 [25.6%]) or enalapril (1/29
      [3.4%]). A sustained decrease of left ventricular mass (P<.001) with no
      between-group differences was achieved at 4 and 13 months. CONCLUSIONS: In
      contrast to current recommendations, calcium channel blockers are more effective 
      than thiazides as initial treatment in black subjects with hypertension. If
      treatment is started with thiazides or converting-enzyme inhibitors, combination 
      therapy is more likely to be required to control blood pressure and reduce left
      ventricular mass.

TI  - Mitotic activity of keratinocytes in nifedipine- and immunosuppressive
      medication-induced gingival overgrowth.
PG  - 167-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to compare mitotic activity in the basal
      cell layer of normal human gingiva and in nifedipine- and immunosuppressive
      medication-induced gingival overgrowth. METHODS: Gingival samples were collected 
      from 19 generally healthy individuals, 12 nifedipine-medicated cardiac patients, 
      and 22 immunosuppression-medicated (azathioprine, prednisolone, and cyclosporin
      A) organ transplant recipients. The transplant recipients were divided into those
      not taking nifedipine and those taking nifedipine. Cryostat sections were stained
      with monoclonal antibody for Ki-67, using an avidin-biotin-enzyme complex method.
      The mitotic activities of epithelial cells were determined as percentages of
      Ki-67 labeled cells in relation to total numbers of epithelial cells in the basal
      layer of oral, oral sulcular, and sulcular epithelium. RESULTS: Mitotic
      activities were significantly higher in all 3 medication groups in the oral
      epithelium (P < or =0.003), and in the immunosuppression group in the sulcular
      epithelium (P= 0.032) than in the controls. In the oral sulcular epithelium,
      mitotic activity was fairly similar in all medication groups. In the nifedipine
      group a significant negative correlation was found between duration of nifedipine
      medication and the percentage of Ki-67 labeled cells in the oral epithelium (P=
      0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the increased epithelial thickness 
      observed in nifedipine- and cyclosporin A-induced gingival overgrowth is
      associated with increased mitotic activity, especially in the oral epithelium.

TI  - Macrophages and lymphocyte subpopulations in nifedipine- and cyclosporin
      A-associated human gingival overgrowth.
PG  - 160-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nifedipine and cyclosporin A (CsA) induce gingival overgrowth. Both
      drugs have immunomodulating effects. It has been suggested that altered immune
      response is associated with drug-induced gingival overgrowth. In this study, we
      evaluated whether there were differences in macrophages and lymphocyte
      subpopulations in human nifedipine- and CsA-associated gingival overgrowth as
      compared with those in normal gingiva. METHODS: Biopsy samples of overgrown
      gingiva were obtained from 9 nifedipine-treated cardiac outpatients, 13
      CsA-treated renal transplant recipients including 9 patients who were also
      receiving nifedipine, and 30 healthy control individuals undergoing dental
      treatment. Serial 5 microm thick cryostat sections were stained with mAbs for
      CD20 (B-pan), CD68 (macrophages), CD4 (T-helper/inducer), and CD8
      (T-cytotoxic/suppressor) using an avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex
      method. Numbers of mAb-labeled and all nucleated cells were determined in 3
      areas: the connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium, the middle
      connective tissue, and the connective tissue beneath the oral epithelium.
      Distributions of each type of cell were expressed as percentages of mAb-labeled
      cells in relation to total number of nucleated cells in a counting zone.
      Significances of differences between groups were tested by means of the
      Kruskal-Wallis test, and between pairs of results by means of the Mann-Whitney
      U-test. RESULTS: The proportion of CD8-labeled cells was significantly higher in 
      connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium in the nifedipine group than in
      the controls (P = 0.014). In both medicated groups, the proportions of
      CD68-labeled cells were higher in all counting zones than in the controls, but
      statistically significantly only in the nifedipine group in the connective tissue
      beneath the oral epithelium (P = 0.008). No intergroup differences were found
      with respect to CD4- and CD20-labeled cells. The CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly 
      lower in connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium in the nifedipine
      group than in the controls (P= 0.013). CONCLUSION: The results support the idea
      that immune response may be altered in drug-induced gingival overgrowth.

TI  - Comparison of two calcium blockers on hemodynamics, left ventricular mass, and
      coronary vasodilatory in advanced hypertension.
PG  - 231-40
AB  - Dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) differ in
      pharmacologic characteristics. Few clinical studies distinguish effects of CCB as
      monotherapy. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of two CCB on patients with 
      moderate to severe hypertension. Thirty patients with pretreatment diastolic
      blood pressures > or = 100 mm Hg were randomly assigned to either nifedipine-GITS
      or verapamil-SR. Dose titration achieved a diastolic blood pressure of < or = 95 
      mm Hg or a decrease of > or = 15 mm Hg over 4 weeks. Clinic blood pressure (BP), 
      24-h ambulatory BP, exercise BP, left ventricular mass, systolic and diastolic
      function by echocardiography, and coronary flow reserve by split-dose
      thallium-201 imaging with adenosine were assessed at baseline, end of titration, 
      3 months and 6 months of treatment. Plasma renin activity, atrial natriuretic
      peptide, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were assayed. Both drugs caused similar 
      reductions in clinic and 24-h ambulatory BP and similar reductions in left
      ventricular mass index. Compared to nifedipine-GITS, verapamil-SR produced a
      significantly lower resting and peak exercise heart rate. Nifedipine-GITS
      elicited a lower peak exercise systolic BP. At end titration nifedipine-GITS
      produced lower plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels, no longer apparent by 6 
      months. Plasma norepinephrine was lower with verapamil-SR, also at end titration 
      and at 3 months, but not at 6 months. Plasma epinephrine and plasma renin
      activity were unchanged by either drug. There was no difference for systolic or
      diastolic left ventricular function or coronary flow reserve between the two
      treatments. Once daily nifedipine-GITS and verapamil-SR are equally effective for
      reduction of arterial pressure in moderate to severe hypertension. Differences in
      their hemodynamic profiles and neurohormonal responses are consistent with
      preclinical pharmacologic characteristics. The clinical implications of their
      similarities and differences remain to be fully evaluated in outcome studies.

TI  - Testing the effectiveness of converting patients to long-acting antianginal
      medications: The Quality of Life in Angina Research Trial (QUART).
PG  - 550-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that converting patients with
      stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications would improve their
      functional status, symptom control, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-blind randomized trial of 100 patients with stable 
      coronary artery disease was performed in the outpatient clinic of a Veterans
      Affairs Health System. Outpatients with chronic stable angina taking at least 2
      antianginal medications were studied. Patients were randomized to one of two
      treatments: optimal adjustment of their usual antianginal medications or
      conversion to solely long-acting medications (long-acting diltiazem +/-
      nitroglycerin patches +/- atenolol) with subsequent optimization. The primary
      outcome was the 3-month change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores. Although
      no differences in physical limitation scores were noted, patients randomized to
      receive long-acting medications had improved symptom control (3-month improvement
      in anginal stability [19.1 vs 5.6, P =.02] and anginal frequency [17.8 vs 5.5, P 
      =.006]), more treatment satisfaction (3-month improvement of 8.2 vs 3.0, P
      =.057), and better quality of life (3-month improvement of 11.2 vs 5.6, P =.09)
      compared with patients whose pretrial medications were optimized. The improvement
      in symptom control was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Converting patients
      with chronic, stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications resulted in
      substantial improvements in symptom control with a trend toward better treatment 
      satisfaction and quality of life.

TI  - Comparative effects of amlodipine and nifedipine GITS during treatment and after 
      missing two doses.
PG  - 47-57
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine and nifedipine 
      gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) measured by office and ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) during treatment and, after patients have missed
      two doses. METHOD: After a single blind run-in 4-week placebo period, 58 patients
      were randomly allocated to amlodipine (5mg/daily, n=30) or nifedipine GITS
      (30mg/daily; n=28) in a double-blind, double dummy fashion. Patients received
      active medication for 4 weeks. Then, to simulate failure of compliance, patients 
      received two single blinded doses of placebo. Ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring was carried out at the end of run-in placebo phase, the first day, the
      last day of active treatment and up to 72h after the last active dose. RESULTS:
      Diastolic blood pressure was controlled in 61.9% patients on amlodipine and 52.9%
      on nifedipine GITS. Reductions in blood pressure were similar in both groups.
      ABPM showed significant reduction in blood pressure from the first day in the
      nifedipine GITS group, while amlodipine group had marginal effect. Peak reduction
      in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 26/15mmHg at 5-6h after ingestion of
      amlodipine tablets. The trough reduction was 22/13mmHg; with a trough-to-peak
      ratio of 84.61% for systolic and 86.67% for diastolic blood pressure. Peak
      reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with nifedipine GITS was 19/15mmHg
      and the trough reduction was 21/17mmHg, giving a trough-to-peak ratio of 100% for
      both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. When patients received placebo after 
      4 weeks of active treatment, simulating a compliance failure, amlodipine
      maintained reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure for at least up to 
      72h after the last active dose, maintaining 57.71% of the effect for systolic
      blood pressure and 60.00% for diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, nifedipine
      GITS effect was rapidly lost during this study phase, with a reduction in
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure of only 14-16%, 72h after the last active
      dose. CONCLUSION: This study showed that amlodipine and nifedipine GITS reduce
      blood pressure to about the same extent during chronic treatment. In the case of 
      compliance failure, such as missing one or two doses, amlodipine maintained
      significant and important antihypertensive effect with the trough-to-peak ratio
      still over 50% 72h after the last active dose. On the other hand, the coverage of
      nifedipine GITS was limited to about 36h after the last active dose.

TI  - [Treatment of renal hypertension].
PG  - 297-300
AB  - In recent years in conjunction with medicamentous treatment of renoparenchymatous
      hypertension in particular two problems were discussed: target blood pressure
      values and renoprotective effects of antihypertensive drugs. Prospective studies 
      revealed that a blood pressure reading of < 130/80 mm Hg significantly retards
      the progression of nephropathy whereby patients with proteinuria > 1 g/d benefit 
      from even lower BP readings. In diabetic nephropathy the drugs of choice are
      inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEI), already in the incipient
      stage and also in normotensive patients. The importance of ACEI in the treatment 
      of non-diabetic nephropathies was confirmed recently by controlled prospective
      studies AIPRI and REIN. A maximal renoprotective effect of ACEI probably calls
      for larger doses than those needed for normalization of BP. Long-term
      investigations of the renoprotective effect of antagonists of angiotensin AT1
      receptors and comparative studies with ACEI resp. are not available.
      Dihydropyridine blockers of calcium channels with a short-term action
      (nifedipine) may have a negative influence on the progression of diabetic
      nephropathy, the effect of dihydropyridines of the second generation is tested in
      prospective studies. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have a
      renoprotective action in diabetic nephropathy. In cca two thirds of the patients 
      combined treatment with ACEI and diuretics or with calcium channel blockers is
      necessary. As to other antihypertensive drugs, vasodilatating beta-blockers and
      perspectively antagonists of endothelin receptors are useful.

TI  - The long-term efficacy and safety profile of barnidipine.
PG  - 20-6
AB  - Two multicentre trials have investigated the efficacy and tolerability of
      treatment with once-daily barnidipine, in patients with mild to moderate
      essential hypertension. The long-term efficacy and safety of barnidipine were
      demonstrated in a long-term, multicentre, open-label study. In total, 106, 79 and
      32 patients were followed for the first, second and third year, respectively.
      Patients received barnidipine at a dose titrated to achieve a sitting DBP > or = 
      90 mmHg or a decrease in sitting BDP > or = 10 mmHg. If necessary, another
      antihypertensive agent was added to achieve normalisation of blood pressure. In
      the first year, normalisation of blood pressure was achieved in 91% of patients. 
      This was maintained in 91% and 81% of patients in the second and third years,
      respectively. At the end of treatment in both years, over 60% of patients
      remained on barnidipine monotherapy (10 or 20 mg/day). A low incidence of adverse
      events possibly or probably related to barnidipine (10 or 20 mg/day) monotherapy 
      was reported in the first and second years with headache, peripheral oedema and
      palpitations the most commonly reported. In the third year of follow-up, only one
      adverse event, an ECG abnormality, was considered to be possibly related to the
      study medication. The effective 24 hour control of blood pressure with
      barnidipine monotherapy was confirmed in a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over study of 20 patients. These patients were given 6 
      week regimens of both barnidipine (20 mg/day) and placebo. Office and 24 hour
      ambulatory blood pressures were recorded at the end of each treatment phase.
      Barnidipine lowered blood pressure to a significantly greater extent than placebo
      both at night and during the day. Adverse events were classified as mild or
      moderate and fewer adverse events were reported with barnidipine treatment
      compared with placebo. Barnidipine monotherapy (20 mg/day) is safe and effective 
      in providing 24 hour control of blood pressure. Furthermore, the efficacy and
      tolerability of barnidipine monotherapy (10 or 20 mg/day) are maintained for at
      least 2 years.

TI  - Blood pressure control in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension
      switched from nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) 30 mg to
      nifedipine GITS 20 mg.
PG  - 87-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) is a once-daily
      formulation of nifedipine that provides sustained plasma nifedipine
      concentrations throughout the 24-hour dosing interval. OBJECTIVE: This study was 
      undertaken to determine if adult patients with mild to moderate essential
      hypertension whose blood pressure had been controlled for > or = 3 months with
      nifedipine GITS 30 mg could be successfully switched to a 20-mg daily dose with
      continued antihypertensive efficacy. METHODS: This was a randomized,
      double-blind, parallel-group study. Patients entered a 1-week run-in period
      during which they continued to receive their usual antihypertensive medication,
      including nifedipine GITS 30 mg. After baseline assessment, patients entered a
      6-week treatment period during which they were randomly assigned to receive
      nifedipine GITS 30 or 20 mg. Men and women were eligible to participate if they
      were > or = 55 years of age, had received a diagnosis of mild to moderate
      essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 95-114 mm Hg), and
      had exhibited good blood pressure control (sitting DBP < or = 90 mm Hg) while
      taking nifedipine GITS 30 mg once daily for > or = 3 months. Systolic blood
      pressure (SBP), DBP, and heart rate were recorded at baseline and after 1, 3, and
      6 weeks of treatment. Adverse events were reported by patients. The responder
      rate was defined as the percentage of patients whose sitting DBP was < 95 mm Hg
      at the final study assessment. Results were based on the intent-to-treat
      analyses, which included data for all patients who received > or = 1 dose and had
      1 postbaseline blood pressure assessment. Statistical significance was set at P <
      0.05. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients entered the 1-week run-in period; 71
      patients (94.7%) were randomized to treatment. Twenty-four patients received
      nifedipine GITS 30 mg for 43.0 +/- 3.3 days, and 47 patients received nifedipine 
      GITS 20 mg for 42.5 +/- 6.7 days. Both groups exhibited a sustained decrease in
      blood pressure throughout the study; minor variations were not statistically
      significant. End-point SBP and DBP for the 30- and 20-mg groups were 135.5 +/-
      9.8/81.7 +/- 5.4 mm Hg and 138.6 +/- 11.8/82.9 +/- 7.6 mm Hg, respectively.
      Changes from baseline in end-point SBP and DBP did not differ significantly
      between groups. At the end of treatment, goal DBP (< 95 mm Hg) was achieved by 24
      of 24 patients (100%) receiving the 30-mg dose and 45 of 47 patients (95.7%)
      receiving the 20-mg dose. Blood pressure control (sitting DBP < 90 mm Hg) was
      achieved by 21 of 24 (87.5%) patients in the 30-mg group and 35 of 47 (74.5%)
      patients in the 20-mg group. The most commonly reported adverse event was
      headache; 2 patients discontinued the study because of adverse events. Overall, 9
      of 24 patients (37.5%) in the 30-mg group and 14 of 47 patients (29.8%) in the
      20-mg group experienced > or = 1 treatment-related adverse event. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients whose mild to moderate essential hypertension is controlled with
      nifedipine GITS 30 mg once daily may be able to switch to 20 mg once daily with
      continued antihypertensive efficacy. In addition to safety and economic
      advantages, such a switch may be a reasonable alternative in patients with lower 
      body weight or as an adjunct to existing antihypertensive therapy.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of out-of-hospital self-administered single-dose oral drug
      treatment in the management of infrequent, well-tolerated paroxysmal
      supraventricular tachycardia.
PG  - 548-53
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We tested the efficacy of two drug treatments, flecainide (F) and the
      combination ofdiltiazem and propranolol (D/P), administered as a single oral dose
      for termination of the arrhythmic episodes. BACKGROUND: Both prophylactic drug
      therapy and catheter ablation are questionable as first-line treatments in
      patients with infrequent and well-tolerated episodes of paroxysmal
      supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). METHODS: Among 42 eligible patients (13% of
      all screened for SVT) with infrequent (< or =5/year), well-tolerated and
      long-lasting episodes, 37 were enrolled and 33 had SVT inducible during
      electrophysiological study. In the latter, three treatments (placebo, F, and D/P)
      were administered in a random order 5 min after SVT induction on three different 
      days. RESULTS: Conversion to sinus rhythm occurred within 2 h in 52%, 61%, and
      94% of patients on placebo, F and D/P, respectively (p < 0.001). The conversion
      time was shorter after D/P (32 +/- 22 min) than after placebo (77 +/- 42 min, p <
      0.001) or F (74 +/- 37 min, p < 0.001). Four patients (1 placebo, 1 D/P, and 2 F)
      had hypotension and four (3 D/P and 1 F) a sinus rate <50 beats/min following SVT
      interruption. Patients were discharged on a single oral dose of the most
      effective drug treatment (F or D/P) at time of acute testing. Twenty-six patients
      were discharged on D/P and five on F. During 17 +/- 12 months follow-up, the
      treatment was successful in 81% of D/P patients and in 80% of F patients, as all 
      the arrhythmic episodes were interrupted out-of-hospital within 2 h. In the
      remaining patients, a failure occurred during one or more episodes because of
      drug ineffectiveness or drug unavailability. One patient had syncope after D/P
      ingestion. During follow-up, the percentage of patients calling for emergency
      room assistance was significantly reduced as compared to the year before
      enrollment (9% vs. 100%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The episodic treatment with
      oral D/P and F, as assessed during acute testing, appears effective in the
      management of selected patients with SVT. This therapeutic strategy minimizes the
      need for emergency room admissions during tachycardia recurrences.

TI  - A comparison of indapamide SR 1.5 mg with both amlodipine 5 mg and
      hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in elderly hypertensive patients: a randomized
      double-blind controlled study.
PG  - 343-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the efficacy of indapamide sustained-release (SR) 1.5 mg in
      reducing blood pressure versus amlodipine 5 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, in 
      elderly hypertensive patients. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, 12 week study
      using three parallel groups. SETTING: European teaching hospitals and general
      practices. PATIENTS: Randomized patients, (n = 524) including 128 patients with
      isolated systolic hypertension (ISH); mean age: 72.4 years; mean
      systolic/diastolic blood pressures (SBP/DBP): 174.5/97.9 mmHg. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure variations. RESULTS:
      Indapamide SR 1.5 mg demonstrates a similar efficacy to that of amlodipine 5 mg, 
      as well as to that of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (equivalence P < 0.001); the mean
      decreases in SBP/DBP were -22.7/-11.8 mmHg, -22.2/-10.7 mmHg and -19.4/-10.8
      mmHg, respectively. In the ISH subgroup, indapamide SR 1.5 mg tends to have
      greater efficacy than hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in reducing the SBP (-24.7 versus
      -18.5 mmHg, respectively; equivalence P = 0.117), while similar results are
      obtained with amlodipine 5 mg (-23 mmHg, equivalence P < 0.001). The
      normalization rate was relatively high for indapamide SR 1.5 mg (75.3%), when
      compared with amlodipine (66.9%) and hydrochlorothiazide (67.3%), especially in
      the subgroup of isolated systolic hypertensive patients: 84.2 versus 80.0% for
      amlodipine, and versus 71.4% for hydrochlorothiazide. CONCLUSIONS: Indapamide SR 
      1.5 mg shows similar antihypertensive efficacy to amlodipine 5 mg and
      hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in elderly hypertensive patients, while in patients
      with isolated systolic hypertension, indapamide SR 1.5 mg shows a similar
      efficacy to amlodipine 5 mg but a greater efficacy than hydrochlorothiazide 25
      mg.

TI  - Effects of short- and long-acting calcium channel blockers on the relationship
      between blood pressure and physical activity.
PG  - 66-9
AB  - Calcium channel blockers are widely used as antihypertensive drugs. However,
      there is some controversy as to how they should be used. Our first aim was to
      clarify how the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, benidipine, affects the 
      quantitative relationship between blood pressure (BP) and physical activity. The 
      second aim was to determine whether there is a relationship between systolic
      blood pressure (SBP) and physical activity in patients with hypertension when
      treating with a short-acting (nifedipine) or long-acting (benidipine) calcium
      channel blocker. In Study 1, ambulatory BP and physical activity were measured
      simultaneously in 27 patients with hypertension before and after 6 months with
      benidipine. In Study 2, ambulatory BP and physical activity were measured
      simultaneously in 16 patients with hypertension before (placebo) and after 6
      weeks of crossover treatment with nifedipine and benidipine. In Study 1, there
      was no difference in the SBP change caused by physical activity between the pre- 
      and posttreatment periods. In Study 2, SBP was significantly related to physical 
      activity in the placebo (16/16) and benidipine (16/16) groups but not in the
      nifedipine (12/16) group. The lowest BP during day-time and nighttime in the
      nifedipine group were significantly lower than those in the benidipine group.
      Plasma renin activity (ng/mL/h) was significantly higher in the nifedipine group 
      (1.20+/-1.05) than in the placebo (0.57+/-0.59) and benidipine (0.75+/-0.78)
      groups. These findings indicate that nifedipine might interfere with the
      adaptation mechanism of BP changed by physical activity and that the activated
      renin-angiotensin system might cause cardiac events.

TI  - A new chronotherapeutic oral drug absorption system for verapamil optimizes blood
      pressure control in the morning.
PG  - 14-9
AB  - A novel verapamil chronotherapeutic oral drug absorption system (CODAS-Verapamil)
      designed for bedtime dosing and with controlled onset and extended-release
      properties was evaluated in 257 patients with mild-to-moderate essential
      hypertension in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After bedtime 
      dosing (9 PM to 11 PM, this delivery system delays drug release for 4 to 5 h, and
      provides the highest concentrations of verapamil between 6 AM and noon. The study
      results showed that CODAS-verapamil produced its greatest antihypertensive effect
      during this morning period (6 AM to 12 noon) and also provided effective trough
      diastolic blood pressure reductions at 200, 300, and 400 mg. Significant trough
      systolic blood pressure reductions were achieved only with the 300- and 400-mg
      doses. The nighttime dosing regimen was not associated with excessive blood
      pressure (BP) reductions during the sleeping hours, when the antihypertensive
      effect was generally slightly less than that of the 24-h mean reduction. The
      CODAS-verapamil provides enhanced BP reduction during the morning period when
      compared with other time intervals of the 24-h dosing period.

TI  - A comparison of nisoldipine ER and amlodipine for the treatment of mild to
      moderate hypertension.
PG  - 509-13
AB  - This multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised trial compared the
      efficacy and tolerability of nisoldipine extended release (10-40 mg) and
      amlodipine (2.5-10 mg) in 161 patients. The primary end point was a
      between-treatment comparison of change from baseline to week 8 in mean office
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The least squares mean reductions in systolic
      (S)BP/DBP (+/- standard error) for nisoldipine and amlodipine were -11.7/-9.3 +/-
      1.4/0.8 and -14.3/-12.0 +/- 1.4/0.8 mmHg, respectively. The DBP treatment
      difference was 2.7 mmHg (90% confidence interval: 1.1 to 4.3 mmHg; p = 0.005).
      Tolerability profiles were similar between treatments. The drug acquisition cost 
      per mmHg DBP reduction was 40% lower with nisoldipine; an acquisition cost
      analysis revealed that amlodipine was 80% more expensive than nisoldipine for
      treating hypertension. In summary, nisoldipine and amlodipine provide clinically 
      equivalent antihypertensive efficacy; however, nisoldipine is more economical
      than amlodipine.

TI  - Silent ischemic interval on exercise test is a predictor of response to drug
      therapy: a randomized crossover trial of metoprolol versus diltiazem in stable
      angina.
PG  - 45-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: There is no method available to predict the relative
      antianginal efficacy of beta blockers and calcium-channel antagonists. The
      present study was undertaken to assess the role of silent ischemic interval (SII)
      on exercise treadmill test (ETT) as a predictor of response to therapy with
      metoprolol and diltiazem in patients with stable angina. METHODS: Thirty-four
      patients with stable angina were divided into two groups depending upon the
      presence or absence of an SII gap of at least 1 min between onset of ST
      depression and appearance of angina on ETT. Metoprolol (50-100 mg twice daily)
      and diltiazem (60-120 mg three times daily) were randomly assigned for 6 weeks to
      patients in each group, and then patients were crossed over for further 6 weeks
      after a washout period of 2 weeks. Antianginal efficacy was assessed by clinical 
      and exercise parameters. RESULTS: In patients with SII, the clinical responder
      rate was better with metoprolol than with diltiazem (90 vs. 60%, respectively),
      and on ETT, metoprolol produced significant improvement in the total exercise
      time (p< 0.01), time to 1 mm ST depression (p <0.01), time to angina (p <0.01),
      and a significant decrease in peak rate-pressure product (p<0.001), whereas
      diltiazem had no significant effect on exercise parameters. However, in patients 
      without SII, metoprolol and diltiazem had a similar clinical responder rate
      (57%), and both produced a significant increase in total exercise time (p <
      0.01), time to 1 mm ST depression (p < 0.01), and time to angina (p < 0.01). In
      addition, metoprolol had a significant effect on peak rate-pressure product (p < 
      0.001). CONCLUSION: Silent ischemic interval on ETT can be a predictor of
      response to antianginal therapy in stable angina, as patients with SII respond
      better to metoprolol and those without SII respond equally to both metoprolol and
      diltiazem.

TI  - Treatment of hypertension in patients > or =65 years of age: experience with
      amlodipine.
PG  - 1473-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a common finding in patients > or =65 years of age
      that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but many patients are
      untreated or their hypertension inadequately controlled. Recent randomized
      controlled studies have demonstrated the benefits of treating hypertension in the
      elderly. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and
      tolerability of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, in elderly (> 
      or =65 years of age) patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood
      pressure 95 to 114 mm Hg). METHODS: This was an open-label, multicenter, 10-week,
      general-practice study involving patients >18 years of age. Patients with
      malignant or secondary hypertension or unstable angina were excluded, as were
      those who had experienced an acute myocardial infarction or stroke in the
      preceding 3 months or had been treated with an alpha-blocker in the preceding 6
      months. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment schedules: amlodipine
      monotherapy or combination therapy and amlodipine given once daily in the morning
      or in the evening. Approximately 50% of patients would receive a morning dose,
      and approximately 80% would receive amlodipine as monotherapy. The paired t test 
      was used to assess the significance of differences from baseline values, with
      significance set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 5135 patients received
      amlodipine and were included in the tolerability analysis. Of these, 3511 of 3628
      patients (96.8%) <65 years and 1471 of 1507 patients (97.6%) > or =65 years
      (including 336 of 349 [96.3%] > or =75 years) were included in the efficacy
      analysis. Significant reductions (P < 0.05) in blood pressure were noted in all
      groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The equivalence of efficacy in all age
      groups was seen in terms of reduction in blood pressure (reduction of 21/15 mm Hg
      in patients <65 years of age, 25/16 mm Hg in those > or =65 years of age, and
      26/17 mm Hg in those > or =75 years of age) compared with baseline. Therapy was
      successful in 2878 patients (82.0%) <65 years of age, in 1238 patients (84.2%) > 
      or =65 years of age, and in 284 patients (84.5%) > or =75 years of age. The
      incidence of adverse events was similar in all age groups (18.0%, <65 years;
      22.3%, > or =65 years; and 24.1%, > or =75 years), with no statistically
      significant differences between groups. Tolerability was rated as good or
      excellent in all patients, with no significant differences between groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily amlodipine was effective in the treatment of mild to
      moderate hypertension in this patient population and demonstrated a low frequency
      of adverse events, a high degree of tolerability, and improved well-being.
      Morning rather than evening dosing appeared to confer a slight advantage.

TI  - The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of controlled-release
      formulations of felodipine and metoprolol in free and fixed combinations in
      elderly hypertensive patients.
PG  - 529-35
AB  - AIMS: The aims of this study were to study the efficacy and tolerability of
      felodipine extended release (ER) 5 mg and metoprolol controlled release (CR/ZOC) 
      50 mg given as a fixed combination (Logimax) or as a free combination in elderly 
      (age greater than 60 years) hypertensive patients, using ambulatory blood
      pressure (BP) monitoring. A secondary aim was to relate the efficacy of the free 
      and fixed combinations with pharmacokinetic profiles. METHODS: This was a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised three-way crossover multi-centre
      study. BP was measured for 26 h using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      (ABPM), which was performed on the last day of the three treatment phases.
      RESULTS: Mean sitting BPs, measured during the trough period with ABPM, were
      significantly lower with both the free and fixed combinations of metoprolol and
      felodipine than placebo (141/83 mmHg free, 140/83 mmHg fixed, 156/93 mmHg
      placebo). The mean BPs measured over 24 h using ABPM were 143/82 mmHg, 140/82
      mmHg and 158/93 mmHg for the free, fixed and placebo treatment arms,
      respectively. The trough-to-peak ratios (T:P) were 75% and 79% for the systolic
      BP and 70% and 70% for the diastolic BP for the free and fixed combinations,
      respectively. Pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed identical plasma
      concentration-time curves for felodipine given as the free or fixed combination. 
      Comparison of the plasma concentration-time curves for metoprolol revealed a
      delay in the release rate from the fixed combination formulation. No significant 
      differences in BP control between the active treatments were noted during this
      period. Of 26 patients entered into the study, 3 withdrew during active phase for
      non-drug-related reasons. No patient withdrew from active treatment due to
      treatment-related adverse events. The frequency of adverse event reporting for
      the fixed combination of felodipine and metoprolol was similar to that for
      placebo (60% and 58%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that
      once-daily dosing with either the free or fixed combination of felodipine 5 mg
      and metoprolol 50 mg produces a significant sustained reduction in systolic and
      diastolic BP with similar plasma concentration profiles over a 24-h period.

TI  - Prognostic implications of intima-media thickness and plaques in the carotid and 
      femoral arteries in patients with stable angina pectoris.
PG  - 62-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrasonographic assessments of intima-media thickness and plaques in
      the carotid artery are widely used as surrogate markers for coronary
      atherosclerosis, but prospective evaluations are scarce and appear to be lacking 
      in patients with coronary artery disease. Ultrasonographic evaluations of femoral
      vascular changes have not been studied prospectively. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the
      Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm (APSIS), 809 patients with stable angina
      pectoris were studied prospectively during double-blind treatment with verapamil 
      or metoprolol. Ultrasonographic assessments of intima-media thickness, lumen
      diameter and plaques in the carotid and femoral arteries were evaluated in a
      subgroup of 558 patients (182 females) with a mean age of 60 +/-7 years, and
      related to the risk of cardiovascular death (n = 18) or non-fatal myocardial
      infarction (n = 26), or revascularization (n = 70) during follow-up (median 3.0
      years). Univariate Cox regression analyses showed that carotid intima-media
      thickness and plaques were related to the risk of cardiovascular death or
      myocardial infarction. Femoral intima-media thickness was related to
      cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction, as well as to revascularization,
      whereas femoral plaques were only related to the latter. After adjustment for
      age, sex, smoking, previous cardiovascular disease and lipid status, carotid
      intima-media thickness failed to predict any cardiovascular event, whereas
      carotid plaques tended (P = 0.056) to predict the risk of cardiovascular death or
      myocardial infarction. Femoral intima-media thickness (P < 0.01) and plaques (P <
      0.05) were also related to the risk of revascularization after adjustments.
      CONCLUSIONS: Carotid and femoral vascular changes were differently related to
      cardiovascular events. Carotid intima-media thickness was a weak predictor of
      events, whereas femoral intima-media thickness predicted revascularization.
      Plaques in the carotid artery were related to cardiovascular death or non-fatal
      myocardial infarction, whereas plaques in the femoral artery were related to
      revascularization. Evaluations of plaques provided better prediction than
      assessments of intima-media thickness in patients with stable angina.

      slow-onset pharmacological actions, which are probably due to both its slow
      uptake into vascular tissues and resistance in its approach to the calcium
      channel binding site. Vatanidipine once incorporated into vascular tissues is not
      easily released, even by repeated washing, thus resulting in a long-lasting
      action of the agent. A slow-onset and long-lasting hypotensive action was
      observed in various experimental hypertensive models. Clinical trials using human
      subjects with essential hypertension indicated that vatanidipine exerts an
      antihypertensive effect with a slow onset and long duration. In spite of its
      potent hypotensive effect, the incidence of adverse effects by vatanidipine
      administration has been reported to be lower than that in cases of nitrendipine. 
      In addition to its vasodilatory effects, vatanidipine efficiently suppressed
      noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerve endings, thus suggesting this agent 
      exhibits a beneficial effect in the treatment of hypertensive patients, in which 
      the reflex activation of peripheral sympathetic nerves is unfavourable to
      antihypertensive therapy. In a double-blind study, vatanidipine did not show
      reflex tachycardia, despite producing a potent and long-lasting hypotensive
      effect, in contrast to the administration of nitrendipine. In an animal study,
      vatanidipine exhibited a protective effect against cerebrovascular lesions,
      through a mechanism independent of its hypotensive effect. In addition, a
      renoprotective effect was also observed in experimental hypertensive models. In
      cholesterol-fed rabbits, vatanidipine exerted an anti-atherosclerotic action,
      which is probably attributable to the inhibitory action of the agent on
      low-density lipoprotein oxidation. In essential hypertensive patients, the plasma
      levels of cholesterol and triglyceride decreased after vatanidipine treatment,
      thus suggesting that this agent may have a therapeutic potential in preventing
      such vascular diseases as atherosclerosis. Taken together, vatanidipine appears
      to be a novel and useful antihypertensive agent, which can both prevent
      target-organ damage and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Blood pressure reduction associated with preservation of renal function in
      hypertensive patients with IgA nephropathy: a 3-year follow-up.
PG  - 360-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative importance of hypertension in the progression of renal
      failure is well understood. Recently, several studies have provided evidence that
      antihypertensive therapy enhances renal survival. However, the specific
      antihypertensive drug regimens that are most effective in generating such
      long-term effects remain controversial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine
      hypertensive IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients (39 +/- 7 years old, serum
      creatinine 1.1 +/- 0.2 mg/dl) with proteinuria received antihypertensive therapy 
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi: 2.5-10 mg of benazapril
      daily) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs: 2.5-10 mg amlodipine daily) for 3
      years. The patients' blood pressures in group one were controlled below 140/85
      mmHg by increases in their first drug dose or by addition of the second drug in
      group 1. Blood pressures for patients in group 2 were controlled using the same
      two options, except to levels below 130/70 mmHg. Patients within the two groups
      were selected and controlled with regard to sex, age, and serum creatinine. The
      renal protective effects of each protocol were evaluated in terms of reductions
      in creatinine clearance. After 3 years of the above outlined blood pressure
      control regimens, the reductions in creatinine clearance were compared. RESULTS: 
      Creatinine clearances decreased in group 1 patients (from 85.7 +/- 2.4 ml/min to 
      72.9 +/- 2.4 ml/min, p < 0.05). On the other hand, creatinine clearance remained 
      essentially unchanged for patients in group 2 (from 87.2 +/-4.7 ml/min to 85.9
      +/- 5.9 ml/min). Although creatinine clearance in both groups was almost the same
      at the start of study, there was a significant difference between them by the
      conclusion of the study (p < 0.05). Proteinuria and hematuria did not change
      significantly throughout the study and there were no significant differences in
      these respects between these two corresponding groups. There were no significant 
      differences between the groups with reference to side-effects or complications.
      CONCLUSION: These data provide evidence that reducing blood pressure has
      protective renal effects in cases of mild renal insufficiency with hypertension
      in IgA nephropathy.

TI  - Bisoprolol alone and in combination with amlodipine or nifedipine in the
      treatment of chronic stable angina.
PG  - 360-3
AB  - Beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are both effective monotherapy for stable
      angina. When symptoms persist, these two agents are commonly co-prescribed in the
      hope that this combination has added benefit compared with monotherapy alone. We 
      investigated the additional efficacy of the calcium antagonists amlodipine and
      nifedipine when added to bisoprolol in patients with stable angina. Patients were
      randomised in a multicentre, single-blind study, with crossover of three
      treatments consisting of bisoprolol 10 mg once daily, bisoprolol plus nifedipine 
      20 mg twice daily, and bisoprolol plus amlodipine 5 mg once daily. Exercise tests
      were performed at the end of each four-week study period and the exercise time to
      onset of angina was assessed. A total of 198 patients from 17 centres were
      recruited of whom 147 were evaluable for efficacy. There were no statistically
      significant differences in exercise duration to onset of angina between any of
      the groups. The combination of bisoprolol plus nifedipine was least well
      tolerated. In summary, this study suggests there is little benefit in adding a
      calcium antagonist to bisoprolol in treating patients with stable angina.

TI  - Comparison of efficacy and side effects of combination therapy of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (benazepril) with calcium antagonist
      (either nifedipine or amlodipine) versus high-dose calcium antagonist monotherapy
      for systemic hypertension.
PG  - 1182-7
AB  - The present 2 multicenter studies were designed to evaluate whether patients with
      essential hypertension derived equal benefits from use of combination therapy
      with a calcium antagonist and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as
      from doubling the dose of the calcium antagonist. After a 2-week washout and a
      2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a total of 1,390 patients were treated
      with either nifedipine 30 mg (study 1) or amlodipine 5 mg (study 2) once daily
      for 4 weeks. The 1,079 patients whose diastolic blood pressure remained between
      95 and 115 mm Hg were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind therapy with
      amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/ benazepril 20 mg, nifedipine
      30 mg or nifedipine 60 mg (study 1), and amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg,
      amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, amlodipine 5 mg or amlodipine 10 mg (study 2). 
      Both doses of the calcium antagonist/ACE inhibitor combination therapy lowered
      diastolic pressure as much as the high dose and significantly better than the
      lower dose of calcium antagonist monotherapy (with either nifedipine or
      amlodipine). However, 15% of patients in the nifedipine high-dose monotherapy
      group and 24% in the amlodipine high-dose monotherapy group presented with some
      form of edema. In contrast, the incidence of edema was similar for patients
      treated with both combination therapy and low-dose calcium antagonists. Thus,
      combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and an ACE inhibitor provides blood
      pressure control equal to that of high-dose calcium antagonist monotherapy but
      with significantly fewer dose-dependent adverse experiences such as vasodilatory 
      edema. Inc.

TI  - Effects of isradipine or enalapril on blood pressure in salt-sensitive
      hypertensives during low and high dietary salt intake. MIST II Trial
      Investigators.
PG  - 1180-8
AB  - This large multicenter study, tested the antihypertensive effects of isradipine, 
      a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and enalapril, an
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients 
      under low and high salt intake diets. After a 3-week (weeks -9 to -6) of ad lib
      salt diet, those patients who had a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of > 
      or =95 but < or =115 mm Hg qualified to enter a 3-week (weeks -6 to -3) placebo
      run-in low salt diet (50 to 80 mmol Na+/day). Then high salt (200 to 250 mmol
      Na+/day) was added to the placebo treatment for 3 weeks (weeks -3 to 0). Those
      patients who demonstrated an increase in SDBP > or =5 mm Hg from the low to high 
      salt diet were considered salt sensitive and were randomized into a 4-week (weeks
      0 to 4) double-blind treatment period of either isradipine 2.5 to 10 mg twice a
      day, enalapril 2.5 to 20 mg twice a day, or placebo. Then they entered a 3-week
      (weeks 4 to 7) placebo washout phase of low salt diet (50 to 80 mmol Na+/day).
      After week 7 and while the low salt diet was continued the patients were
      restarted on their double-blind treatment for 4 more weeks (weeks 7 to 11) and
      the study was completed. Of 1,916 patients screened, 464 were randomized into the
      double-blind treatment phase and 397 completed the study. Both isradipine and
      enalapril decreased the sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) and SDBP during
      the high salt diet, to a similar degree, whereas enalapril caused a greater
      reduction in SSBP and SDBP than isradipine during the low salt diet (11.3 +/-
      1.2/7.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg v 7.7 +/- 0.9/4.8 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM,
      respectively, P < .02). Within drugs, the effect of isradipine on blood pressure 
      (BP) was higher during the high than the low salt diet (14.9 +/- 1.5 v 7.6 +/-
      1.3 mm Hg for SSBP and 10.1 +/- 0.6 v 4.8 +/- 0.9 mm Hg for SDBP, P < .001), but 
      enalapril exerted a similar effect during both diets. Because salt restriction
      lowered both SSBP and SDBP, the lowest BP achieved with both drugs were during
      the salt restriction phase.

TI  - Combination therapy with beta-adrenergic blockade and amlodipine as second line
      treatment in essential hypertension.
PG  - 424-8
AB  - In hypertension both beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are drugs with proved 
      efficacy. Because only half the patients respond to a single drug, even at full
      dosage, a second hypotensive agent is frequently required to obtain adequate
      blood pressure control. The combination of a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist
      and a beta-blocker can be justified by their different mechanisms of action. A
      randomised double blind parallel group study versus placebo was performed, in
      order to assess the efficacy of atenolol combined with amlodipine in the
      treatment of stage I-II essential hypertension not controlled by atenolol alone. 
      Twenty-four-hour arterial blood pressure monitoring showed that amlodipine added 
      to atenolol produced a statistically significant reduction of blood pressure
      values compared with placebo in patients whose blood pressure was not controlled 
      by atenolol alone. Blood pressure circadian rhythm was unchanged. The reduction
      of side-effects, obtained by adding a dihydropyridine derivate to a beta-blocker,
      confirms the effectiveness of this combination.

TI  - A randomized prospective crossover trial of amlodipine in pediatric hypertension.
PG  - 1083-7
AB  - Amlodipine has potential advantages in children since it can be dissolved into a 
      liquid preparation and has a long elimination half-life, allowing for once-daily 
      administration. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and
      compliance of amlodipine with that of standard long-acting calcium channel
      blockers (felodipine or nifedipine) in hypertensive children. A randomized,
      prospective, crossover study of 11 hypertensive children (9-17 years of age, 10
      renal transplant patients) was performed with electronic monitoring of
      compliance. Each treatment arm was 30 days. No significant differences were
      observed in mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) between
      amlodipine and the other calcium channel blockers. Using 24-h blood pressure
      monitoring there were no significant differences over each drug treatment period 
      in both mean day-time and night-time SBP and DBP. Patient compliance was similar 
      in both the amlodipine and the nifedipine/felodipine treatment periods. These
      data suggest that amlodipine is as effective in pediatric nephrology patients as 
      nifedipine and felodipine. Amlodipine may be optimally suited for treatment of
      young children because at present it is the only calcium channel blocker which
      can be administered once daily as a liquid preparation.

      combined alpha-beta-blocker (Labetalol) for the control of emergence hypertension
      during craniotomy for tumor surgery.
PG  - 904-9
AB  - We compared the efficacy of the combination of enalaprilat/labetalol with that of
      enalaprilat/nicardipine to prevent emergence postcraniotomy hypertension. A
      prospective, randomized open labeled clinical trial was designed to compare the
      incidence of breakthrough hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] > 140 mm
      Hg) and adverse effects (hypotension, tachycardia, and bradycardia) between the
      two drug combinations. Secondarily, the effects of the drugs on SBP, mean blood
      pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were evaluated over the course of the
      study. Forty-two patients received enalaprilat 1.25 mg IV at dural closure
      followed by either multidose nicardipine 2 mg IV or labetalol 5 mg IV to maintain
      the SBP below 140 mm Hg. SBP was similarly controlled in both groups. There was a
      marginally smaller incidence of failures and adverse effects with labetalol.
      Blood pressure profiles were similar for both groups.

TI  - [Calcium channel blocking agents and albuminuria in diabetic and hypertensive
      patients. A pilot study].
PG  - 919-24
AB  - Diltiazem tends to decrease proteinuria in hypertensive diabetic subjects in
      comparison to amlodipine that does not modify it. Since estimated glomerular
      pressure is identical in amlodipine treated and diltiazem treated subjects,
      differences in albuminuria may be explained by different renal tubular
      reabsorption rates. OBJECTIVES: To compare plasma clearances (PC) of technetium
      labeled albumin (albumin-Tc99m) obtained by serial plasma measurements with PC
      obtained by urinary excretion measurements. Indirectly evaluate tubular
      reabsorption of albumin-Tc99m. Test the hypothesis that amlodipine decreases
      renal tubular reabsorption of albumin in diabetic hypertensive subjects. METHODS:
      Fourteen diabetic and hypertensive subjects (DH) (average plasma creatinine: 94
      mmol/L) and 6 normal subjects (average plasma creatinine: 82 mmol/L) had
      previously been assessed for albumin-Tc99m PC. Eleven of these 14 DH subjects
      were then randomized to diltiazem 300 mg/daily (6 subjects) or amlodipine 10
      mg/daily (5 subjects). Their glomerular filtration, glomerular pressure and
      albumin-Tc99m PC were then assessed on the 3rd, 6th, and 12th month of the study.
      RESULTS: Albumin-Tc99m PC obtained from serial blood draws: A decrease in PC
      between months 0 and 3 from 14 to 10.6 cc/min was observed in subjects treated
      with amlodipine but subjects on diltiazem showed PC stability (from 11.9 to 12
      cm3/min). PC obtained from urinary excretion: Amlodipine and diltiazem treated
      subjects showed PC stability. Plasma volume in amlodipine treated subjects
      decreased from 156 to 127% and diltiazem treated subjects from 128 to 117%.
      CONCLUSION: A decrease in PC obtained with plasma measurements and stability of
      PC based on urinary excretion measurements tends to identify a decrease in plasma
      volume. A decrease in albumin-Tc99m tubular reabsorption was not observed. The
      estimate of albumin PC with Tc 99m labelled albumin measurements still needs to
      be validated.

TI  - Amlodipine is comparable to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for long-term
      renoprotection in hypertensive patients with renal dysfunction: a one-year,
      prospective, randomized study.
PG  - 980-5
AB  - Unlike angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), few long-term studies
      have shown calcium antagonists to retard the progression of renal dysfunction.
      Our aim was to prospectively compare the effects of amlodipine and ACEI
      (enalapril) on renal function in hypertensive patients with renal impairment due 
      to chronic glomerulonephritis and essential hypertension. A total of 72
      hypertensive patients with serum creatinine (Cr) > 1.5 mg/dL were randomly
      allocated to treatment with either drug. During a 1-year period, 33% of the
      patients treated with ACEI dropped out due to adverse events, whereas 9% of
      patients with amlodipine dropped out. Data of 28 patients were available for
      analysis of more than 1-year follow-up. Reductions in blood pressure were
      comparable between the amlodipine (from 165/101 to 138/81 mm Hg) and ACEI groups.
      Serum Cr increased from 2.1+/-0.8 (SD) to 2.6+/-1.0 mg/dL with amlodipine (n =
      16), but the difference was equivalent to that with ACEI (n = 12). Creatinine
      clearance (Ccr) in the moderate dysfunction group (basal Cr, 1.5 to 2.0 mg/dL)
      changed from 36+/-10 to 33+/-11 mL/min (not significant) with amlodipine, and the
      change was similar to that noted with ACEI. Annual declines in Ccr with
      amlodipine (-3.7 mL/min/year) and ACEI (-2.6 mL/min/year) were comparable, and
      both tended to be smaller than the annual decline in glomerular filtration rate
      reported in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (-6 mL/min/year).
      Serum potassium was increased significantly (P < .01), from 4.5+/-0.4 to
      5.3+/-0.8 mEq/L, only in the ACEI group. This 1-year prospective study
      demonstrated the effect of amlodipine on renal function to be likely the same as 
      that of ACEI. Furthermore, amlodipine was better tolerated than ACEI for
      hypertensive patients with renal dysfunction.

TI  - Circadian rhythm and sudden death in heart failure: results from Prospective
      Randomized Amlodipine Survival Trial.
PG  - 541-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to address the timing of sudden death in
      advanced heart failure patients. BACKGROUND: Sudden death is a catastrophic event
      in cardiovascular disease. It has a circadian pattern prominent in the early AM, 
      which has been thought to be due to a surge of sympathetic stimulation. We
      postulated that the distribution of events in advanced heart failure, with
      chronic sympathetic activation, would be more uniform implicating other potential
      mechanisms. METHODS: We analyzed data from Prospective Randomized Amlodipine
      Survival Trial (PRAISE). Sudden deaths were analyzed by time of death in 4-h and 
      1-h blocks for uniformity of distribution in the entire cohort, and in the
      prespecified ischemic and nonischemic stratum. Further analyses were undertaken
      in the treatment groups of amlodipine and placebo, and among those receiving
      background therapy of aspirin and warfarin. RESULTS: Sudden deaths in the overall
      cohort showed a nonuniform distribution with a PM peak but not an AM peak. The
      ischemic stratum also showed a PM peak, but sudden deaths within the nonischemic 
      stratum were uniformly distributed. Neither amlodipine treatment nor aspirin or
      warfarin use altered the distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Sudden death in advanced
      heart failure did not show an AM peak, suggesting that circadian sympathetic
      activation did not strongly influence these events. The PM peak noted is likely
      complex in origin and was not affected by antiischemic or antithrombotic
      medications.

TI  - Silent myocardial ischaemia in the elderly.
PG  - 381-9
AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death and disability in the
      elderly. Several recent studies have shown that silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI)
      is a common manifestation of CAD, especially in the elderly. As many as 40% of
      elderly patients with no prior history of CAD may have underlying asymptomatic
      disease and up to 50% of elderly patients with known CAD might have evidence of
      SMI. The results of studies in elderly patients with CAD have also shown that SMI
      might exist despite antianginal therapy that is considered adequate for symptom
      control. In order to diagnose such residual SMI, the clinician would need to
      perform 24- to 48-hour Holter monitoring in the ambulatory setting while the
      patient is performing routine daily activities. Although a number of
      anti-ischaemic drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of SMI, available data
      suggest that beta-blocker given alone or in combination with a nitrate compound
      or calcium antagonist provides the best therapeutic choice. The long term benefit
      of SMI suppression in elderly patients has not been established. Future studies
      need to evaluate the clinical benefits of therapy given for SMI in the elderly.

TI  - Long-term effects of diltiazem and verapamil on mortality and cardiac events in
      non-Q-wave acute myocardial infarction without pulmonary congestion: post hoc
      subset analysis of the multicenter diltiazem postinfarction trial and the second 
      danish verapamil infarction trial studies.
PG  - 275-9
AB  - The main objective of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the long-term
      effect of the heart rate-lowering calcium antagonists verapamil and diltiazem on 
      the incidence of combined cardiac events and all-cause mortality in patients who 
      had experienced a non-Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but who did not
      also have pulmonary congestion. In addition, factors having an independent
      association with these 2 outcomes were identified. Of 817 non-Q-wave patients, 81
      (9.9%) died during 12 to 52 months of follow-up. The unadjusted mortality rate
      was 42% lower in patients randomized to calcium antagonist therapy than placebo
      (7.2% vs 12.4%, p = 0.010). Non-Q-wave patients who died during follow-up were
      older than patients who survived (62 vs 58 years, p = 0.001). Other factors found
      to have an independent association with all-cause mortality included diuretic use
      (RR 2.79), diabetes mellitus (RR 2.86), and New York Heart Association class >I
      (RR 1.73). The covariate adjusted all-cause mortality risk ratio associated with 
      randomization to calcium antagonist therapy was 0.65 (95% confidence interval
      [0.40 to 1.05, p = 0.079]). Overall, 153 patients (18.7%) died or had nonfatal
      reinfarction. The unadjusted combined event rate was 31% lower in patients
      randomized to calcium antagonist therapy than to placebo (15.2% vs 21.9%, p
      <0.006). Factors found to have an independent association with cardiac events
      included age, diabetes (RR 2.82), diuretic use (RR 2.04), and previous AMI (RR 1.
      71). In addition, randomization to the calcium antagonist group had a significant
      independent association with reduced cardiac events (p = 0.031). The covariate
      adjusted event rate RR associated with randomization to the calcium antagonist
      group was 0.69 (95% confidence interval [0.49 to 0.97]). In conclusion, the heart
      rate-lowering calcium antagonists diltiazem and verapamil may play an important
      role in reducing long-term mortality and reinfarction in non-Q-wave AMI without
      pulmonary congestion.

TI  - Effects of diltiazem retard on ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate
      variability in patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 181-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists increase heart rate due to reflex
      activation of the sympathetic nervous system, although these effects are less
      obvious for long-acting agents. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of diltiazem
      retard, a long-acting nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on 24h blood
      pressure, heart rate and autonomic nerve activity in patients with essential
      hypertension. DESIGN: Randomized crossover design. METHODS: Thirteen patients
      [five men and eight women, aged 64+/-2 years (mean+/-SEM)] were administered
      placebo or diltiazem retard (100-200mg once daily) for 4 weeks each. Ambulatory
      monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate, and electrocardiography were carried
      out at the end of each period using a multibiomedical recorder (TM-2425).
      Autonomic nerve activity was evaluated by power spectral analysis of variability 
      of heart rate using the high-frequency component as an index of parasympathetic
      nerve activity and the ratio of the low-frequency component and the
      high-frequency component as an index of sympathovagal balance. RESULTS: Treatment
      with diltiazem retard significantly decreased 24h average blood pressure and
      heart rate by 11.6+/-3.6/5.7+/-1.8mmHg and 5.0+/-1.1 beats/min, respectively. The
      changes in daytime and night-time values were comparable. Diltiazem retard also
      significantly decreased daytime and 24h low:high-frequency-component ratio
      (2.0+/-0.2 versus 1.7+/-0.2 and 1. 8+/-0.2 versus 1.6+/-0.2, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that diltiazem retard is effective as a
      once-daily antihypertensive agent and has favorable effects on heart rate and the
      autonomic nervous system.

TI  - Use of metoprolol CR/XL to maintain sinus rhythm after conversion from persistent
      atrial fibrillation: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy
      of metoprolol CR/XL to reduce the risk of relapse after cardioversion of
      persistent atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. BACKGROUND: Indirect data from
      studies with d,l sotalol provide evidence that the beta-blocking effects of the
      compound are important in maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial 
      fibrillation. METHODS: After successful conversion to sinus rhythm, 394 patients 
      with a history of persistent atrial fibrillation were randomly assigned to
      treatment with metoprolol CR/XL or placebo. The two treatment groups were similar
      with respect to all pretreatment characteristics. Patients were seen on an
      outpatient basis for recording of resting electrocardiogram (ECG) after one week,
      one, three and six months of follow-up or whenever they felt that they had a
      relapse into atrial fibrillation or experienced an adverse event. RESULTS: In the
      metoprolol CR/XL group, 96 patients (48.7%) had a relapse into atrial
      fibrillation compared with 118 patients (59.9%) in the placebo group (p = 0.005).
      Heart rate in patients after a relapse into atrial fibrillation was significantly
      lower in the metoprolol group (98 +/- 23 beats/min) than in the placebo group
      (107 +/- 27 beats/min). The rate of adverse events reported was similar in both
      groups when the difference in follow-up time was taken into account. CONCLUSIONS:
      The results of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients after
      cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation showed that metoprolol CR/XL was 
      effective in preventing relapse into atrial fibrillation or flutter.

TI  - Maternal and neonatal outcome of preeclamptic pregnancies: the potential roles of
      factor V Leiden mutation and 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase.
PG  - 163-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential perinatal effects of Factor V Leiden
      mutation and 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism in
      preeclamptic women. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty preeclamptic women (N = 120)
      and 101 healthy pregnant controls (N = 101) were recruited and evaluated for
      frequency of Leiden and 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)
      mutations using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Perinatal outcomes were then
      recorded and analyzed for all study participants and their neonates. RESULTS:
      Laboratory analysis yielded 22 (18.33%) heterozygous carriers of Factor V Leiden 
      mutation among preeclamptic women and 3 (2.97%) heterozygous carriers among the
      healthy controls; differences between the two groups were found to be
      statistically significant [p < 0.001, the relative risk (RR) = 6.17, 95%
      confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.90-20.02]. Homozygous MTHFR mutations were found
      in 8 of 120 (6.67%) preeclamptic women and in 6 of the 101 (5.94%) healthy
      controls evaluated. Among preeclamptic women, episodes of hemolysis, elevated
      liver enzymes, and low platelet (HELLP) syndrome were reported in 7 of 22
      (31.81%) of those with Factor V Leiden mutation and in 11 of 98 (11.22%) of those
      who were negative for the mutation. Group differences were determined to be
      statistically significant (p < 0.015, RR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.24-6. 48). Perinatal 
      indicators collected from the two groups included frequency of intrauterine
      growth retardation, birth weight, and gestational age. No statistically different
      perinatal outcomes were found between Factor V Leiden positive and negative
      preeclamptic women. In addition, MTHFR gene polymorphism did not appear to be
      correlated with the development of preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: Although the
      frequency of Factor V Leiden mutation appears to be significantly higher among
      preeclamptic women, the mechanism of pathogenesis and potential influence on
      perinatal outcomes is not yet well understood. Relatively high rates of HELLP
      syndrome among those with Factor V Leiden mutation suggest that this thrombogene 
      mutation may play a significant role in hemostatic system activation. Our results
      suggest that the role of MTHFR polymorphism and other factors such as folic acid 
      supplementation will require more extensive analysis in controlling worldwide
      morbidity and mortality associated with this important maternal condition.

TI  - Clinical trials update: OPTIME-CHF, PRAISE-2, ALL-HAT.
PG  - 209-12
AB  - This is a summary of reports of presentation made at the American College of
      Cardiology 49th Scientific Sessions, Anaheim, 12-15 March 2000. Studies with a
      particular interest for heart failure physicians have been reviewed. OPTIME-CHF: 
      Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of
      Chronic Heart Failure. OPTIME-CHF was a randomised-controlled trial comparing a
      48-h infusion of Milrinone or standard therapy in 951 patients recruited over a
      2-year period. Patients were excluded if the investigator believed their clinical
      condition mandated inotropic therapy. Patients were randomised within 48 h of
      admission for an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure to receive Milrinone
      or placebo infision for 48 h. Of the patients 43% were diabetics, 70% were
      receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, 25% were already on a
      beta-Blocker, and 34% had atrial fibrillation. There was no significant
      difference between the two groups in length of hospital stay during the index
      admission, subsequent readmissions and days in hospital over the following 60
      days. Subjective clinical assessment scores were also no different. There was an 
      average admission rate over the next year of one per patient in both groups.
      However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of sustained
      hypotension in the Milrinone group, which accounted for all of the increased
      adverse event rates for the active therapy. The 60-day mortality was 10% in both 
      groups. This and previous trials of the oral formulation of Milrinone have now
      clearly demonstrated a lack of benefit with Milrinone in either during acute
      exacerbations of or in stable severe chronic heart failure [Packer M, Carver JR, 
      Rodeheffer RJ et al. Effect of oral Milrinone on mortality in severe chronic
      heart failure. N Engl J Med 1991;325:1468-1475.]. Medium sized studies of
      Milrinone in patients with milder severities of heart failure also suggested an
      adverse impact on prognosis in the presence or absence of digoxin [DiBianco R,
      Shabetai R, Kostuk W, Moran J, Schlant RC, Wright R. A comparison of oral
      Milrinone, digoxin, and their combination in the treatment of patients with
      chronic heart failure. N Engl J Med 1989;320:677-683.]. Whether Milrinone even
      has a role for the management of a haemodyamic crisis requiring inotropic therapy
      must also be questioned.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of a new antihypertensive
      drug combination of trandolapril/verapamil compared to monotherapy with verapamil
      or trandolapril, in patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension. DESIGN: 
      A multicentre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled cross-over study
      with specific statistical considerations. SETTINGS: Eighteen primary health care 
      centres and out-patient hospital clinics in Sweden. PATIENTS: Two hundred and
      twenty-six outpatients with uncomplicated primary hypertension with a baseline
      sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) between 95 and 115 mmHg. INTERVENTIONS:
      After a 4-week placebo period, patients were randomized to treatment for 8 weeks 
      with trandolapril/verapamil (2 mg/180 mg) or each drug alone (verapamil 240 mg,
      trandolapril 2 mg) for 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment responses (blood
      pressure (BP) fall and rate pressure product) to the three regimens with
      statistical comparison and also in relation to plasma concentrations of active
      renin (AR). Adverse events and safety were also evaluated. RESULTS: The mean BP
      fall was significantly greater with the combination (20/15 mmHg), p < 0.00054, as
      compared to both trandolapril (14/11 mmHg) or verapamil (13/11) mmHg. The
      difference between verapamil and trandolapril was not significant. Rate pressure 
      product decreased significantly more on the combination, p < 0.001, than on
      trandolapril or verapamil alone. Treatment response to trandolapril was
      positively correlated to initial AR (r = 0.30-0.43). All treatments were well
      tolerated and safe. CONCLUSIONS: The new fixed drug combination
      trandolapril/verapamil was superior to monotherapy with either of these drugs
      alone regarding reduction of both BP and rate pressure product. This combination 
      can be safely and effectively used for the treatment of mild to moderate primary 
      hypertension.

TI  - Effects of enalapril and isradipine alone and in combination on blood pressure,
      renal function and echocardiographic parameters in mild hypertension.
PG  - 77-84
AB  - AIMS AND METHODS: A study was carried out to evaluate the influence of
      antihypertensive treatment with combined low doses of enalapril plus isradipine
      (5+5 mg daily) compared with those of either drug at a higher dose level (10 mg
      daily) by double-blind, three-way crossover study (balanced Latin square design) 
      in 102 subjects (mean age 51.9 +/- 7.42 years) with essential hypertension. Left 
      ventricular mass and function were evaluated by M-B mode echocardiography, renal 
      function by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and by serum and 24-h urinary Na+
      and K+ during wash-out period and after 24 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: The
      supine blood pressure for subjects given placebo was 171/103 mmHg. After 24 weeks
      of treatment, systolic and diastolic supine blood pressure were significantly
      lower with 5 mg isradipine plus 5 mg enalapril (134/84 mmHg) than with 10 mg
      enalapril (137/84 mmHg) or with 10 mg isradipine (144/85 mmHg). Left ventricular 
      posterior wall and septal thickness were significantly and similarly reduced in
      all groups. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic end diameters were not
      significantly changed. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was significantly reduced in E
      plus I group and enalapril group. GFR was not significantly altered. The 24-h
      urinary Na+ significantly increased with enalapril, more so than isradipine. The 
      combination was tolerated better than either monotherapy. We observed no
      clinically significant changes in laboratory variables including blood
      lipoproteins. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of isradipine plus enalapril reduced
      blood pressure more effectively and was better tolerated than other drug alone.
      All three groups showed similar changes in echocardiographic indices and no
      change in renal function.

TI  - Prospective randomized comparison of antiarrhythmic therapy versus first-line
      radiofrequency ablation in patients with atrial flutter.
PG  - 1898-904
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the high success rate of radiofrequency (RF) ablation,
      pharmacologic therapy is still considered the standard initial therapeutic
      approach for atrial flutter. OBJECTIVE: We prospectively compared the outcome at 
      follow-up of patients with atrial flutter randomly assigned to drug therapy or RF
      ablation. METHODS: Patients with at least two episodes of symptomatic atrial
      flutter in the last four months were randomized to regimens of either
      antiarrhythmic drug therapy or first-line RF ablation. After institution of
      therapy, end points included recurrence of atrial flutter, rehospitalization and 
      quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients entered the study, 30 of whom
      were randomized to drug therapy and 31 to RF ablation. After a mean follow-up of 
      21 +/- 11 months, 11 of 30 (36%) patients receiving drugs were in sinus rhythm,
      versus 25 of 31 (80%) patients who underwent RF ablation (p < 0.01). Of the
      patients receiving drugs, 63% required one or more rehospitalizations, whereas
      post-RF ablation, only 22% of patients were rehospitalized (p < 0.01). Following 
      RF ablation, 29% of patients developed atrial fibrillation which was seen in 53% 
      of patients receiving medications (p < 0.05). Sense of well being (pre-RF 2.0 +/-
      0.3 vs. post-RF 3.8 +/- 0.5, p < 0.01) and function in daily life (pre-RF 2.3 +/-
      0.4 vs. post-RF 3.6 +/- 0.6, p < 0.01) improved after ablation, but did not
      change significantly in patients treated with drugs. CONCLUSION: In a selected
      group of patients with atrial flutter, RF ablation could be considered a
      first-line therapy due to the better success rate and impact on quality of life, 
      the lower occurrence of atrial fibrillation and the lower need for
      rehospitalization at follow-up.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine on hemodynamic and endocrine responses to mental stress.
PG  - 518-22
AB  - Little is known about the effects of antihypertensive drugs on hemodynamic
      responses to mental stress. We studied 24 patients with mild-to-moderate
      hypertension in a double-blind random-sequence crossover study comparing placebo 
      with amlodipine titrated up from 5 to 10 mg daily. After 1 month of treatment,
      the subjects performed 20 min of a frustrating cognitive task. At baseline before
      task, amlodipine significantly reduced systolic pressure (128.9+/-8.2 mm Hg v
      140.3+/-10.7 mm Hg, P < .001), diastolic pressure (81.7+/-7.7 mm Hg v 90+/-7.5 mm
      Hg, P < .001), and total peripheral resistance (37.5+/-15 v 45.6+/-23.7 mm
      Hg/L/min, P < .05), while elevating baseline norepinephrine levels (2286+/-731
      pmol/L v 1788+/-546 pmol/L, P < .001). Blood pressure during the stress task was 
      significantly less with amlodipine than with placebo (systolic 142.3+/-12.3 mm Hg
      v 150.9+/-14.6 mm Hg, P < .001; diastolic 87.9+/-8.4 mm Hg v 97.7+/-9.3 mm Hg, P 
      < .001), whereas norepinephrine was significantly higher (2754+/-1007 pmol/L v
      1970+/-740 pmol/L, P < .001). There were no significant differences in cardiac
      output, plasma lipids or lipoproteins, or markers of platelet activation. Heart
      rate increased significantly during stress, but there was no significant
      difference between amlodipine and placebo either at baseline or during stress.
      Our conclusion is that amlodipine reduces blood pressure at baseline and during
      mental stress, but raises basal and stress-related plasma catecholamines. This
      finding may have implications for the recent controversy over the safety of
      calcium channel antagonists, and suggests the potential relevance of combining
      amlodipine with adrenergic blockers.

TI  - Influence of diabetes and type of hypertension on response to antihypertensive
      treatment.
PG  - 1038-42
AB  - The aim of our investigation was to determine whether the presence of additional 
      risk factors or type of hypertension (diastolic or isolated systolic) influences 
      blood pressure (BP) response to treatment. The International Nifedipine GITS
      Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) study is a
      double-blinded outcome comparison of calcium channel blockade with diuretics in
      high-risk patients aged 55 to 80 years. Dynamic randomization between nifedipine 
      once daily and hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride was performed to ensure that
      approximately equal numbers of patients in the 2 groups had each of the major
      cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with isolated systolic hypertension were
      also separately randomized. Atenolol or enalapril was the mandatory second-line
      drug. In 5669 patients who completed the 18-week titration, BP fell from
      172+/-15/99+/-9 mm Hg (mean+/-SD) while receiving placebo to 139+/-12/82+/-7 mm
      Hg. Twenty-six percent of patients required 2 drugs, and 4% required 3 drugs.
      Patients with diabetes were the most resistant to treatment, requiring second and
      third drugs 40% and 100% more frequently than patients without diabetes and
      achieving marginally the highest final BP, for any risk group, of 141+/-13/82+/-8
      mm Hg. Age, smoking, gender, hypercholesterolemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, 
      and existing atherosclerosis had little (<1 mm Hg) or no influence on BP at the
      end of titration, but all except smoking slightly reduced the initial response of
      either systolic or diastolic BP. Patients with isolated systolic hypertension
      were slightly more responsive than average to treatment. Our findings suggest
      that in patients at high absolute risk of cardiovascular complications from
      hypertension, the risk factors themselves do not prevent the recommended BP
      targets from being achieved.

TI  - Comparison of atenolol, amlodipine, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and losartan 
      for antihypertensive treatment in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
PG  - 1423-8
AB  - We compared the effects of atenolol (50 mg), amlodipine (5 mg), enalapril (20
      mg), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg), and losartan (50 mg) given in once-daily oral
      doses on office and ambulatory blood pressures (BPs) in patients with
      hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Each of 40 randomized patients
      was treated in sequence with two of the five agents (balanced incomplete block
      design). Treatment periods lasted 6 wk and were separated by a 3-wk washout
      period. Changes in BP from baseline with the study substances were compared
      through analysis of variance. Office diastolic BP, our primary outcome variable, 
      was most effectively lowered by atenolol, with all four post hoc differences
      between atenolol and the remaining substances being statistically significant.
      Reductions in office systolic and daytime ambulatory BP were not significantly
      different among the five compounds. However, atenolol reduced mean nighttime
      ambulatory diastolic and systolic BP more effectively than did amlodipine,
      enalapril, or losartan (but not hydrochlorothiazide). Severity of
      sleep-disordered breathing and well-being during the day were not significantly
      influenced by any of the study compounds. Our findings are in accordance with the
      hypothesis that an overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is an important
      mechanism behind the development or maintenance of hypertension in patients with 
      OSA.

      placebo to prevent cardiovascular complications in elderly hypertensive patients 
      in the first STOP-Hypertension study in 1991, a Swedish group published at the
      end of 1999 the STOP-2 Hypertension study. The latter randomised trial showed in 
      a similar population that the cardiovascular protection of more recent
      antihypertensive agents such as calcium antagonists and
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors is similar to that of the conventional
      antihypertensive drugs used in the first study. In fact, the degree of blood
      pressure control appears to be more important than the type of antihypertensive
      drugs used, and this conclusion is reinforced by the observation that numerous
      patients should rapidly be treated by more than one antihypertensive agent to
      reach blood pressure targets.

TI  - Cardiovascular effects of melatonin in hypertensive patients well controlled by
      nifedipine: a 24-hour study.
PG  - 423-7
AB  - AIMS: As melatonin has been found to play a role in the mechanisms of
      cardiovascular regulation, we designed the present study to evaluate whether the 
      evening ingestion of the pineal hormone might interfere with the antihypertensive
      therapy in hypertensive patients well-controlled by nifedipine monotherapy.
      METHODS: Forty-seven mild to moderate essential hypertensive outpatients taking
      nifedipine GITS 30 or 60 mg monotherapy at 08.30 h for at least 3 months, were
      given placebo or melatonin 5 mg at 22.30 h for 4 weeks according to a
      double-blind cross-over study. At the end of each treatment period patients
      underwent a 24 h noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) during
      usual working days; sleeping period was scheduled to last from 23.00 to 07.00 h. 
      RESULTS: The evening administration of melatonin induced an increase of blood
      pressure and heart rate throughout the 24 h period (DeltaSBP = + 6.5 mmHg, P <
      0.001; DeltaDBP = + 4.9 mmHg, P < 0.01; DeltaHR = + 3.9 beats min-1, P < 0.01).
      The DBP as well as the HR increase were particularly evident during the morning
      and the afternoon hours. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that competition between
      melatonin and nifedipine, is able to impair the antihypertensive efficacy of the 
      calcium channel blocker. This suggests caution in uncontrolled use of melatonin
      in hypertensive patients. As the pineal hormone might interfere with calcium
      channel blocker therapy, it cannot be considered simply a dietary supplement.

TI  - Comparison of efficacy of intravenous diltiazem and esmolol in terminating
      supraventricular tachycardia.
PG  - 969-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) can be effectively
      terminated by the intravenous administration of adenosine or verapamil. However
      adenosine is expensive and injectable verapamil currently is scarcely available. 
      While intravenous diltiazem has been shown to be useful for terminating PSVT, the
      efficacy of esmolol in this regard has not been evaluated previously. Hence these
      latter two drugs were studied for their efficacy in terminating PSVT. METHODS: A 
      prospective, randomised, crossover study was undertaken in patients presenting
      with hemodynamically tolerated PSVT to the ICCU. While 50 patients had been
      planned for the trial, the study had to be prematurely terminated after 32
      patients had been enrolled due to the marked superiority of diltiazem. Two
      sequential doses with a 5 minute interval of either drug were administered before
      crossover. Diltiazem was given in a dose of 0.25 mg/kg while the esmolol dose was
      0.5 mg/kg. RESULTS: Diltiazem terminated PSVT in all the 16 patients in whom it
      was given as the first drug. The 12 patients who did not respond to esmolol were 
      also effectively treated with diltiazem. Thus totally 28/28 patients responded to
      diltiazem while only 4/16 patients responded to esmolol (p < 0.001). Of the 28
      patients who responded to diltiazem, in 13 patients the second bolus of diltiazem
      worked after the first one had failed. No significant adverse effects were seen. 
      CONCLUSION: Intravenous diltiazem is highly effective and safe for terminating
      PSVT. When the first bolus is ineffective, the second bolus given after 5 minutes
      usually succeeds. Esmolol in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg has poor efficacy for
      terminating PSVT, even when 2 boluses are administered.

TI  - Regional and racial differences in response to antihypertensive medication use in
      a randomized controlled trial of men with hypertension in the United States.
      Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive
      Agents.
PG  - 825-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke incidence and mortality rates are higher in the southeastern
      region of the United States, which is called the "Stroke Belt." We compared the
      response to antihypertensive medication use in patients from different US
      regions. METHODS: The short-term and 1-year efficacy of the antihypertensive
      medications hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, diltiazem hydrochloride (sustained
      release), captopril, prazosin hydrochloride, and clonidine was compared by US
      region in a randomized controlled trial of 1,105 men with hypertension from 15 US
      Veterans Affairs medical centers. RESULTS: Compared with patients outside the
      Stroke Belt, patients inside the Stroke Belt achieved significantly lower
      treatment success rates of diastolic blood pressure control at 1 year with
      hydrochlorothiazide (63% vs 41%), atenolol (62% vs 46%), captopril (60% vs 30%), 
      and clonidine (69% vs 43%); there were no differences in treatment success rates 
      with diltiazem (70% vs 71%) or prazosin (54% vs 53%). When controlling for race, 
      patients inside the Stroke Belt had significantly lower treatment success rates
      with hydrochlorothiazide (P = .003) and clonidine (P = .003), and the lower
      success rate with atenolol approached significance (P = .15). Regardless of
      region, blacks were less likely than whites to achieve treatment success with
      atenolol (P = .02) or prazosin (P = .03) and more likely with diltiazem (P =
      .05). There was a trend for blacks residing inside the Stroke Belt to have a
      lower treatment success rate than other race-region groups when treated with
      captopril (P = .07). Many regional and racial differences in diet, lifestyle, and
      other characteristics were observed. After adjustment for these characteristics
      by regression analysis, the effect of residing inside the Stroke Belt remained
      for captopril (P = .01) and clonidine (P = .01) and approached significance for
      hydrochlorothiazide (P = .10). CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension in patients residing
      inside the Stroke Belt responded less to the use of several antihypertensive
      medications and important differences were shown in a number of characteristics
      that may affect the control of blood pressure, compared with patients residing
      outside the Stroke Belt.

TI  - Alpha-1-antitrypsin phenotypes in patients with renal arterial fibromuscular
      dysplasia.
PG  - 91-4
AB  - Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a significant cause of renal artery stenosis,
      especially in young females. A rare association between FMD and alpha
      1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) deficiency has been reported. We compared the alpha
      1-AT phenotype distribution in 83 patients with renal arterial FMD with those
      published for Australian populations. alpha 1-AT phenotyping was performed by
      isoelectric focusing between pH 4.2 and pH 4.9 on polyacrylamide gels with
      PiM1M2, PiFM (non-deficiency alleles), PiMS and PiMZ (deficiency alleles)
      markers. Following phenotyping, alpha 1-AT genotyping was performed in 10
      patients to confirm the presence of S and/or Z alleles. The phenotype
      distribution and allele frequencies were similar to those reported for normal
      subjects from two Australian populations (72 (86.7%) PiMM phenotype, one (1.2%)
      PiFM, seven (8.4%) PiMS, two (2.4%) PiMZ and one (1.2%) PiSZ), suggesting that
      alpha 1-AT deficiency is not a common aetiological factor in renal arterial FMD. 
      However, despite FMD being three times less common in males than females, and
      carotid artery dissection being a rare occurrence, a male with PiMS deficiency
      phenotype presented with internal carotid artery dissection and had bilateral
      renal artery FMD. Further, a patient with PiSZ deficiency phenotype was one of
      two sisters with FMD and was more severely affected than her PiMM normal
      phenotype sibling. These two patients from the present series together with nine 
      culled from the literature with alpha 1-AT deficiency phenotype and FMD suggest
      that the chance combination of alpha 1-AT deficiency and FMD may predispose to
      severe manifestations of FMD.

AB  - In the HOT-study 18,790 patients in 26 countries (age 50-80 years, mean age 61.5 
      years) with hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 115 mm
      Hg--mean value 105 mm Hg) were randomised into 3 groups with different target
      blood pressures (90 mm Hg, 85 mm Hg, 80 mm Hg). The basic treatment was with
      Felodipin (5 mg q. d.): if the target pressure was not achieved, further steps
      were initiated: either ACE-inhibitors or -blockers were added, in a third step
      the Felodipindose was increased to 100 mg and in a further step the doses of
      ACE-inhibitors or -blockers were doubled. If target pressure was still not
      achieved, a diuretic was added. Furthermore half of the patients in all groups
      received either placebo or 75 mg acetyl-salicylic acid. To prevent cardiovascular
      events the best benefit was shown, when a diastolic pressure of 82.6 mm Hg was
      reached. Acetyl-salicylic acid showed a further benefit in preventing myocardial 
      infarction, but not in preventing strokes.

TI  - Blood pressure biofeedback treatment of white-coat hypertension.
PG  - 161-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare blood pressure (BP)
      biofeedback treatment (BF) effects between white-coat hypertension and essential 
      hypertension. METHODS: Fifteen white-coat hypertensive out-patients and 23
      essential hypertensive out-patients were randomly assigned to groups A or B.
      Subjects in group A underwent BF once a week for a total of four sessions. Those 
      in group B visited the clinic only to measure BP and later underwent the same BF.
      RESULTS: In group A, BPs of white-coat hypertensives and essential hypertensives 
      were significantly reduced by 22/11 and 14/8 mmHg, respectively. In group B, they
      were unchanged during the same period but later suppressed by BF. Under BF, pulse
      and respiratory rates were significantly higher, and elevation of diastolic BP
      due to mental stress testing was better suppressed in white-coat hypertensives
      than in essential hypertensives. CONCLUSION: This treatment was effective in both
      types of hypertension, and pressor response to stress seems to be important in
      the differentiated BF effect.

      nifedipine-nifedipine retard 10 mg twice daily and nifedipine GITS 20 mg once
      daily--in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.
PG  - 339-43
AB  - A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, cross-over comparison of nifedipine GITS
      20 mg once daily and nifedipine retard 10 mg twice daily in 49 patients with mild
      to moderate hypertension was conducted. Both treatments resulted in clinically
      significant trough blood pressure reductions (nifedipine GITS -10.1/-8.9 mmHg,
      nifedipine retard -7.5/-8.2 mmHg). The study demonstrated that nifedipine GITS
      was 'at least equivalent' to nifedipine retard in the reduction of trough
      diastolic blood pressure (one-sided lower 95% confidence limit, -1.2 mmHg). The
      overall incidence of adverse events (nifedipine GITS 25.5%, nifedipine retard
      34.0%), as well as the incidences of headache (nifedipine GITS 8.5%, nifedipine
      retard 12.8%) and peripheral oedema (nifedipine GITS 2.1%, nifedipine retard
      8.5%), was higher with nifedipine retard compared to nifedipine GITS. Nifedipine 
      GITS 20 mg once daily is 'at least equivalent' to nifedipine retard 10 mg twice
      daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, as well as being better
      tolerated.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers in heart failure: focus on recent
      trials with second-generation dihydropyridines.
PG  - 185-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) has high morbidity and mortality rates
      despite treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and
      digoxin. Adjunctive vasodilation through calcium channel blockade has been
      suggested as potentially useful. However, the first-generation calcium channel
      blockers, including the dihydropyridine nifedipine, showed disappointing results 
      in CHF. The second-generation dihydropyridines were expected to be of more value,
      and of all the calcium channel blockers, these drugs were the ones most studied
      in patients with CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Medline databank was used to
      search studies in human beings (published in 1990 or later) that used
      dihydropyridines in patients with CHF. The references of the studies found were
      subsequently checked for additional data. In 17 studies and more than 2000
      patients with CHF, no consistent beneficial effect was observed with regard to
      exercise tolerance and functional capacity, whereas plasma neurohormones were not
      affected. On the other hand, in general, no worsening of CHF was seen with these 
      second-generation dihydropyridines. Two larger studies (PRAISE and V-HeFT III)
      have given some estimates on the long-term effects of dihydropyridines, and no
      overall influence on mortality rate was found. Of note, subanalysis of the PRAISE
      study has suggested that in patients with a nonischemic cause of CHF, amlodipine 
      might have a beneficial effect on survival. CONCLUSIONS: In this review we have
      focused on the efficacy and safety of dihydropyridines in patients with CHF, as
      reported in recent trials. The data do not support the use of dihydropyridines
      when primarily given as treatment for CHF. The results, however, suggest that
      these drugs can be safely given to patients with left ventricular dysfunction or 
      CHF who need additional treatment for angina pectoris or hypertension.

      hypertension].
PG  - 1945-50
AB  - In a prospective open multicentric study two groups (A and B) of patients with
      essential hypertension used different methods for blood pressure measurements
      under treatment with the calcium channel blocker nifidipine GITS 30 and 60 mg.
      Fifty-one patients were followed for 6 weeks. Results of 24 hour blood pressure
      monitoring at visits after 2, 4 and 6 weeks were only known to physicians of
      group A. In this group the patients took their blood pressure twice per day.
      RESULTS: Both methods for measurement showed an overall decrease of blood
      pressure in the course of therapy. The mean values at the medical visits were
      always higher than the average measurements by 24 hour monitoring or the self
      assessment of blood pressure. The latter two blood pressure values tended to
      agree favorably. The differences between measurements during medical visits and
      measurements taken at home or during normal activity show that measurements in
      the doctor's office may lead to overestimation of hypertension. Without the
      results from blood pressure monitoring 4 (22%) of the patients in group B were
      treated without reason. Nifedipine GITS was well tolerated. Nine patients (16%)
      had undesired drug effects leading to a premature halt of treatment in 3 of them.

      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with
      Hypertension-2 study.
PG  - 1751-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of new antihypertensive drugs has been questioned. We
      compared the effects of conventional and newer antihypertensive drugs on
      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in elderly patients. METHODS: We did a
      prospective, randomised trial in 6614 patients aged 70-84 years with hypertension
      (blood pressure > or = 180 mm Hg systolic, > or = 105 mm Hg diastolic, or both). 
      Patients were randomly assigned conventional antihypertensive drugs (atenolol 50 
      mg, metoprolol 100 mg, pindolol 5 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus amiloride
      2.5 mg daily) or newer drugs (enalapril 10 mg or lisinopril 10 mg, or felodipine 
      2.5 mg or isradipine 2-5 mg daily). We assessed fatal stroke, fatal myocardial
      infarction, and other fatal cardiovascular disease. Analysis was by intention to 
      treat. FINDINGS: Blood pressure was decreased similarly in all treatment groups. 
      The primary combined endpoint of fatal stroke, fatal myocardial infarction, and
      other fatal cardiovascular disease occurred in 221 of 2213 patients in the
      conventional drugs group (19.8 events per 1000 patient-years) and in 438 of 4401 
      in the newer drugs group (19.8 per 1000; relative risk 0.99 [95% CI 0.84-1.16],
      p=0.89). The combined endpoint of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal
      myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular mortality occurred in 460
      patients taking conventional drugs and in 887 taking newer drugs (0.96
      [0.86-1.08], p=0.49). INTERPRETATION: Old and new antihypertensive drugs were
      similar in prevention of cardiovascular mortality or major events. Decrease in
      blood pressure was of major importance for the prevention of cardiovascular
      events.

      relations to ischemia on exercise in chronic stable angina pectoris (the Angina
      Prognosis Study in Stockholm [APSIS]).
PG  - 1151-7
AB  - The prognostic significance of ambulatory ischemia, alone and in relation to
      ischemia during exercise was assessed in 686 patients (475 men) with chronic
      stable angina pectoris taking part in the Angina Prognosis Study In Stockholm
      (APSIS), who had 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic registrations and
      exercise tests at baseline (n = 678) and after 1 month (n = 607) of double-blind 
      treatment with metoprolol or verapamil. Ambulatory electrocardiograms were
      analyzed for ventricular premature complexes and ST-segment depression. During a 
      median follow-up of 40 months, 29 patients died of cardiovascular (CV) causes, 27
      had a nonfatal myocardial infarction, and 89 underwent revascularization.
      Patients with CV death had more episodes (median 5 vs. 1; p<0.01) and longer
      median duration (24 vs. 3 minutes; p<0.01) of ST-segment depression than patients
      without events. For those who had undergone revascularization, the duration was
      also longer (12 vs. 3 minutes; p<0.05). In a multivariate Cox model including
      sex, history of previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, and diabetes, the
      duration of ST-segment depression independently predicted CV death. When exercise
      testing was included, ambulatory ischemia carried additional prognostic
      information only among patients with ST-segment depression > or =2 mm during
      exercise. When the treatment given and treatment effects on ambulatory ischemia
      were added to the Cox model, no significant impact on prognosis was found.
      Ventricular premature complexes carried no prognostic information. Thus, in
      patients with stable angina pectoris, ischemia during ambulatory monitoring
      showed independent prognostic importance regarding CV death. Ambulatory
      electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise testing provide complementary
      information, but only among patients with marked ischemia during exercise.
      Treatment reduced ambulatory ischemia, but the short-term treatment effects did
      not significantly influence prognosis.

TI  - Comparisons of the effects of different long-acting delivery systems on the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diltiazem.
PG  - 1030-7
AB  - The benzothiazepine calcium channel antagonist diltiazem is a short-acting drug. 
      To achieve effective 24-h blood pressure control with once-daily dosing, it
      relies on various extended drug-delivery systems that have grown in importance as
      a result of the recent reports relating the use of short-acting calcium channel
      antagonists to increased cardiovascular morbidity. This study examines the
      pharmacokinetics and resulting pharmacodynamics of two different delivery
      systems, each loaded with 240 mg of diltiazem and administered to 40 moderately
      hypertensive patients in a randomized, double-blind crossover trial. After a
      4-week, single-blind placebo lead-in, patients with a clinical diastolic blood
      pressure of > or =100 mm Hg were randomized to either the single or dual
      microbead diltiazem delivery system for a 4-week period. At the end of this
      period, each subject was evaluated with 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      and subjected to 24-h inpatient pharmacokinetic analysis on separate days. This
      was followed by a similar 4-week period in which each subject was treated with
      the alternative delivery system. For diltiazem, the area under the curve for
      plasma concentration versus time and the maximum plasma concentration attained by
      the single microbead system exceeded the values achieved by the dual bead system 
      by 15% and 25%, respectively. These differences were greatest from the 3rd
      through the 13th h after dosing. During this period, both systolic and diastolic 
      ambulatory blood pressure was significantly lower when the single microbead
      system was used. When compared with baseline blood pressure, blood pressure
      reductions achieved with the single microbead system exceeded reductions achieved
      with the dual microbead system by at least 2 mm Hg for 10 of the 24 postdose
      hours. Heart rates were slightly reduced but not significantly different. This
      improved blood pressure control at higher plasma levels of diltiazem suggests
      that a more efficient delivery system could provide better blood pressure control
      for identical doses of diltiazem.

TI  - How to use calcium antagonists in hypertension: putting the JNC-VI guidelines
      into practice. Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation
      and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.
PG  - 579-87
AB  - The prevention and treatment of hypertension remain as major challenges for
      clinicians all over the world. The recently published Sixth Report of the Joint
      National Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of
      High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) uses evidence-based medicine in providing guidelines
      to aid clinicians in the prevention, detection and treatment of high blood
      pressure, including pharmacological approaches. Calcium antagonists are used
      widely for the treatment of hypertension, and JNC-VI focuses on specific
      situations where calcium antagonists could be considered as preferred treatments.
      There are a large number of calcium antagonists available, with a variety of
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic actions. Several sustained-release
      formulations of these drugs are also available. In terms of blood pressure
      control, calcium antagonists are more effective as antihypertensive treatments
      than beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in Black 
      patients. The dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have been shown to reduce
      morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. 
      The rate-lowering calcium antagonists can be used as alternatives to
      beta-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. Calcium 
      antagonists can be used as alternatives to ACE inhibitors in patients with
      hypertension and concomitant diabetes mellitus and/or renal disease. Some
      dihydropyridine calcium antagonists may be useful as alternatives to ACE
      inhibitors in patients with hypertension and systolic heart failure. Calcium
      antagonists appear to be extremely useful in patients with cyclosporin-induced
      hypertension, and in patients with hypertension and concomitant Raynaud's
      phenomenon and/or migraine. The rate-lowering agents can be used in patients with
      atrial tachyarrhythmias and hypertension. Clinicians should be aware of drug-drug
      interactions involving calcium antagonists, especially after the recent problems 
      with mibefradil. Although retrospective studies have caused controversy regarding
      the safety of calcium antagonists in patients with hypertension, recent
      prospective studies have revealed no major safety concerns with these drugs.

TI  - Sex difference in response of blood pressure to calcium antagonism in the
      treatment of moderate-to-severe hypertension.
PG  - 209-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pressor response to examination in the clinic setting is called
      the 'white coat effect' (WCE). This response may be a confounder when
      investigators use clinic blood pressure as a measure of response to
      antihypertensive therapy. OBJECTIVE: ;To study the effect of the pressor response
      by evaluating the sex-specific effect of treatment with calcium antagonism on
      blood pressure measured in the clinic and by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      (ABPM). METHODS: Untreated hypertensive subjects (n=39) with seated clinic
      diastolic blood pressures (DBP) > or = 100 and < or = 130mmHg were studied.
      Same-day clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) and ambulatory SBP were obtained
      after 1 week of placebo, and after 1 month of treatment with either nifedipine or
      verapamil in a randomized, blinded, parallel trial. RESULTS: With placebo, women 
      s average SBP was 18+/-;4mmHg lower than clinic SBP. By contrast, men s average
      SBP with placebo was 4+/-15mmHg lower than clinic SBP. There was a significantly 
      greater reduction in clinic SBP for women than there was for men after 1 month of
      treatment (by 33+/-13 versus 18+/-18mmHg, P<0.005). However, reduction in
      ambulatory SBP after 1 month was the same for both sexes (20+/-11 versus
      19+/-12mmHg). CONCLUSIONS: In this study of moderate-to-severe hypertensives, the
      large WCE measured for women, which markedly diminished with treatment, accounts 
      for the observed sex difference in response of clinic SBP to calcium antagonism. 
      By contrast, with ABPM there was an equivalent response to treatment for both
      sexes. Use of ABPM could be a valuable means of eliminating the WCE as a
      confounder in clinical research.

TI  - Amlodipine lowers blood pressure without affecting cerebral blood flow as
      measured by single photon emission computed tomography in elderly hypertensive
      subjects.
PG  - 451-7
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effect of amlodipine on blood pressure and cerebral blood
      flow in elderly subjects with mild to moderate hypertension. METHODS: A
      double-blind, parallel group study of 26 patients. After a 4-week placebo run-in 
      period, amlodipine (5-10 mg) or matching placebo was given once daily for 8
      weeks. RESULTS: Amlodipine significantly reduced blood pressure compared with
      baseline. Diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by amlodipine
      compared with placebo (P< 0.02 to P< 0.01). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 
      showed that blood pressure control was sustained over the 24-h dosing interval.
      Relative regional cerebral blood flow, assessed using single photon emission
      computed tomography, was not significantly affected by amlodipine. Three placebo 
      patients, but no amlodipine patients, withdrew because of adverse events.
      CONCLUSION: Amlodipine was a well-tolerated and effective antihypertensive agent,
      and did not reduce regional cerebral blood flow in elderly hypertensive patients.

TI  - Effectiveness of nifedipine GITS in combination with atenolol in chronic stable
      angina.
PG  - 1103-9
AB  - Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) is a once-daily formulation
      of nifedipine that provides stable plasma concentrations over the entire 24 h
      dosing interval. Two-hundred and one patients with Canadian Cardiovascular
      Society class II to III angina who were on 50 mg of atenolol yet still
      experiencing angina symptoms were randomized to receive either placebo or
      nifedipine GITS 30, 60 or 90 mg/day. After four weeks of treatment, the changes
      in time from baseline to onset of 1 mm ST segment depression in the 183 eligible 
      patients were 26.7+/-10.2 s, 40.9+/-11.3 s, 63.2+/-12.9 s and 70.3+/-12.6 for the
      placebo, and 30, 60 and 90 mg/day groups, respectively. These differences were
      significant (P<0.05) for the 60 and 90 mg/day groups compared with placebo and
      for the 60 mg/day group compared with the 30 mg/day group. The times to onset of 
      pain and termination of exercise showed similar prolongation but did not achieve 
      statistical significance. During the one-year open label phase of the study,
      patients exhibited statistically significant improvements in the time to onset of
      ST segment depression, time to anginal pain and time to termination of exercise
      at a mean dose of 52.3 mg/day of nifedipine GITS. Adverse events were primarily
      vasodilatory in nature. This study supports the use of nifedipine GITS in
      patients with chronic stable angina inadequately controlled on beta-blocker
      alone.

TI  - Combined diltiazem and lidocaine reduces cardiovascular responses to tracheal
      extubation and anesthesia emergence in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 952-6
AB  - PURPOSE: Hypertensive patients exhibit exaggerated cardiovascular responses to
      tracheal extubation. This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of
      combined diltiazem and lidocaine with each drug alone in suppressing the
      hemodynamic changes during tracheal extubation. METHODS: Sixty hypertensive
      patients (ASA II), defined as systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic
      blood pressure > 95 mmHg (WHO), undergoing elective orthopedic surgery received, 
      in a randomized, double-blind manner, 0.2 mg x kg(-1) diltiazem, 1.0 mg x kg(-1) 
      lidocaine, or 0.2 mg x kg(-1) diltiazem plus 1.0 mg x kg(-1) lidocaine (n=20 of
      each) i.v. before tracheal extubation. Changes in heart rate (HR), mean arterial 
      pressure (MAP) and rate-pressure product (RPP) were measured before and after
      tracheal extubation. RESULTS: Hemodynamic changes during tracheal extubation were
      less in patients receiving diltiazem plus lidocaine than in those receiving
      diltiazem or lidocaine as a sole medicine (RPP; 10322 +/- 1674 (combined) vs
      11532 +/- 1802 (diltiazem), 15388 +/- 2050 (lidocaine), mean +/- SD, P < 0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Combined diltiazem and lidocaine is more effective prophylaxis than
      diltiazem or lidocaine alone for attenuating the cardiovascular responses to
      tracheal extubation and emergence from anesthesia in hypertensive patients.

TI  - Pharmacovigilance: characteristics of the most widely used drugs in Bulgaria.
PG  - 133-6
AB  - In the present study we analysed registered adverse drug reactions caused by 19
      most used drugs in Bulgaria during three-year period. The cases were assembled
      from the spontaneous reporting system operated in our country. We described
      demographic characteristics of the patients, clinical diagnosis and reporting
      rates per 100,000 inhabitants for each drug. The data for antibiotics were
      compared with the results of our previous research. We analysed 188 adverse drug 
      reactions i.e. 21% of all reports received in the Centre for Drug Safety of the
      National Drug Institute. Adverse drug reactions type B such as oedema, allergy,
      coma, etc. predominate. The number of cases with perforated ulcer and melaena
      caused by acetylsalicylic acid is considerable. The frequency of adverse drug
      reaction for the investigated drugs in "rare" according to WHO standards. It is
      necessary to assemble more information on adverse drug reactions and every
      serious case and inform medical doctors and pharmacists as a first step for
      improving the pharmacovigilance system in Bulgaria.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine on exercise-induced platelet activation in patients affected
      by chronic stable angina.
PG  - 575-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Literature concerning exercise-induced platelet activation in chronic
      stable angina is somewhat confusing. The reason lies in the type of exercise as
      well as in methodological problems. A powerful, recently introduced procedure to 
      detect platelet activation is flow cytometry. Platelet response to activating
      factors is mediated by calcium uptake; however, calcium antagonist effect on
      platelet activity is still unclear. HYPOTHESIS: The study was undertaken to
      investigate exercise-induced platelet activation before and after treatment with 
      amlodipine in chronic stable angina. METHODS: Twenty patients with chronic stable
      angina were entered into the study. Each subject underwent a symptom-limited
      cycloergometer stress test following a washout period of 2 weeks. Blood samples
      were collected before and immediately after exercise. All subjects were then
      randomized into two groups of 10 patients each, with Group 1 and Group 2 taking
      amlodipine 10 mg/day, and placebo for 4 weeks, respectively. They subsequently
      underwent a second exercise stress test, and blood samples were obtained before
      and immediately after exercise. Flow-cytometric evaluation of platelet activity
      was performed in order to recognize GMP-140 expression on platelet membrane.
      RESULTS: Strenuous exercise induced a significant increase in platelet activation
      in all subjects prior to therapy. No significant differences were observed in
      platelet activity at rest between Groups 1 and 2, whereas a significant decrease 
      in exercise-induced platelet activation was demonstrated in Group 1 compared with
      Group 2. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence of the favorable effect of
      amlodipine on exercise-induced platelet activation in patients affected by
      chronic stable angina.

PG  - 1073-8
AB  - The aim of the HOT Study (Hypertension Optimal Treatment) was to determine the
      optimal diastolic blood pressure decrease and to assess the effect of the acetyl 
      salicylic acid as a primary prevention on the cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality in hypertensive patients. The HOT Study is an open, prospective,
      randomised, international trial with blinded end points. This study included
      18,790 patients, 50 to 80 years old (mean 61.5 years) in 26 countries (1,574
      patients in France) with a primary hypertension (100 < or = PAD < or = 115 mmHg).
      The patients were randomised in 3 target diastolic blood pressure: < or = 80 mmHg
      (n = 6,262), < or = 85 mmHg (n = 6,264), < or = 90 mmHg (n = 6,264). The
      felodipine LP, a long acting dihydropyridine, was selected as a first line
      therapy, other hypertension drugs combined if necessary. The lowest incidence of 
      cardiovascular events was observed at a diastolic blood pressure level of 82.6
      mmHg. There was no increased risk below this level even in the hypertensive
      patients with medical history of coronary heart disease or stroke. In the
      diabetic population, the diastolic blood pressure decrease from 90 to 80 reduced 
      the incidence of the major cardiovascular events by 51%. The acetyl salicylic
      acid reduced the myocardial infarction risk in the blood pressure well-controlled
      population.

TI  - Pretreatment with verapamil in patients with persistent or chronic atrial
      fibrillation who underwent electrical cardioversion.
PG  - 810-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate, in a prospective and randomized fashion, the efficacy of
      a pretreatment with verapamil (V) in reducing recurrences of atrial fibrillation 
      (AF) after electrical cardioversion (C). BACKGROUND: The increased vulnerability 
      for AF recurrence is probably due to AF-induced changes in the electrophysiologic
      properties of the atria. This electrical remodeling seems to be due to
      intracellular calcium overload. METHODS: One hundred seven patients with
      persistent or chronic AF underwent external and/or internal C. All patients
      received oral propafenone (P) (900 mg/day) three days before and during the
      entire period of follow-up (three months). In the first group, patients received 
      only the P. In the second group, in adjunct to P, oral V (240 mg/day) was
      initiated three days before C and continued during the follow-up. Finally, in the
      third group, oral V was administered three days before and continued only for
      three days after electrical C. RESULTS: During the three months of follow-up, 23 
      patients (23.7%) had AF recurrence. Mantel-Haenszel cumulative chi-square reached
      a significant level only when comparing AF free survival curves of group I versus
      group II and group III (chi-square = 5.2 and 4, respectively; p < 0.05).
      Significantly, 15 (65.2%) AF relapses occurred during the first week after
      cardioversion with a higher incidence in group I (10/33 patients, 30.3%) than
      group II (2/34 patients, 5.9%; p = 0.01) and group III (3/30 patients, 10%; p =
      0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Six days of oral V administration centered on the C day,
      combined with P, significantly reduce the incidence of early recurrences of AF
      compared with P alone.

TI  - Acute hypotensive, natriuretic, and hormonal effects of nifedipine in
      salt-sensitive and salt-resistant black normotensive and hypertensive subjects.
PG  - 346-53
AB  - In a randomized double-blind study, we compared the short-term effects of
      nifedipine (10 mg 3x daily for 1 day) versus placebo on 24-h blood pressure,
      diuresis, natriuresis, urinary excretion of dopamine and metabolites, and on
      plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone levels in 18 black
      hypertensive (HT) patients [eight salt-resistant (HT-SR) and 10 salt-sensitive
      (HT-SS)], and in 20 black normotensive (NT) subjects (12 NT-SR and eight NT-SS)
      who were studied randomly with both a high- (HS) and a low-salt (LS) diet. In
      comparison to placebo, nifedipine significantly decreased 24-h mean BP in all
      groups either with HS or LS diets (all p<0.05). With HS, greater hypotensive
      effects were achieved in NT-SS (-10+/-2 mm Hg) versus NT-SR (-3+/-1 mm Hg;
      p<0.05) and in HT-SS (-18+/-2 mm Hg) versus HT-SR (-12+/-2 mm Hg; p<0.05). In
      NT-SS and HT-SS, nifedipine induced greater (p<0.05) BP decrease with HS (-10+/-2
      and -18+/-2 mm Hg) than with LS (-4+/-1 and -9+/-1 mm Hg, respectively), whereas 
      in NT-SR and HT-SR, the hypotensive effect did not differ between HS and LS.
      Nifedipine versus placebo significantly increased natriuresis and fractional
      excretion of sodium in all groups only with HS (p<0.05) but not with LS diets.
      Only in HT-SS were the hypotensive and natriuretic effects of nifedipine
      significantly correlated (r = -0.77; p<0.01). Nifedipine produced a similar
      increase of the urinary excretion of dopamine, L-DOPA, and of DOPAC in all
      subjects, which did not correlate with hypotensive and natriuretic effects.
      Nifedipine did not modify plasma levels of renin and of aldosterone except in
      NT-SS with HS, in whom nifedipine increased PRA levels (p <0.05). We conclude
      that although nifedipine reduces BP in all groups of NT and HT with LS and HS
      diets, the effect is greater in salt-sensitive subjects with HS. Although in
      HT-SS with HS, the short-term natriuretic response to nifedipine may contribute
      to its hypotensive effects, the diuretic-natriuretic effect of nifedipine is not 
      necessary for the expression of its hypotensive effect. Moreover, it is unlikely 
      that any short-term effects of nifedipine either on the renal dopaminergic system
      or on the secretion of aldosterone explain nifedipine short-term hypotensive and 
      diuretic-natriuretic effects.

TI  - Comparison of antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of losartan and
      extended-release felodipine in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
PG  - 403-9
AB  - Appropriate control of blood pressure has been shown to reduce morbidity and
      mortality in patients with hypertension. Losartan potassium, a selective
      antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, has been shown to lower
      blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The purpose of this study was to
      compare the efficacy and tolerability of losartan and extended-release (ER)
      felodipine in Taiwanese patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients
      with mild to moderate hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure, 95-115 mm
      Hg) were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, parallel study. Sitting blood 
      pressure, heart rate, adverse reactions, and serum biochemistry values were
      assessed during 2 weeks of placebo and 12 weeks of active treatment. Each patient
      received 50 mg of losartan or 5 mg of felodipine ER once daily, and the dosage
      was adjusted to double the initial level at week 6 if necessary. Of the 44
      patients randomly allocated to receive losartan (n = 23) or felodipine (n = 21)
      therapy, 37 completed the study; three patients in the losartan group and four in
      the felodipine group withdrew because of adverse experiences, or were lost to
      follow-up. The mean reductions in sitting diastolic blood pressure at 6 and 12
      weeks were significant with both losartan (-8.6 and -11.38 mm Hg, respectively)
      and felodipine (-9.2 and -10.69 mm Hg, respectively), and did not differ
      significantly between the two groups. Both losartan and ER felodipine were well
      tolerated by patients. However, the ER felodipine group had a significantly
      higher rate of drug-related flushing than the losartan group (24% vs 0%, p =
      0.022). The results indicate that once-daily administration of losartan is as
      effective and well tolerated as once-daily ER felodipine in blood pressure
      reduction.

TI  - Effects of amlodipine and enalapril on platelet function in patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension.
PG  - 323-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of amlodipine and
      enalapril on platelet aggregation, and platelet production of malondialdehyde in 
      patients with mild to moderate arterial hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
      parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out in 24 patients
      (2 groups of 12 patients each). Initially all patients received placebo for four 
      weeks; then amlodipine, 5 mg daily or enalapril 20 mg daily taken once a day at 7
      am. Dosage was doubled after 4 weeks when diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mmHg 
      in sitting position, the treatment was continued for 12 weeks. At the end of
      placebo and active phases a platelet aggregation test, using adenosine
      diphosphate, collagen and adrenaline, and a platelet malondialdehyde production
      test, either in basal conditions (MDA-basal) and after the stimulation of
      arachidonic acid pathway by adding ethylmaleimide (MDA-activated) were carried
      out. RESULTS: Blood pressure was reduced by both agents, enalapril and
      amlodipine. Enalapril controlled 58.3% of hypertensive patients with an average
      dosage of 31.7 mg/daily. Amlodipine controlled 75% of patients with a dosage of
      7.1 mg/daily. Platelet aggregation was reduced by amlodipine in 15.9% for ADP (10
      microM); 17.4% for collagen (2 microg/ml) and 19.9% for adrenaline (2 microM) (p 
      < 0.025). Meanwhile enalapril slightly increased platelet aggregation by 6.7%,
      1.3% and 5.6% for the three agents, respectively (p > 0.05, ns). Malondialdehyde 
      was reduced by amlodipine in 45.33% (p < 0.05) for MDA-basal; 3.76% (p > 0.05)
      for MDA-activated; and the ratio MDA-basal:MDA-activated in 36.79% (p < 0.005).
      Meanwhile enalapril increased MDA-basal in 2.89%; MDA-activated in 3.58% and
      reduced the ratio MDA-basal:MDA-activated, in 10.34% (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both
      agents, enalapril and amlodipine, reduced blood pressure, but only amlodipine
      reduced platelet aggregation and platelet production of malondialdehyde,
      indicating its action on the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway.

      prednisolone, and cyclosporin A) renal transplant recipients, and 28 generally
      healthy individuals. Patients were grouped into the immunosuppression group, the 
      combined immunosuppression and nifedipine group, the nifedipine group, and the
      generally healthy control group. Five microm-thick cryostat sections were stained
      with monoclonal antibody (mAb) for CD1a using an avidin-biotin-enzyme complex
      (ABC) method. Numbers of CD1a-labeled cells/mm2 were determined in 6 areas: oral 
      epithelium, oral sulcular epithelium, sulcular epithelium, middle connective
      tissue, connective tissue beneath the oral epithelium, and connective tissue
      beneath the sulcular epithelium. Significances of differences between the groups 
      were tested by means of the Kruskall-Wallis test, and significances of
      differences between pairs of results by the Mann-Whitney U-test and the t test.
      RESULTS: Numbers of CD1a-labeled cells were significantly lower in the medicated 
      groups than in controls in all 3 epithelial areas (P <0.0001) and in the
      connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium (P <0.0021). There were
      significantly fewer CD1a-labeled cells in the sulcular epithelium in the
      nifedipine group than in the other medication groups. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced
      numbers of CD1a-labeled cells found in nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth
      were similar to the reduced numbers of CD1a-labeled cells in gingival overgrowth 
      associated with immunosuppressive medication.

TI  - Comparison of clinical efficacy and adverse effects between extended-release
      felodipine and slow-release diltiazem in patients with isolated systolic
      hypertension.
PG  - 44-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is a risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease. Extended-release felodipine (felodipine ER) has been
      shown to be effective in the treatment of ISH in Caucasians. However, its
      pharmacological properties are different from another calcium blocker, diltiazem.
      Also, the effectiveness, tolerability, and adverse reactions of these two
      antihypertensive agents for ISH have not been thoroughly assessed in Chinese.
      METHODS: Sitting blood pressures (BP), heart rate, body weight, adverse
      reactions, and serum biochemistry were assessed in 70 patients with isolated
      systolic hypertension (34 treated with felodipine ER and 36 slow-release
      diltiazem [diltiazem SR] for 10 weeks). Each patient was given 5 mg of felodipine
      ER or 90 mg of diltiazem SR once daily and was doubled to twice daily if
      necessary. RESULTS: Five patients on felodipine ER and four on diltiazem SR
      withdrew because of intolerable side effects. By ten weeks, 67.6% of the patients
      responded to a daily dose of 5-10 mg of felodipine ER and 58.3% to a daily dose
      of 90-180 mg of diltiazem SR. At the end of treatment, felodipine ER lowered the 
      mean BP from 187/83 mmHg at baseline to 149/74 mmHg, whereas diltiazem SR
      decreased the BP from 185/84 mmHg to 158/78 mmHg (not significant between the two
      groups). The heart rate did not change significantly in either group. Overall,
      these two groups of patients had the same rate of adverse reactions (50.0% vs.
      50.0%) with similar profiles of the adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Equivalent doses
      of felodipine ER and diltiazem SR are effective first-line monotherapeutic agents
      for the treatment of ISH.

TI  - Prolonged antihypertensive effect of amlodipine: a prospective double-blind
      randomized study.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - Amlodipine is a calcium antagonist with a long elimination half-life (35 to 50 h)
      allowing a once daily dosing in the treatment of hypertension. This randomized,
      double-blind study was performed to assess the residual antihypertensive effect
      of amlodipine 5 mg O.D. 3 days after discontinuing therapy in previously
      well-controlled mild to moderate hypertensive patients. Blood pressure (BP) was
      evaluated by conventional (OBP) and by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      (ABPM). Amlodipine 5 mg OD administered during a 6-week period, significantly
      reduced both OBP and ABPM mean values (p < 0.05), whereas no change in heart rate
      was observed. At the end of the active treatment period, adequately controlled
      patients were randomized either to amlodipine 5 mg OD (group A) or amlodipine for
      12 days followed by a 3-day period on placebo. After this double-blind treatment 
      phase, group P exhibited no significant increase in BP (assessed by OBP or ABPM) 
      when compared to group A. In conclusion, the duration of action of amlodipine
      extends largely beyond the 24-h span, and when patients omit their treatment for 
      3 days BP does not significantly increase.

TI  - Comparison of two strategies for intensifying antihypertensive treatment:
      low-dose combination (enalapril + felodipine ER) versus increased dose of
      monotherapy (enalapril). LEVEL (Lexxel vs Enalapril) Study Group.
PG  - 691-6
AB  - To compare two popular strategies for intensifying treatment for hypertension, a 
      double-blind, randomized, prospective, parallel-group, and partial crossover
      study was done. After 2 weeks of placebo run-in (baseline) and 3 weeks of 5 mg
      enalapril once daily, 217 patients were randomized to 6 weeks of treatment with
      either a low-dose combination therapy (5 mg enalapril + 5 mg felodipine ER once
      daily, Lexxel, Astra Merck, Inc.), or a higher dose of monotherapy (10 mg
      enalapril once daily, Vasotec, Merck & Co., Inc.). The group randomized to the
      combination had significantly greater reductions in sitting systolic/diastolic
      blood pressure (BP)--14.2/10.6 mm Hg compared with baseline versus 9.6/7.4 mm Hg 
      (P < .05/.01)--as well as a greater percentage of patients having achieved either
      diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg or a decline of at least 10 mm Hg (responders), 59% v 41%
      (P < .01). When patients originally taking 10 mg enalapril were crossed over to
      the combination therapy for a further 6 weeks, there was a further BP reduction
      and increase in response rate, with loss of significant differences compared with
      those treated continuously with the combination for the entire 12 weeks. The
      greater BP-lowering efficacy of the combination was independent of age, gender,
      and race. There were no significant differences in tolerability between the
      regimens. These data support the hypothesis that in patients who do not achieve
      goal BP reduction with a low dose of an antihypertensive agent, a combination of 
      two drugs with complementary mechanisms of action is more effective than
      increasing the dose of the first agent.

TI  - Comparison of verapamil versus felodipine on heart rate variability in
      hypertensive patients.
PG  - 707-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of two calcium channel blockers, verapamil and
      felodipine, on heart rate variability in hypertensive patients. DESIGN: Time and 
      frequency domain measures of heart rate variability were obtained from 24 h
      Holter recording in 25 previously untreated hypertensive patients without left
      ventricular hypertrophy, before and after 3 months of verapamil slow-release
      treatment (240 mg once daily) or felodipine extended-release treatment (10 mg
      once daily). RESULTS: Blood pressure values decreased with both drugs. Measures
      of heart rate variability, comparable at baseline in the two groups, were
      unchanged after felodipine. After verapamil, the average RR interval, the square 
      root of the mean of the squared differences between all adjacent normal RR
      intervals (r-MSSD) and the percentage of differences between all adjacent normal 
      RR intervals > 50 ms (pNN50), measures of vagal modulation of heart rate,
      increased (from 735 +/- 67 to 827 +/- 84 ms, P < 0.001; from 30 +/- 10 to 44 +/- 
      15 ms, P < 0.001; and from 3 +/- 2 to 7 +/- 6%, P < 0.01, respectively) and were 
      higher than after felodipine. The coefficient of variation, a measure that
      compensates for heart rate effects, increased only after verapamil (from 5.8 +/- 
      1.3% to 6.6 +/- 1.0%; P < 0.05). High frequency power and its coefficient of
      component variance, both representing the vagal modulation of heart rate,
      increased after verapamil (from 5.33 +/- 0.29 to 5.80 +/- 0.27 In units, P <
      0.001 and from 1.9 +/- 0.3 to 2.2 +/- 0.25%; P < 0.05). Finally, the low to high 
      frequency power ratio, an indicator of sympathovagal balance, with a high value
      suggesting a sympathetic predominance, decreased after verapamil (from 2.16 +/-
      0.41 to 1.36 +/- 0.35; P < 0.001), confirming the improvement in vagal modulation
      of heart rate. CONCLUSION: In hypertensive patients, despite a comparable
      anti-hypertensive effect, verapamil, but not felodipine, has favourable effect on
      cardiac autonomic control.

TI  - Comparison of bisoprolol and verapamil in hypertension: influence on left
      ventricular mass and function--a pilot study.
PG  - 217-22
AB  - The objective of this study was to test the influence of bisoprolol and verapamil
      on left ventricular filling in hypertensive patients in a 6 month randomized,
      double-blind trial in 54 hypertensive patients not previously treated with
      beta-blockers or calcium inhibitors. After administration of placebo for 14 days,
      an M echocardiogram of the left ventricle was recorded to determine left
      ventricular mass. Blood flow was evaluated by pulsed Doppler sonography. After
      randomization into two groups, one group received 10 mg of bisoprolol and the
      other 240 mg of verapamil LP in a single dose in the morning. After 2 months'
      treatment, the patients whose blood pressure was not well controlled were given a
      diuretic. Echo-Doppler was performed again by the same operator after 4-10 days
      on active treatment, after 6 months and after a subsequent 2 weeks of placebo for
      the patients treated with a single drug. The reduction in blood pressure was
      comparable in the two treated groups, but there was no significant decrease in
      left ventricular mass. Left ventricular filling was improved only in the patients
      receiving bisoprolol. The effect was observed immediately after the first
      administration and throughout the 6 months' treatment period declining slowly
      during the placebo wash-out. This effect appeared to be independent of any
      alteration in heart rate and was thought to be a specific action of this drug.

TI  - [Lowering of diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg should not be attempted,
      except in type 2 diabetics; the 'Hypertension optimal treatment' (HOT) trial].
PG  - 1188-91
AB  - Recently the 'Hypertension optimal treatment' (HOT) study was reported. In this
      study 18,790 patients with diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 115 mmHg were
      randomly assigned target pressures of < or = 90, < or = 85 and < or = 80 mmHg
      respectively, and treated with a felodipine-based antihypertensive regimen. In
      all three groups an impressive fall in both diastolic and systolic blood
      pressures, and as a consequence very few major cardiovascular events (the primary
      endpoint of the study) were observed, but there was no difference in endpoint
      scores among the three groups. Type 2 diabetic patients fared substantially
      better than non-diabetic patients and they are likely to profit if their
      diastolic pressure is decreased below 80 mmHg. In the remaining patients rigorous
      maintenance of present-day standards (diastolic pressure < or = 90 mmHg) is
      advised. The addition of 75 mg aspirin 1 dd resulted in a modest but significant 
      reduction of major cardiovascular events, but at the cost of increased
      gastrointestinal bleedings.

TI  - Meta-analysis of trials comparing beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and
      nitrates for stable angina.
PG  - 1927-36
AB  - CONTEXT: Which drug is most effective as a first-line treatment for stable angina
      is not known. OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative efficacy and tolerability of
      treatment with beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and long-acting nitrates for
      patients who have stable angina. DATA SOURCES: We identified English-language
      studies published between 1966 and 1997 by searching the MEDLINE and EMBASE
      databases and reviewing the bibliographies of identified articles to locate
      additional relevant studies. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized or crossover studies
      comparing antianginal drugs from 2 or 3 different classes (beta-blockers, calcium
      antagonists, and long-acting nitrates) lasting at least 1 week were reviewed.
      Studies were selected if they reported at least 1 of the following outcomes:
      cardiac death, myocardial infarction, study withdrawal due to adverse events,
      angina frequency, nitroglycerin use, or exercise duration. Ninety (63%) of 143
      identified studies met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent
      reviewers extracted data from selected articles, settling any differences by
      consensus. Outcome data were extracted a third time by 1 of the investigators. We
      combined results using odds ratios (ORs) for discrete data and mean differences
      for continuous data. Studies of calcium antagonists were grouped by duration and 
      type of drug (nifedipine vs nonnifedipine). DATA SYNTHESIS: Rates of cardiac
      death and myocardial infarction were not significantly different for treatment
      with beta-blockers vs calcium antagonists (OR, 0.97; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 0.67-1.38; P = .79). There were 0.31 (95% CI, 0.00-0.62; P = .05) fewer
      episodes of angina per week with beta-blockers than with calcium antagonists.
      beta-Blockers were discontinued because of adverse events less often than were
      calcium antagonists (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.86; P<.001). The differences
      between beta-blockers and calcium antagonists were most striking for nifedipine
      (OR for adverse events with beta-blockers vs nifedipine, 0.60; 95% CI,
      0.47-0.77). Too few trials compared nitrates with calcium antagonists or
      beta-blockers to draw firm conclusions about relative efficacy. CONCLUSIONS:
      beta-Blockers provide similar clinical outcomes and are associated with fewer
      adverse events than calcium antagonists in randomized trials of patients who have
      stable angina.

TI  - Cyclosporin-induced hypertension: incidence, pathogenesis and management.
PG  - 437-49
AB  - Blood pressure increases soon after administration of immunosuppressive regimens 
      using cyclosporin. Characteristic vascular changes lead to systemic and renal
      vasoconstriction. Changes in blood pressure are commonly associated with
      disturbed circadian regulation and may promote the rapid development of target
      organ injury, including intracranial haemorrhage, left ventricular hypertrophy
      and microangiopathic haemolysis. The mechanisms underlying this disorder are
      complex and include altered vascular endothelial function. Vasodilators such as
      prostacyclin and nitric oxide are suppressed, whereas vasoconstrictors, including
      endothelin, are increased. Changes in the kidney include vasoconstriction,
      reduced glomerular filtration and sodium retention. Effective therapy depends
      upon rigorous blood pressure control by administration of vasodilating agents,
      with attention to potential interactions with cyclosporin.

TI  - Hypotension and coronary events on nifedipine: reassessing nifedipine safety.
PG  - 90-1
AB  - Nifedipine administration for hypertensive emergencies can induce neurological
      and cardiac events due to abrupt hypotension. Nifedipine also increase the risk
      of coronary events in case of unstable angina or recent myocardial infarction. In
      hypertensive emergencies, the potential advantages and risks of achieving a rapid
      fall in arterial pressure should be assessed case by case. In patients with
      coronary heart disease, nifedipine is contraindicated in case of recent
      myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Nifedipine is only a second-line choice
      for stable angina, and should be combined with a betablocker.

TI  - Sustained-release nifedipine: new indication. Angina: safer drugs are available.
PG  - 71-3
AB  - The efficacy of sustained-release osmotic tablets of nifedipine in the
      symptomatic treatment of stable angina is poorly documented. The safety of
      nifedipine remains uncertain, as high-dose treatment with immediate-release
      preparations increased mortality in trials involving coronary patients. In
      angina, nifedipine can be used only in combination with a betablocker, and only
      to treat patients with no recent history of myocardial infarction, or unstable
      angina. In stable angina with inadequate symptom control by betablockers, it is
      no more effective than other dihydropyridines also indicated in the treatment of 
      angina, i.e. amlodipine and felodipine. Furthermore, medium-term data on
      amlodipine are relatively reassuring. Nifedipine appears a little more effective 
      than sustained-release nitrate derivatives, but less safe.

TI  - Retrospective analysis of the frequency and recognition of adverse drug reactions
      by means of automatically recorded laboratory signals.
PG  - 557-64
AB  - AIMS: To estimate the frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified
      through the use of automatic signals generated from laboratory data (ALS) in
      hospitalised patients. To determine the frequency of spontaneous recognition of
      these ADRs by the attending physicians and to assess the potential value of ALS
      for detection of ADRs. METHODS: Laboratory results of patients hospitalised in a 
      nine bed medical ward were automatically recorded over a period of 17 months.
      Values exceeding defined boundaries were used as ALS. Charts of every third
      patient were analysed retrospectively with regard to adverse drug related
      reactions and causality was evaluated as well as whether the ADR had been
      recognised during the period of hospitalisation. RESULTS: The charts and ALS of
      98 patients were analysed. In 18 cases a drug-related adverse reaction was
      probable. Awareness to the reaction by the treating physicians was evident in 6
      out of these 18 ADRs. Approximately 80% of the ADRs were considered predictable. 
      Three ADRs were regarded as serious. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug reactions are
      common and often preventable. Only one third of ADRs which could have been
      detected through ALS were recognised by the attending physicians. An increased
      doctor's awareness of the frequency of drug related abnormal laboratory results
      by means of ALS is likely to increase the recognition rate of ADRs and might help
      to prevent them.

TI  - Hypertensive crisis. How to tell if it's an emergency or an urgency.
PG  - 119-26, 130
AB  - Hypertensive crisis occurs when critically elevated blood pressure is accompanied
      by diastolic pressure greater than 120 to 130 mm Hg. The presence of acute or
      ongoing end-organ damage constitutes a hypertensive emergency, which requires
      reduction of blood pressure within minutes to hours to avoid catastrophic
      outcomes. Critically elevated blood pressure without end-organ damage is known as
      a hypertensive urgency, which is generally treated over 24 to 48 hours in a
      closely monitored outpatient setting. Although hypertensive crises are relatively
      rare, most primary care physicians will eventually encounter them. Thus, for
      optimal patient outcomes, it is important to be aware of appropriate treatment
      options as well as the impact of potential complications on management.

      secondary objective was to compare the tolerability of the 3 treatments. METHODS:
      The main criteria for inclusion were stable effort-induced angina pectoris for at
      least 2 months before the enrollment and a positive bicycle exercise test result.
      Patients were allocated to once-daily treatment with either felodipine-metoprolol
      10/100 mg, felodipine 10 mg, or metoprolol 100 mg. The duration of active
      double-blind treatment was 4 weeks. There were 3 primary efficacy variables in
      the study; time until end of exercise, time until onset of chest discomfort, and 
      time until 1-mm ST depression during a standardized exercise test. RESULTS: The
      number of patients randomized was 397. There was a statistically significant
      improvement in time until end of exercise with felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg
      compared with metoprolol 100 mg (P =.04) and felodipine 10 mg compared with
      metoprolol 100 mg ( P =.03). However, for time until onset of pain or time until 
      1-mm ST-depression there were no significant differences among the treatment
      groups. At highest comparable workload, ST depression was less pronounced with
      felodipine-metoprolol than with metoprolol alone (P =.04), and the rate-pressure 
      product was significantly lower in the groups receiving felodipine-metoprolol and
      metoprolol than in the group receiving felodipine alone. The combination and
      metoprolol were better tolerated than felodipine alone. CONCLUSIONS: In stable
      angina pectoris, the combination felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg and felodipine
      10 mg alone increased exercise time compared with metoprolol 100 mg. The
      combination tablet and metoprolol 100 mg alone showed a more favorable
      tolerability profile than felodipine 10 mg alone.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure profiles in essential hypertensives after treatment
      with a new once daily nifedipine formulation.
PG  - 173-7
AB  - The antihypertensive efficacy of a new controlled-release preparation of
      nifedipine developed for once daily administration was investigated in comparison
      with a standard therapy with sustained-release nifedipine given twice daily in a 
      randomised, open crossover trial. Twenty-two patients with mild to moderate
      essential hypertension were enrolled. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)
      was performed after a wash-out period and after a 3 weeks treatment with 40 mg
      controlled-release nifedipine once daily and 20 mg sustained-release nifedipine
      twice daily, respectively. ABPM data were evaluated by conventional linear
      analysis and by rhythm analysis. Both once daily and twice daily administration
      of nifedipine significantly reduced systolic blood pressure during the daytime
      and during the night when compared with baseline. The 24-h diastolic blood
      pressure was significantly decreased by both treatments, but only the once daily 
      regimen significantly lowered both diastolic daytime and night-time means.
      Comparing systolic and diastolic blood pressures after both treatments, however, 
      no significant differences were obtained. Both nifedipine treatments did neither 
      greatly modify the circadian blood pressure pattern nor reflexly increase heart
      rate. In conclusion, once daily application of the controlled-release formulation
      of nifedipine resulted in a consistent and significant blood pressure reduction. 
      Once daily and twice daily medications of nifedipine were about equally effective
      in lowering the elevated blood pressures.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers in myocardial and cerebral ischemia: a clinician's
      review from bench to bedside.
PG  - 333-40
AB  - Calcium channel blockers constitute a very important group of drugs that are
      commonly used in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders.
      Current indications for these medications include hypertension, angina,
      supraventricular arrhythmias, and prevention of coronary and cerebral vasospasm. 
      Although calcium channel blockers originally held great promise in the treatment 
      of myocardial and cerebral ischemia, clinical results have been discouraging. An 
      understanding of the basic physiological mechanisms of actions for these drugs is
      important for the practising clinician and may explain the disappointing results 
      for the treatment of ischemia to date. This paper is a narrative review, from a
      clinician's viewpoint, of the structure and role of calcium channels in cardiac
      and cerebrovascular tissues, as well as a review of the in vitro and clinical
      results of calcium channel blockade in myocardial and cerebral ischemia.

TI  - A double blind comparison of the effects of amlodipine and enalapril on insulin
      sensitivity in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 298-303
AB  - This study compares the effects of a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and an 
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) on in vivo insulin
      sensitivity in patients with essential hypertension. Forty-six patients with mild
      and moderate hypertension were studied. After a 2-week single-blind placebo
      phase, they were randomly assigned to double-blind therapy with either amlodipine
      (2.5 to 10 mg/day) or enalapril (5 to 40 mg/day) for 16 weeks. Both groups were
      comparable in terms of demographic characteristics, degree of obesity, metabolic 
      parameters, and arterial blood pressure. Insulin sensitivity was measured at
      baseline and at week 16 during the active phase using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic
      clamps. Arterial blood pressure decreased similarly in both groups. Whole body
      glucose uptake (M-value) increased with amlodipine from 3.63 +/- 0.32 (mean +/-
      SEM) to 3.97 +/- 0.31 mg/kg/min (P = .02). A similar tendency was observed with
      enalapril: from 3.59 +/- 0.32 to 3.94 +/- 0.30 mg/kg/min (P = .09). A trend to
      lower steady-state insulin level during the second clamp (compared to baseline)
      was observed in both groups. The clamp-derived insulin sensitivity index (that
      corrects for steady-state insulin levels and glucose levels during the clamp)
      increased similarly in both groups: from 1.15 +/- 0.11 to 1.39 +/- 0.13 with
      amlodipine (P = .03) and from 1.25 +/- 0.13 to 1.49 +/- 0.16 with enalapril (P = 
      .01). LDL cholesterol decreased with amlodipine (mean change, -11.3 mg/dL, P =
      .004). Amlodipine and enalapril were associated with increments in insulin
      sensitivity. Amlodipine provided an additional benefit with decreased low density
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

TI  - The prevalence and etiology of impotence in 101 male hypertensive outpatients.
PG  - 271-5
AB  - Erectile dysfunction and impotence has a high prevalence among male hypertensive 
      patients. Whether this relates mainly to specific drug side effects or to primary
      pathogenic disorders is unknown. In the present study 101 male patients from our 
      outpatient hypertension clinic answered detailed questionnaires about
      hypertension and sexual function. Patients with perceived impotence were offered 
      a thorough penile evaluation and examination performed by specialists in the
      urology department. Twenty-seven (27%) men had impotence. The main cause of
      impotence was an arterial dysfunction (89%). The prevalence of impotence was
      related to the degree of secondary organ manifestation, reflected by World Health
      Organization (WHO) classification I-III (P = .01). Intermittent claudication (P =
      .001) and ischemic heart disease (P = .005) were the best determinants in this
      respect. Twelve impotent patients (44%) ascribed onset of impotence to drug
      initiation. A variety of drugs were incriminated in the occurrence of
      drug-induced impotence. In summary our results indicate that impotence in
      hypertensive men is caused mainly by penile arterial vascular changes, probably
      atherosclerosis. Drug-induced impotence could well be the result of blood
      pressure reduction itself and not specific drug side effects.

TI  - Controlled study of the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition versus
      calcium-entry blockade on insulin sensitivity in overweight hypertensive
      patients: Trandolapril Italian Study (TRIS).
PG  - 439-45
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of trandolapril, an
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on blood pressure, forearm blood flow
      and insulin sensitivity in comparison with nifedipine gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a multicentre, two-way
      parallel-group, open-label comparative study in 90 overweight hypertensive
      patients, who were randomly assigned to treatment for 8 weeks with either
      trandolapril or nifedipine. At baseline and after treatment, all patients
      underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, an evaluation of their metabolic
      profiles and a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp test. In a subgroup of 18
      patients, a forearm study was carried out. RESULTS: Blood pressure fell by the
      second week of treatment and remained significantly reduced compared with
      baseline in both treatment groups. Plasma triglyceride levels were also
      significantly reduced after trandolapril therapy, but no significant changes
      occurred in the other metabolic parameters during treatment with either drug.
      During the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp, whole-body glucose use was
      similar in the two treatment groups at baseline, and a moderate but statistically
      significant increase in insulin sensitivity was observed after trandolapril
      treatment (trandolapril: 5.0 +/- 0.2 versus 4.5 +/- 0.2 mg/kg per min;
      nifedipine: 4.1 +/- 0.3 versus 4.2 +/- 0.3 mg/kg per min; P < 0.05, versus
      baseline and trandolapril versus nifedipine treatment). Skeletal muscle glucose
      uptake was significantly higher after trandolapril than after nifedipine therapy 
      (5.0 +/- 0.7 and 3.0 +/- 0.4 mg/min, respectively; P < 0.01). As forearm blood
      flow was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline and was unchanged after 
      8 weeks of therapy, skeletal muscle glucose extraction was significantly greater 
      in the ACE inhibitor treated-group than in the nifedipine comparative group
      (trandolapril: baseline 21 +/- 2, treatment 24 +/- 3 mg/dl; nifedipine: baseline 
      18 +/- 3, treatment 16 +/- 2 mg/dl; P < 0.05, trandolapril versus nifedipine
      treatment). CONCLUSIONS: During short-term treatment, ACE inhibition with
      trandolapril was able to moderately improve insulin sensitivity, in comparison
      with calcium blockade, and this effect appeared to be independent of the
      haemodynamic action of the drug.

      diastolic BP 4 +/- 3 mm Hg, P = 0.16). Twenty-four hour BP was also reduced by
      nifedipine treatment (by 18 +/- 3/9 +/- 2 mm Hg, both P < 0.001). Clinic and 24-h
      heart rate, and daytime BP variability, were unchanged with treatment. BRS was
      significantly increased during nifedipine therapy by all three measurement
      methods (all P < 0.05). With 60 degrees tilt during active treatment, subjects
      exhibited a greater heart rate increase (P < 0.01), and a reduced fall in
      systolic (P < 0.05) and diastolic BP (P < 0.05). Thus despite the
      arteriosclerosis and reductions in large artery compliance described in elderly
      patients with isolated systolic hypertension, clinically important improvements
      in clinic and ambulatory BP and some aspects of cardiovascular homeostasis can be
      achieved with calcium-channel blocking therapy.

TI  - Clinical and neurohormonal effects of nicardipine hydrochloride in patients with 
      severe chronic heart failure receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
      therapy.
PG  - 25-32
AB  - It has been proposed that worsening of heart failure with dihydropyridines, such 
      as nicardipine, is related to the activation of the neuroendocrine system. To
      test this, we evaluated 20 patients with severe heart failure (mean age, 55 +/-
      13 years; New York Heart Association functional class III; left ventricular
      ejection fraction, 18% +/- 8% on maintenance therapy with captopril, digoxin, and
      diuretics) who were randomized to nicardipine (60 or 90 mg/d) or placebo during a
      4-month double-blind protocol. The following measurements were obtained at
      baseline, monthly, and at 4 months or last follow-up visit: rest and exercise
      radionuclide ventriculography, maximal treadmill time, 6-minute walking test
      distance, serum norepinephrine and aldosterone concentrations, and plasma renin
      activity. During the follow-up period, worsening of heart failure occurred in 6
      patients in the nicardipine group and in 2 patients in the placebo group (p =
      0.06). The maximal treadmill time for a 6-minute walking distance and exercise
      radionuclide ejection fraction at the last follow-up visit did not change in
      patients who did not deteriorate with heart failure in the placebo or nicardipine
      groups as compared with baseline values. In this study group of patients with
      severe heart failure receiving therapy with digoxin, captopril, and diuretics,
      nicardipine was associated with worsening heart failure without an apparent
      activation of the neurohormones. However, because of the small number of patients
      and a significant number of patients who deteriorated during the follow-up
      period, no definitive conclusions can be made.

TI  - [The additional efficacy of the nifedipine-diuretic combination depends on the
      potency of the drug administered first and not the sequence of administration. A 
      double blind study in salt-sensitive black hypertensives].
PG  - 9-19
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the additional antihypertensive efficacy of the
      nifedipine-thiazide combination depends on the sequence of drug administration
      and whether the natriuretic effect of thiazide persists when co-administered with
      nifedipine. METHODS: Double blind, randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled
      study, in 12 salt-sensitive hypertensive black patients (SSH). Evaluation of the 
      antihypertensive (24 h ambulatory monitoring) and natriuretic effects of placebo 
      (PL), of nifedipine-GITS (NIF, 30 mg/d) and of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 25
      mg/d) given alone and in combination within two separate therapeutic sequences:
      PL-->NIF-->NIF + HCTZ and PL-->HCTZ-->HCTZ + NIF (1 month for each therapeutic
      regimen). RESULTS: NIF induced greater (p < 0.04) reduction of 24 h mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) (-15.9 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, v PL) than HCTZ (-9.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg). The
      association of NIF to HCTZ induced a greater (p < 0.05) additional reduction of
      MAP-24 h (9.7 +/- 2.2 mm Hg) than that produced by the association of HCTZ to NIF
      (4.1 +/- 1.3 mm Hg). NIF alone and in combination did not modify the
      diuresis-natriuresis observed with the previous treatment, whereas HCTZ alone and
      in combination always increased diuresis (by 25%) and natriuresis (by 53%). There
      was a significant negative correlation (r = -0.71, p < 0.001) between blood
      pressure (BP) reduction induced by the drug administered first (NIF or HCTZ) and 
      the additional BP reduction obtained by the association of the second drug.
      CONCLUSIONS: In most of the SSH the NIF-GITS was more potent than HCTZ. NIF did
      not modify the diuretic-natriuretic effect of PL and of HCTZ. The greater potency
      of NIF may explain why in most patients the combination HCTZ to NIF induced a
      lower hypotensive effect than that of the association of NIF to HCTZ.
      Independently of the sequence of the drug administration, the lower the
      hypotensive effect of the drug administered first the greater the additional
      hypotensive effect that was observed by adding the second drug.

TI  - Comparison of controlled-onset, extended-release verapamil with amlodipine and
      amlodipine plus atenolol on exercise performance and ambulatory ischemia in
      patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.
PG  - 507-14
AB  - This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo lead-in,
      placebo-controlled study compared the antianginal and anti-ischemic effects of
      once-daily bedtime dosing of controlled-onset extended-release (COER-24)
      verapamil to a once-daily morning dosing of amlodipine +/- atenolol in patients
      with chronic stable angina. A total of 551 patients with exercise-induced
      myocardial ischemia and evidence of coronary artery disease were randomized to a 
      4-week, forced-dose titration treatment period with (1) COER-24 verapamil 240 mg 
      titrated to 480 mg at bedtime (n = 173), (2) amlodipine 5 mg titrated to 10
      mg/day (n = 149), (3) amlodipine 5 mg (titrated to 10 mg) plus atenolol 50 mg/day
      in the A.M. (n = 154), or (4) placebo (n = 75). Treadmill exercise tolerance
      testing (standard Bruce protocol), and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic
      (Holter) monitoring were performed at the end of placebo lead-in and double-blind
      treatment. Each active treatment significantly improved symptom-limited exercise 
      duration and time to moderate angina (p < or = 0.01 vs placebo). For patients
      with baseline ischemia, amlodipine resulted in a statistically significant
      increase in total duration of ischemic episodes compared with placebo, whereas
      COER-24 verapamil and amlodipine plus atenolol resulted in statistically
      significant decreases compared with placebo and amlodipine. Heart rate at onset
      of ischemic episodes and ST product were also significantly increased with
      amlodipine (p < 0.05) compared with either COER-24 or amlodipine plus atenolol.
      COER-24 and amlodipine alone or in combination with atenolol improved exercise
      capacity in patients with angina pectoris. COER-24 verapamil monotherapy or
      amlodipine plus atenolol combination therapy were more effective than amlodipine 
      monotherapy in decreasing ambulatory myocardial ischemia, especially during the
      hours of 6 A.M. to 12 noon.

TI  - Effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition compared with conventional
      therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertension: the Captopril 
      Prevention Project (CAPPP) randomised trial.
PG  - 611-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been used for
      more than a decade to treat high blood pressure, despite the lack of data from
      randomised intervention trials to show that such treatment affects cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality. The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a randomised
      intervention trial to compare the effects of ACE inhibition and conventional
      therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension. 
      METHODS: CAPPP was a prospective, randomised, open trial with blinded endpoint
      evaluation. 10,985 patients were enrolled at 536 health centres in Sweden and
      Finland. Patients aged 25-66 years with a measured diastolic blood pressure of
      100 mm Hg or more on two occasions were randomly assigned captopril or
      conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blockers). Analysis was 
      by intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal and
      non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths.
      FINDINGS: Of 5492 patients assigned captopril and 5493 assigned conventional
      therapy, 14 and 13, respectively, were lost to follow-up. Primary endpoint events
      occurred in 363 patients in the captopril group (11.1 per 1000 patient-years) and
      335 in the conventional-treatment group (10.2 per 1000 patient-years; relative
      risk 1.05 [95% CI 0.90-1.22], p=0-52). Cardiovascular mortality was lower with
      captopril than with conventional treatment (76 vs 95 events; relative risk 0.77
      [0.57-1-04], p=0.092), the rate of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction was 
      similar (162 vs 161), but fatal and non-fatal stroke was more common with
      captopril (189 vs 148; 1.25 [1-01-1-55]. p=0.044). INTERPRETATION: Captopril and 
      conventional treatment did not differ in efficacy in preventing cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality. The difference in stroke risk is probably due to the
      lower levels of blood pressure obtained initially in previously treated patients 
      randomised to conventional therapy.

TI  - Irbesartan reduces QT dispersion in hypertensive individuals.
PG  - 713-8
AB  - Angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists have direct effects on the autonomic
      nervous system and myocardium. Because of this, we hypothesized that irbesartan
      would reduce QT dispersion to a greater degree than amlodipine, a highly
      selective vasodilator. To test this, we gathered electrocardiographic (ECG) data 
      from a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind parallel group study 
      that compared the antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan and amlodipine in
      elderly subjects with mild to moderate hypertension. Subjects were treated for 6 
      months with either drug. Hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol were added after 12
      weeks if blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled. ECGs were obtained before
      randomization and at 6 months. A total of 188 subjects (118 with baseline ECGs)
      were randomized. We analyzed 104 subjects who had complete ECGs at baseline and
      after 6 months of treatment. Baseline characteristics between treatments were
      similar, apart from a slight imbalance in diastolic BP (irbesartan [n=53] versus 
      amlodipine [n=51], 99.2 [SD 3. 6] versus 100.8 [3.8] mm Hg; P=0.03). There were
      no significant differences in BP normalization (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg) between
      treatments at 6 months (irbesartan versus amlodipine, 80% versus 88%; P=0.378).
      We found a significant reduction in QT indexes in the irbesartan group (QTc
      dispersion mean, -11.4 [34.5] milliseconds, P=0.02; QTc max, -12.8 [35.5]
      milliseconds, P=0.01), and QTc dispersion did not correlate with the change in
      BP. The reduction in QT indexes with amlodipine (QTc dispersion, -9.7 [35.4]
      milliseconds, P=0.06; QTc max, -8.6 [33.2] milliseconds, P=0.07) did not quite
      reach statistical significance, but there was a correlation between the change in
      QT indexes and changes in systolic BP. In conclusion, irbesartan improved QT
      dispersion, and this effect may be important in preventing sudden cardiac death
      in at-risk hypertensive subjects.

TI  - Comparison of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure data in hypertensive patients
      switched from nifedipine-GITS to nifedipine-CC.
PG  - 94-100
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 24-hour blood pressure control and frequency of
      adverse effects in patients with mild to moderate hypertension switched from
      nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (Nif-GITS) to nifedipine coat core
      (Nif-CC). DESIGN: Open-label, prospective, switch study SETTING:
      University-affiliated outpatient cardiology clinic. SUBJECTS: Twenty patients
      with mild to moderate essential hypertension, who were taking Nif-GITS 30, 60, or
      90 mg/day for 8 weeks or longer. INTERVENTIONS: Patients stabilized with Nif-GITS
      30, 60, or 90 mg were monitored over 24 hours with an ambulatory blood pressure
      monitor and were then switched to an equivalent dosage of Nif-CC. After 8
      weeks+/-1 week taking Nif-CC, they were again monitored with a 24-hour blood
      pressure monitor. The 24-hour blood pressure load (percentage of values > 135/85 
      mm Hg for 24 hrs), daytime blood pressure load (percentage of values > 140/90 mm 
      Hg from 7:00 A.M.-10:00 P.M.), nighttime blood pressure load (percentage of
      values > 120/80 mm Hg from 10:00 P.M.-7:00 A.M.), diurnal blood pressure
      variation, average 24-hour blood pressure, daytime blood pressure, nighttime
      blood pressure, mean blood pressure for the first 4 hours, and last 8 hours of
      the dosing interval were measured. Adverse effects such as headache, dizziness,
      and edema were also reported. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No differences in
      average 24 hour-blood pressure readings were observed but significant differences
      in blood pressure control during the first 4 and last 8 hours of the dosing
      interval were seen. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher after
      approximately 16 hours in patients switched from Nif-GITS to Nif-CC. Although
      Nif-CC caused a greater initial response, it was less effective than Nif-GITS
      after 16 hours. This could explain the lack of differences in average 24-hour
      blood pressure values between formulations. Of the 20 patients, 20% experienced
      increased headaches, 20% showed signs of increased peripheral edema, and 10%
      reported occasional dizziness after switching agents. Three patients discontinued
      Nif-CC, two as ordered by their primary care physician and one on his own due to 
      headache. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that patients switched from Nif-GITS to
      Nif-CC could experience increased blood pressure during the night or toward the
      end of the dosing interval. They could also experience adverse effects such as
      headache, edema, and dizziness, which could result in more physician visits and
      put patients with other disease states such as coronary heart disease at
      increased risk.

TI  - The Verapamil in Hypertension and Atherosclerosis Study (VHAS): results of
      long-term randomized treatment with either verapamil or chlorthalidone on carotid
      intima-media thickness.
PG  - 1667-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the carotid intima-media thickness can be
      influenced by antihypertensive treatment and whether some antihypertensive
      agents, such as calcium antagonists, may have a greater effect on this parameter 
      than others, such as diuretics. The present paper reports the principal results
      of the ultrasound substudy of the randomized, prospective, controlled, Verapamil 
      in Hypertension and Atherosclerosis Study (VHAS). DESIGN AND METHODS: In 498
      hypertensive patients in eight Italian centres, randomized to either verapamil
      (240 mg once a day) or chlorthalidone (25 mg once a day), a B-mode ultrasound
      scan was performed according to a standardized procedure at baseline and after 3,
      12, 24, 36 and 48 months of treatment. The maximum intima-media thicknesses of
      the far walls of common, bifurcation and internal carotid arteries were measured 
      bilaterally, and the following indices calculated: the mean thickness at the six 
      measured sites, the mean thickness at the common and bifurcation sites and the
      single maximum thickness. The primary endpoint for treatment efficacy was the
      slope of the change over 4 years (rate of change, mm/year), corrected by using
      the initial mean over the six sites (baseline + 3 months) as a covariate (mm/year
      per mm). The patients were also classified into three strata according to their
      baseline single maximum thickness: those with normal carotid arteries (single
      maximum ( 1 mm), those with thickened carotid arteries (single maximum > 1 and < 
      or = 1.5 mm and those with carotid plaques (single maximum > 1.5 mm). RESULTS:
      Among the 456 patients with satisfactory baseline ultrasound readings, 33% were
      classified with normal carotid arteries, 27% with thickened carotid arteries and 
      40% with plaques. In the intention-to-treat population (377 patients with
      ultrasound measurements taken on at least three different occasions over a period
      of at least 2 years), the rate of change in the mean thickness at the six sites
      measured was rather small (0.015 mm/year), but significantly (P < 0.05) smaller
      in patients with plaques (0.003 mm/year) than in patients with thickened or with 
      normal carotids (0.023 and 0.025 mm/year, respectively). When related to initial 
      values, the rate of change in the mean thickness at the six sites had a negative 
      slope (-0.059 mm/year per mm, P < 0.01). Although rates of change in the carotid 
      intima-media thickness in unstratified patients were not different in those
      treated with verapamil or with chlorthalidone, when changes in the mean thickness
      of six sites were related to the initial value, the slope of this relationship
      was significantly different in the two treatment groups (verapamil -0.082 versus 
      chlorthalidone -0.037 mm/year per mm, P < 0.02). The blood pressure-lowering
      effect of the two randomized treatments was similar. Taking fatal and nonfatal,
      major and minor cardiovascular events together, there were 19 events in the
      verapamil group and 35 in the chlorthalidone group, with a significantly (P <
      0.01) greater incidence in patients with plaques, and among patients with plaques
      in those who were randomized to chlorthalidone (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In accord
      with evidence from animal models of atherosclerosis, the calcium antagonist
      verapamil was more effective than the diuretic chlorthalidone in promoting
      regression of thicker carotid lesions. Changes in the carotid intima-media
      thickness were small in both groups, and the differences between the changes
      under the two treatments were consequently small, but the observation that these 
      small differences in carotid wall changes were paralleled by differences in the
      incidence of cardiovascular events (better intima-media thickness regression with
      verapamil paralleled by a lower cardiovascular event rate) suggests that even
      small effects on carotid plaques may have clinical and prognostic relevance.

TI  - Diltiazem-lidocaine combination for the attenuation of cardiovascular responses
      to tracheal intubation in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 933-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Hypertensive patients are prone to haemodynamic changes after
      laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. This study was undertaken to compare the
      efficacy of a combination of diltiazem and lidocaine with that of each drug alone
      for suppressing the cardiovascular responses to tracheal intubation. METHODS:
      Sixty hypertensive patients (ASA II), defined as systolic blood pressure > 160
      mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg (World Health Organization),
      undergoing elective surgery received, in a randomized, double-blind manner, 0.3
      mg.kg-1 diltiazem, 1.5 mg.kg-1 lidocaine, or 0.3 mg.kg-1 diltiazem plus 1.5
      mg.kg-1 lidocaine i.v. (n = 20 of each) before the initiation of laryngoscopy.
      Anaesthesia was induced with 5 mg.kg-1 thiopentone i.v., and tracheal intubation 
      was facilitated with 2 mg.kg-1 succinylcholine i.v. after precurarization with
      0.02 mg.kg-1 vecuronium i.v. Changes in heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure
      (MAP) and rate-pressure product (RPP) were measured before and at immediate, 1,
      2, 3, 5 and 10 min after tracheal intubation. RESULTS: The inhibitory effects of 
      diltiazem-lidocaine combination on cardiovascular responses to tracheal
      intubation was greater than those of diltiazem or lidocaine as a sole medicine
      (RPP; 10,602 +/- 1448 (combination) vs 11,787 +/- 1345 (diltiazem), 15,428 +/-
      1756 (lidocaine), mean +/- SD, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Prophylactic therapy with
      diltiazem-lidocaine combination is more effective than diltiazem or lidocaine
      alone for attenuating the cardiovascular changes associated with tracheal
      intubation in hypertensive patients.

TI  - Beta-adrenergic blockade accelerates conversion of postoperative supraventricular
      tachyarrhythmias.
PG  - 1052-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative supraventricular tachyarrhythmia is a common
      complication of surgery. Because chemical cardioversion is often ineffective,
      ventricular rate control remains a principal goal of therapy. The authors
      hypothesized that patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia after major
      noncardiac surgery who receive intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade for
      ventricular rate control would experience conversion to sinus rhythm at a rate
      that differs from those receiving intravenous calcium channel blockade. METHODS: 
      The rate of conversion to sinus rhythm at 2 and 12 h after treatment was examined
      in 64 cases of postoperative supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. After adenosine
      administration, patients who remained in supraventricular tachyarrhythmia were
      prospectively randomized to receive either intravenous diltiazem or intravenous
      esmolol for ventricular rate control (unblinded). Loading and infusion rates were
      adjusted to achieve equivalent degrees of ventricular rate control. RESULTS:
      Patients were similar with regard to age and Apache III score. Most patients in
      both groups had atrial fibrillation (esmolol, 79%; diltiazem, 81%), and none
      experienced stable conversion with adenosine. Patients randomized to receive
      esmolol experienced a 59% rate of conversion to sinus rhythm within 2 h of
      treatment, compared with only 33% for patients randomized to receive diltiazem
      (intention to treat, P = 0.049; odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.046
      to 7.8). After 12 h of therapy, the number of patients converting to sinus rhythm
      increased in both groups (esmolol, 85%; diltiazem, 62%), and the rates of
      conversion no longer differed significantly. Ventricular rates when
      supraventricular tachyarrhythmia began and after 2 and 12 h of rate control
      therapy were similar in the two treatment groups. The in-hospital mortality rate 
      and length of stay in the intensive care unit were not significantly influenced
      by treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Among adenosine-resistant patients in the
      intensive care unit with atrial fibrillation after noncardiac surgery,
      intravenous esmolol produced a more rapid (2-h) conversion to sinus rhythm than
      did intravenous diltiazem.

TI  - Intensive medical therapy versus coronary angioplasty for suppression of
      myocardial ischemia in survivors of acute myocardial infarction: a prospective,
      randomized pilot study.
PG  - 2017-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients who have inducible ischemia after acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI) generally undergo coronary angiography with the intent to
      revascularize. Whether this approach is superior to intensive treatment with
      anti-ischemic medications is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a
      prospective, randomized pilot study comparing intensive medical therapy with
      coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for suppression of myocardial ischemia in 44 stable
      survivors of AMI. Myocardial ischemia was quantified with adenosine 201Tl
      tomography (SPECT) performed 4.5+/-2.9 days after AMI. All patients at baseline
      had a large total (>/=20%) and ischemic (>/=10%) left ventricular perfusion
      defect size (PDS). SPECT was repeated at 43+/-26 days after therapy was
      optimized. The total stress-induced PDS was comparably reduced with medical
      therapy (from 38+/-13% to 26+/-16%; P<0.0001) and PTCA (from 35+/-12% to
      20+/-16%; P<0.0001). The reduction in ischemic PDS was also similar (P=NS) in
      both groups. Cardiac events occurred in 7 of 44 patients over 12+/-5 months.
      Patients who remained clinically stable had a greater reduction in ischemic PDS
      (-13+/-9%) than those who had a recurrent cardiac event (-5+/-7%; P<0.02).
      Event-free survival was superior in the 24 patients who had a significant (>/=9%)
      reduction in PDS (96%) compared with those who did not (65%; P=0.009).
      CONCLUSIONS: In this small pilot study, intensive medical therapy and PTCA were
      comparable at suppressing ischemia in stable patients after AMI. Sequential
      imaging with adenosine SPECT can track changes in PDS after anti-ischemic
      therapies and thereby predict subsequent outcome. Corroboration of these
      preliminary findings in a larger cardiac-event trial is warranted.

TI  - Frequency of hospitalization after exposure to known drug-drug interactions in a 
      Medicaid population.
PG  - 1112-20
AB  - A matched-pair case-control analysis of Medicaid claims was performed to
      determine the risks of hospitalization associated with drug-drug interactions.
      Patients were hospitalized and controls were not. They were randomly matched
      based on contemporaneous eligibility for Medicaid benefits. Odds ratios for
      hospitalization in patients exposed to known drug-drug interactions were compared
      with those in patients exposed to one of the interacting agents. When confidence 
      intervals did not overlap, the odds ratio was considered to be significantly
      increased. Odds ratios were significantly increased for many interacting drug
      pairs, and were associated with commonly recognized interactions as well as less 
      widely recognized ones. Cimetidine interactions achieved significance only with
      theophylline. In the Medicaid population, exposure to a number of drug-drug
      interactions was associated with a significantly increased risk of
      hospitalization.

TI  - Long-term follow-up after early intervention with intravenous diltiazem or
      intravenous nitroglycerin for unstable angina pectoris.
PG  - 1208-13
AB  - AIMS: In a double-blind randomized trial in unstable angina it was shown that
      intravenous diltiazem reduced ischaemic events in the first 48 h after inclusion 
      better than intravenous nitroglycerin. The present study was performed to
      establish the long-term prognosis of the randomized patients, with respect to
      their initial treatment assignment. METHODS AND RESULTS: One year follow-up data 
      on ischaemic end-points and anti-ischaemic medication were recorded. Results were
      available for all of the 121 randomized patients. One hundred and sixty-seven
      primary endpoint events were recorded, of which 54 occurred in the first 48 h and
      113 during the follow-up. Survival analysis showed that event-free survival was
      significantly better in the diltiazem group (45.0%) than in the nitroglycerin
      group (34.4%), P=0.04. The incidence rate after 48 h and one year for cardiac
      death are, respectively, 0% and 4.1%. The trend in anti-ischaemic medication was 
      higher in the nitroglycerin group. For beta-blockers, this trend became
      significant after 12 months (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: These results show that the
      initial benefit obtained by early treatment with intravenous diltiazem was
      preserved during the first year after the initial hospitalization, and that,
      despite the high risk of cardiac events in our population, the overall mortality 
      12 months after inclusion was low.

TI  - Efficacy of atenolol and captopril in reducing risk of macrovascular and
      microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes: UKPDS 39. UK Prospective Diabetes
      Study Group.
PG  - 713-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tight control of blood pressure with either a
      beta blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor has a specific
      advantage or disadvantage in preventing the macrovascular and microvascular
      complications of type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial comparing
      an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) with a beta blocker
      (atenolol) in patients with type 2 diabetes aiming at a blood pressure of
      <150/<85 mm Hg. SETTING: 20 hospital based clinics in England, Scotland, and
      Northern Ireland. SUBJECTS: 1148 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (mean
      age 56 years, mean blood pressure 160/94 mm Hg). Of the 758 patients allocated to
      tight control of blood pressure, 400 were allocated to captopril and 358 to
      atenolol. 390 patients were allocated to less tight control of blood pressure.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predefined clinical end points, fatal and non-fatal,
      related to diabetes, death related to diabetes, and all cause mortality.
      Surrogate measures of microvascular and macrovascular disease included urinary
      albumin excretion and retinopathy assessed by retinal photography. RESULTS:
      Captopril and atenolol were equally effective in reducing blood pressure to a
      mean of 144/83 mm Hg and 143/81 mm Hg respectively, with a similar proportion of 
      patients (27% and 31%) requiring three or more antihypertensive treatments. More 
      patients in the captopril group than the atenolol group took the allocated
      treatment: at their last clinic visit, 78% of those allocated captopril and 65%
      of those allocated atenolol were taking the drug (P<0.0001). Captopril and
      atenolol were equally effective in reducing the risk of macrovascular end points.
      Similar proportions of patients in the two groups showed deterioration in
      retinopathy by two grades after nine years (31% in the captopril group and 37% in
      the atenolol group) and developed clinical grade albuminuria >=300 mg/l (5% and
      9%). The proportion of patients with hypoglycaemic attacks was not different
      between groups, but mean weight gain in the atenolol group was greater (3.4 kg v 
      1.6 kg). CONCLUSION: Blood pressure lowering with captopril or atenolol was
      similarly effective in reducing the incidence of diabetic complications. This
      study provided no evidence that either drug has any specific beneficial or
      deleterious effect, suggesting that blood pressure reduction in itself may be
      more important than the treatment used.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tight control of blood pressure prevents
      macrovascular and microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.
      DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial comparing tight control of blood pressure
      aiming at a blood pressure of <150/85 mm Hg (with the use of an angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or a beta blocker atenolol as main
      treatment) with less tight control aiming at a blood pressure of <180/105 mm Hg. 
      SETTING: 20 hospital based clinics in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
      SUBJECTS: 1148 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 56, mean
      blood pressure at entry 160/94 mm Hg); 758 patients were allocated to tight
      control of blood pressure and 390 patients to less tight control with a median
      follow up of 8.4 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predefined clinical end points,
      fatal and non-fatal, related to diabetes, deaths related to diabetes, and all
      cause mortality. Surrogate measures of microvascular disease included urinary
      albumin excretion and retinal photography. RESULTS: Mean blood pressure during
      follow up was significantly reduced in the group assigned tight blood pressure
      control (144/82 mm Hg) compared with the group assigned to less tight control
      (154/87 mm Hg) (P<0.0001). Reductions in risk in the group assigned to tight
      control compared with that assigned to less tight control were 24% in diabetes
      related end points (95% confidence interval 8% to 38%) (P=0.0046), 32% in deaths 
      related to diabetes (6% to 51%) (P=0.019), 44% in strokes (11% to 65%) (P=0.013),
      and 37% in microvascular end points (11% to 56%) (P=0.0092), predominantly owing 
      to a reduced risk of retinal photocoagulation. There was a non-significant
      reduction in all cause mortality. After nine years of follow up the group
      assigned to tight blood pressure control also had a 34% reduction in risk in the 
      proportion of patients with deterioration of retinopathy by two steps (99%
      confidence interval 11% to 50%) (P=0.0004) and a 47% reduced risk (7% to 70%)
      (P=0.004) of deterioration in visual acuity by three lines of the early treatment
      of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart. After nine years of follow up 29% of
      patients in the group assigned to tight control required three or more treatments
      to lower blood pressure to achieve target blood pressures. CONCLUSION: Tight
      blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes achieves
      a clinically important reduction in the risk of deaths related to diabetes,
      complications related to diabetes, progression of diabetic retinopathy, and
      deterioration in visual acuity.

TI  - Randomized, double-blind crossover study to investigate the effects of amlodipine
      and isosorbide mononitrate on the time course and severity of exercise-induced
      myocardial stunning.
PG  - 749-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myocardial stunning may cause prolonged left ventricular dysfunction 
      after exercise-induced ischemia that can be attenuated by calcium antagonists in 
      animal models. To assess their effects in humans, we performed a randomized,
      double-blind crossover study comparing the calcium antagonist amlodipine (10 mg
      once daily) versus isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN, 50 mg once daily) on
      postexercise stunning. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-four men with chronic stable
      angina and normal left ventricular function underwent serial quantitative
      exercise stress echocardiography after 3 weeks on each treatment to assess the
      degree of postexercise stunning with simultaneous sestamibi single-photon
      emission computed tomography perfusion scans at peak stress to quantify the
      ischemic burden. Exercise time (P=1), maximum ST depression (P=0.48), and
      sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography scores (P=0.17) were
      unchanged between treatments. Stunning occurred more often with ISMN than
      amlodipine (82% versus 48%). The global and segmental stress echocardiography
      parameters of stunning were attenuated in patients while taking amlodipine
      compared with ISMN. Shortening fractions and ejection fractions were less
      impaired 30 minutes after exercise in patients receiving amlodipine (3.5+/-1.4%
      versus 2.5+/-1.4%, P=0.014, and 59.7+/-5.4% versus 54.5+/-8%, P<0.001);
      similarly, the isovolumic relaxation period was less prolonged with amlodipine
      (93+/-15.5 versus 106.3+/-14.9 ms, P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Despite comparable
      levels of ischemia, amlodipine attenuated stunning when compared with ISMN. This 
      beneficial effect may relate to a prevention of the calcium overload implicated
      in the pathogenesis of stunning.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers attenuate cardiovascular responses to tracheal
      extubation in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 655-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Hypertensive patients exhibit exaggerated cardiovascular responses to
      tracheal extubation. This study was undertaken to examine the inhibitory effects 
      of calcium channel blockers, nicardipine and diltiazem, on haemodynamic changes
      after tracheal extubation. METHODS: Sixty hypertensive patients (ASA physical
      status II) undergoing elective orthopaedic (upper and lower extremity) surgery
      received, in a randomized, double-blind manner, 30 micrograms.kg-1 nicardipine,
      0.2 mg.kg-1 diltiazem or saline (as a control) (n = 20 of each) i.v. before
      tracheal extubation. Changes in heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and
      rate-pressure product (RPP) were measured before and after tracheal extubation.
      RESULTS: The HR, MAP and RPP increased after tracheal extubation in the control
      group (P < 0.05). The increases in these haemodynamic variables were attenuated
      with nicardipine or diltiazem. The inhibitory effects of diltiazem on these
      cardiovascular responses to tracheal extubation were greater than those of
      nicardipine (HR; 86 +/- 7 vs 101 +/- 10, RPP; 11,437 +/- 1,575 vs 14,675 +/-
      2,874, mean +/- SD, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with nicardipine,
      administration of diltiazem produced greater attenuating the circulatory
      responses to tracheal extubation in hypertensive patients.

TI  - Comparison of 24-hour blood pressure, heart rate, and autonomic nerve activity in
      hypertensive patients treated with cilnidipine or nifedipine retard.
PG  - 331-6
AB  - We compared the effects of cilnidipine and nifedipine retard on 24-h blood
      pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and autonomic nerve activity in patients with
      essential hypertension. Cilnidipine is a novel and unique 1,4-dihydropyridine
      calcium antagonist that has the L-type and N-type voltage-dependent calcium
      channel-blocking action. Fourteen hypertensive outpatients (four men and 10
      women; aged 64 +/- 2 years, mean +/- SEM) were enrolled in this study. Their
      ambulatory BP and electrocardiogram were monitored for 24 h at intervals of 30
      min with a portable recorder after a 4-week drug-free period, after a 4-week
      treatment period with cilnidipine (5 or 10 mg once daily), and after a 4-week
      treatment period with nifedipine retard (10 or 20 mg twice daily). The order of
      the three periods was randomized. Autonomic nerve activity was evaluated by a
      power spectral analysis of HR variability, by using the high-frequency (HF)
      component as an index of parasympathetic nerve activity and the ratio of the
      low-frequency (LF) component to the HF component (LF/HF) as an index of
      sympathovagal balance. Cilnidipine and nifedipine retard significantly reduced
      the 24-h BP of these patients to similar extents (cilnidipine, -11 +/- 3/-6 +/- 1
      mm Hg; nifedipine retard, -15 +/- 3/-6 +/- 2 mm Hg). Cilnidipine did not change
      the 24-h average HR, whereas nifedipine retard significantly increased it (+3.3
      +/- 1.4 beats/min; p < 0.05). Nifedipine retard significantly increased the LF/HF
      ratio in the daytime and the nighttime. Such changes were limited to the daytime 
      in the treatment period with cilnidipine. These results suggest that cilnidipine 
      is effective as a once-daily antihypertensive agent and had less influence on
      autonomic nervous system and HR than did nifedipine retard.

TI  - A comparison of the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of felodipine IV and
      nifedipine IV in patients with hypertensive crisis or emergency not responding to
      oral nifedipine.
PG  - 295-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A clinical definition of a hypertensive emergency is excessively high 
      blood pressure in the presence of symptoms indicating end organ damage. Equally
      high blood pressure without symptoms is called a hypertensive crisis. Patients
      with hypertensive crisis or emergency need prompt, effective, and specific
      therapy and a controlled reduction of blood pressure. METHODS: We performed a
      randomized, double-blind multi-centre study, to compare the safety, efficacy and 
      tolerability of an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of two dihydropyridine calcium
      channel blockers (either nifedipine or felodipine) in 122 patients, of whom 63
      were diagnosed as hypertensive emergencies and 59 as hypertensive crisis, who had
      not reacted adequately (diastolic blood pressure <115 mmHg) to 5 mg of nifedipine
      PO. RESULTS: Both drugs lowered blood pressure adequately in more than 90% of the
      patients and were well tolerated. Only one patient had to be withdrawn, because
      of an excessive decrease in blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Patients with excessively
      high blood pressure who do not react to oral nifedipine can be treated equally
      effectively with felodipine and nifedipine IV. Felodipine is easier to handle
      because of its lack of light sensitivity.

TI  - Withdrawal effects of antianginal therapy: comparison of isosorbide dinitrate and
      nifedipine.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - We compared the effects of abrupt cessation of nifedipine and isosorbide
      dinitrate therapy in patients with stable angina pectoris. Eighteen males were
      studied. Each patient received isosorbide dinitrate and nifedipine continuously
      for 5 weeks by randomised cross-over technique. Exercise treadmill tests were
      performed before each treatment period, at the beginning of treatment, 4 weeks
      after initiation of treatment and on the first and eighth days of drug
      withdrawal. At the end of treatment the antianginal effect of both agents
      attenuated (versus acute administration). Abrupt cessation of isosorbide
      dinitrate caused only a tendency towards decrease in exercise tolerance versus
      pre-treatment level. Alternatively, abrupt cessation of nifedipine resulted in
      substantial deterioration in exercise tolerance, which was statistically
      significant 21 and 24 h after the last dose administration. The number of anginal
      attacks increased >25% in two patients after cessation of isosorbide dinitrate
      and in eight patients after cessation of nifedipine. In no patient rest angina
      episodes appeared after stopping of isosorbide dinitrate, however, after stopping
      of nifedipine rest angina episodes appeared in three patients. We conclude that
      withdrawal phenomenon of nifedipine is much more pronounced than that of
      isosorbide dinitrate and may emerge on the first day of drug cessation. Such a
      phenomenon may be evident even in patients in whom nifedipine effect have
      attenuated due to the development of tolerance.

TI  - Distinct vasodilation, without reflex neurohormonal activation, induced by
      barnidipine in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 9-14
AB  - Barnidipine is a new 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a strong and
      long-lasting vasodilatory effect. In order to assess the haemodynamic profile of 
      the antihypertensive effect of barnidipine, a randomized, double-blind study of
      barnidipine vs nitrendipine was performed in 24 patients with mild to moderate
      essential hypertension. Following an initial 4-week placebo period, patients
      whose sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) was between 95 and 114 mm Hg, and 
      whose sitting systolic blood pressure was between 150 and 219 mm Hg, were
      randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either barnidipine (10 mg) or nitrendipine (10 
      mg) once daily, for a 6-week double-blind period. Subsequently, patients with an 
      SiDBP of less than 90 mm Hg continued for a second 6-week period with the same
      monotherapy, while patients with an SiDBP of 90 mm Hg or above received double
      the dose of antihypertensive treatment for the next 6 weeks. Two-dimensional M-
      and B-mode echocardiography with Doppler flowmetry was performed at the end of
      both the placebo and active treatment phases. Barnidipine and nitrendipine
      reduced blood pressure by the same degree (barnidipine: from 165 +/- 2/100 +/- 1 
      to 145 +/- 2/89 +/- 1 mm Hg, p < 0.01; nitrendipine: from 163 +/- 3/100 +/- 2 to 
      143 +/- 7/90 +/- 3 mm Hg, p < 0.01) as a result of peripheral vasodilation. This 
      was not accompanied by reflex neurohormonal activation. Moreover, only in the
      group receiving barnidipine was a significant decrease in plasma noradrenaline
      observed, both when the patients were in the supine position (from 298 +/- 27 to 
      214 +/- 21 pg/ml, p < 0.05) and when they were upright (from 472 +/- 37 to 348
      +/- 38 pg/ml, p < 0.05).

TI  - Effects of intensive blood-pressure lowering and low-dose aspirin in patients
      with hypertension: principal results of the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) 
      randomised trial. HOT Study Group.
PG  - 1755-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite treatment, there is often a higher incidence of
      cardiovascular complications in patients with hypertension than in normotensive
      individuals. Inadequate reduction of their blood pressure is a likely cause, but 
      the optimum target blood pressure is not known. The impact of acetylsalicylic
      acid (aspirin) has never been investigated in patients with hypertension. We
      aimed to assess the optimum target diastolic blood pressure and the potential
      benefit of a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid in the treatment of hypertension.
      METHODS: 18790 patients, from 26 countries, aged 50-80 years (mean 61.5 years)
      with hypertension and diastolic blood pressure between 100 mm Hg and 115 mm Hg
      (mean 105 mm Hg) were randomly assigned a target diastolic blood pressure. 6264
      patients were allocated to the target pressure < or =90 mm Hg, 6264 to < or =85
      mm Hg, and 6262 to < or =80 mm Hg. Felodipine was given as baseline therapy with 
      the addition of other agents, according to a five-step regimen. In addition, 9399
      patients were randomly assigned 75 mg/day acetylsalicylic acid (Bamycor, Astra)
      and 9391 patients were assigned placebo. FINDINGS: Diastolic blood pressure was
      reduced by 20.3 mm Hg, 22.3 mm Hg, and 24.3 mm Hg, in the < or =90 mm Hg, < or
      =85 mm Hg, and < or =80 mm Hg target groups, respectively. The lowest incidence
      of major cardiovascular events occurred at a mean achieved diastolic blood
      pressure of 82.6 mm Hg; the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality occurred at
      86.5 mm Hg. Further reduction below these blood pressures was safe. In patients
      with diabetes mellitus there was a 51% reduction in major cardiovascular events
      in target group < or =80 mm Hg compared with target group < or =90 mm Hg (p for
      trend=0.005). Acetylsalicylic acid reduced major cardiovascular events by 15%
      (p=0.03) and all myocardial infarction by 36% (p=0.002), with no effect on
      stroke. There were seven fatal bleeds in the acetylsalicylic acid group and eight
      in the placebo group, and 129 versus 70 non-fatal major bleeds in the two groups,
      respectively (p<0.001). INTERPRETATION: Intensive lowering of blood pressure in
      patients with hypertension was associated with a low rate of cardiovascular
      events. The HOT Study shows the benefits of lowering the diastolic blood pressure
      down to 82.6 mm Hg. Acetylsalicylic acid significantly reduced major
      cardiovascular events with the greatest benefit seen in all myocardial
      infarction. There was no effect on the incidence of stroke or fatal bleeds, but
      non-fatal major bleeds were twice as common.

TI  - Replacing short-acting nifedipine with alternative medications at a large health 
      maintenance organization.
PG  - 471-7
AB  - In response to recent evidence about the safety of calcium channel blockers,
      Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (GHC), a large health maintenance
      organization, implemented a plan in April 1996 to reevaluate the medications of
      1349 patients who were taking short-acting nifedipine. Following the
      intervention, 79.8% of patients taking short-acting nifedipine discontinued use, 
      and 45.6% switched to once-daily felodipine. By presenting physicians and
      patients with recent evidence about the safety of short-acting nifedipine, a
      large health maintenance organization was able to motivate broad-scale changes to
      safer alternative drug therapies.

PG  - 41-8
AB  - In order to assess additional anti-ischaemic effects of amlodipine (AML) on
      coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with beta-blockers, 32 patients with CAD,
      verified on angiograms, and stable angina were randomized to receive 5 mg/day of 
      AML or placebo, increasing to 10 mg/day after 2 weeks. Baseline recording of 24-h
      ambulatory ECG and blood pressure, echocardiography and bicycle exercise test was
      repeated after treatment for 2 weeks and for 6 weeks. Reduction of ambulatory
      ischaemia was not significantly greater with AML than with placebo. In exercise
      tests the time to 0.1 mV ST segment depression and the total exercise time
      remained unaltered. Blood pressure was reduced by 10 mg AML. The total
      variability and the very low frequency component of heart rate were reduced after
      both doses. The clinical significance of the possible unfavourable change in
      autonomic modulation of the heart in CAD patients is not known.

      pectoris.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - The antianginal efficacy of 240 mg sustained release verapamil once daily doses
      and 300 mg diltiazem was studied in 20 normotensive patients with chronic stable 
      angina pectoris, using a randomized, double-blind crossover design. Patients
      received a blinded therapy of verapamil placebo and diltiazem placebo for six
      weeks than only sustained-release diltiazem (SRD) for a long-term phase of three 
      weeks, after a two-week placebo baseline period. Symptom-limited bicycle exercise
      was longer with the verapamil (510+/-129.9 s) and diltiazem (540+/-124.6 s) than 
      with placebo at baseline (396+/-152.2 s, P<0.005). Verapamil and diltiazem
      reduced the weekly rate of anginal attacks from 5.1+/-8.6 during placebo to
      4.4+/-4.1 with verapamil and 1.9+/-3.2 with diltiazem (P<0.05). The antianginal
      effects of the two agents are probably mediated by reduction of myocardial oxygen
      demand at submaximal exercise. In addition, diltiazem appears to provide more
      symptomatic relief and reduces the weekly number of anginal attacks significantly
      more than verapamil. Therefore its once-daily administration simplifies the
      treatment schedule and should improve patients' compliance.

TI  - Comparative antihypertensive effectiveness of once-daily mibefradil and diltiazem
      CD. Mibefradil Hypertension Study Group.
PG  - 954-62
AB  - This multicenter, double-masked, randomized, forced-titration, parallel-group
      trial was designed to determine whether we could confirm the results of a
      previous trial that demonstrated a significantly greater antihypertensive effect 
      for mibefradil compared with diltiazem CD. Two hundred thirty-nine patients with 
      uncomplicated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension and a baseline sitting
      diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) between 95 and 114 mm Hg were randomized to
      receive once-daily treatment with mibefradil 50 mg (n = 119) or diltiazem CD 180 
      mg (n = 120). After 4 weeks of treatment, all patients underwent forced titration
      to mibefradil 100 mg or diltiazem CD 360 mg for an additional 8 weeks. After 12
      weeks of active treatment, the mean reduction from baseline in trough SDBP was
      significantly greater with mibefradil than with diltiazem CD (-14.3 +/- 6.6 mm Hg
      vs -11.7 +/- 7.4 mm Hg, respectively). In addition, significantly more patients
      receiving mibefradil had a decrease in SDBP > or = 10 mm Hg or a decrease to < or
      = 90 mm Hg by week 12 than did patients receiving diltiazem CD (82% vs 72%,
      respectively). The tolerability of mibefradil and diltiazem CD were comparable,
      with similar percentages of patients in both groups reporting at least one
      adverse event (21% vs 22%, respectively) that was considered to be at least
      remotely related to the study drug. The results of this study confirm those of
      the previous trial. Once-daily treatment with mibefradil 100 mg is significantly 
      more effective than diltiazem CD 360 mg in lowering both diastolic and systolic
      blood pressure. Both drugs are well tolerated.

TI  - Clinical results of the Verapamil inHypertension and Atherosclerosis Study. VHAS 
      Investigators.
PG  - 1337-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Verapamil in Hypertension and Atherosclerosis Study (VHAS) is a
      prospective randomized study the objective of which was to compare the long-term 
      effects of verapamil and chlorthalidone on the blood pressure, clinical safety,
      and the progression/regression of carotid wall lesions in members of a large
      population of hypertensive patients. DESIGN: After a 3-week placebo run-in
      period, 1414 hypertensive patients [692 men and 722 women, aged 53.2 +/- 7 years,
      blood pressure 168.9 +/- 10.5/ 102.2 +/- 5.0 mmHg (means +/- SD)] were assigned
      randomly to be administered either 240 mg sustained-release verapamil (n = 707)
      or 25 mg chlorthalidone (n = 707) once a day for 2 years. The study design was
      double blind for the first 6 months and open thereafter. 25-50 mg/day captopril
      were added to the treatment of non-responding patients; subsequently, patients
      not responding to combined therapy were switched to any therapy chosen by the
      treating doctors (free therapy). The blood pressure of the sitting subject, heart
      rate, and a standard clinical safety profile (electrocardiogram, laboratory
      tests, adverse events, cardiovascular events, and deaths) were assessed regularly
      throughout the study. RESULTS: After 2 years the systolic and diastolic blood
      pressures were reduced significantly in members of both treatment groups (by
      16.3/16.6% with verapamil and by 16.9/16.2% with chlorthalidone, both by analysis
      of variance, P < 0.0001). The patients for whom we added captopril treatment
      constituted 22.6% of the verapamil and 26.2% of the chlorthalidone group; while
      11.6 and 12.2% of patients in these groups, respectively, were administered free 
      therapy. Normalization of the diastolic blood pressure (to < or = 90 mmHg or to <
      or = 95 mmHg with a > or = 10% decrease) was achieved for 69.3% of the verapamil 
      and 66.9% of the chlorthalidone group. A decrease in heart rate (by 5.8%)
      occurred in members of the verapamil group only. A decrease in total serum
      cholesterol (from 223.6 to 216.9 mg/dl, P < 0.01) and in the total cholesterol:
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (from 4.9 to 4.5, P < 0.01) was noted 
      for the verapamil group only, whereas significantly greater rates of
      hyperuricemia (plasma urate > 7.0 mg/dl; 10.8 versus 3.9%) and hypokalemia (serum
      K < 3.5 mmol/l; 24.6 versus 4.4%) were observed for the chlorthalidone group (P <
      0.01, versus verapamil for both). Adverse events were reported by 32.5% of
      patients treated with verapamil and by 33.4% of those treated with
      chlorthalidone. The most frequent adverse events were constipation in members of 
      the verapamil group (13.7%) and asthenia in members of the chlorthalidone group
      (8.5%). In total 315 dropped out (153 from the verapamil and 162 from the
      chlorthalidone group). The occurrence of cardiovascular events was similar for
      both treatments (42 events for verapamil and 43 for chlorthalidone, NS).
      CONCLUSION: Similar antihypertensive efficacies, tolerabilities and
      cardiovascular event rates were observed with verapamil and with chlorthalidone. 
      However, treatment with chlorthalidone was associated with significantly higher
      incidences of hyperuricemia and hypokalemia than was treatment with verapamil.

PG  - 353-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antianginal efficacy and possible adverse haemodynamic
      effects of combination treatment with trimetazidine and diltiazem in patients
      with stable angina. DESIGN: Double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial of
      four weeks duration. SETTING: Outpatient department of two Indian hospitals.
      SUBJECTS: 64 male patients with stable angina, uncontrolled on diltiazem alone.
      INTERVENTIONS: Diltiazem 180 mg and trimetazidine 60 mg, or diltiazem 180 mg and 
      placebo daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Change in exercise time to 1 mm ST segment
      depression. RESULTS: 33 patients (55%) had no exercise induced angina at 3 mm ST 
      segment depression at inclusion in the study (silent ischaemia). Intention to
      treat analysis showed that of 32 patients in each treatment group, the number (%)
      of patients responding to trimetazidine compared to placebo was: for anginal
      attacks, 28 (87.5) v 15 (46.9), p < 0.001; for exercise time to 1 mm ST segment
      depression, 21 (65.6) v 9 (28.1), p < 0.003; for exercise time to angina, 12
      (37.5) v 5 (15.6), p < 0.05; and for maximum work at peak exercise, 17 (53.1) v 8
      (25), p < 0.02. Compared to placebo, there was net improvement with trimetazidine
      in mean anginal attacks of 4.8/ week (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5 to 2.1; p 
      < 0.002); in mean exercise times at 1 mm ST segment depression of 94.2 seconds
      (95% CI 182.8 to 5.6; p < 0.05), and at onset of angina of 113.1 seconds (95% CI 
      181.6 to 44.6; p < 0.02); and in mean maximum work at peak exercise of 1.4
      metabolic equivalents (95% CI 2.4 to 0.3; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      stable angina uncontrolled with diltiazem had a clinically important improvement 
      after combination treatment with trimetazidine, without adverse haemodynamic
      events or increased side effects.

TI  - Addition of felodipine to metoprolol vs replacement of metoprolol by felodipine
      in patients with angina pectoris despite adequate beta-blockade. Results of the
      Felodipine ER and Metoprolol CR in Angina (FEMINA) Study. Working Group on
      Cardiovascular Research, The Netherlands (WCN).
PG  - 1755-64
AB  - AIMS: The study aimed to compare the addition of felodipine to metoprolol, and of
      the replacement of metoprolol by felodipine, with continuation of metoprolol, in 
      patients with angina pectoris despite optimal beta-blockade. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      The study was double-blind, parallel, randomized and controlled, and comprised
      363 patients from 27 outpatient cardiology clinics in the Netherlands. The
      patients had angina and positive bicycle exercise tests despite optimal
      beta-blockade (resting heart rate < 65 beats.min-1). Randomization was to three
      treatment groups: continuation of metoprolol (control), addition of felodipine to
      metoprolol, and replacement of metoprolol by felodipine. Exercise tests were
      repeated after 2 and 5 weeks. The main outcome measure was: exercise result after
      5 weeks, compared with baseline, between-group comparison of changes vs control. 
      There were no significant differences in exercise duration and onset of chest
      pain vs control. The addition of felodipine increased time until 1 mm ST
      depression (43 s, 95% confidence interval 20-65 s), and decreased both ST
      depression at highest comparable work load (0.46 mm, 95% confidence interval
      0.19-0.72), and maximal ST depression (0.49 mm, 95% confidence interval
      0.23-0.74). Exercise results after replacement of metoprolol by felodipine were
      not different from control, apart from a significant increase in rate pressure
      product. Significantly more patients experienced adverse events in the felodipine
      monotherapy group. CONCLUSION: Combination of metoprolol and felodipine is to be 
      preferred to felodipine monotherapy in patients who have signs and symptoms of
      myocardial ischaemia despite optimal beta-blockade.

TI  - Prognostic significance of myocardial ischemia detected by ambulatory
      electrocardiography, exercise treadmill testing, and electrocardiogram at rest to
      predict cardiac events by one year (the Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot
      [ACIP] study)
PG  - 1395-401
AB  - Myocardial ischemia identified by ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG),
      exercising treadmill testing, (ETT), or 12-lead electrocardiogram at rest is
      associated with an adverse prognosis, but the effect of improving these ischemic 
      manifestations by treatment on outcome is unknown. The Asymptomatic Cardiac
      Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) study was a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
      funded study to determine the feasibility of conducting a large-scale prognosis
      study and to assess the effect of 3 treatment strategies (angina-guided strategy,
      AECG ischemia-guided strategy, and revascularization strategy) in reducing the
      manifestations of ischemia as indicated by AECG and ETT. The study cohort for
      this database study consisted of 496 randomized patients who performed the AECG, 
      ETT, and 12-lead electrocardiogram at rest at both the qualifying and week 12
      visits. The effect of modifying ischemia by treatment on the incidence of cardiac
      events (death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, or
      hospitalization for an ischemic event) at 1 year was examined. In the 2 medical
      treatment groups (n = 328) there was an association between the number of
      ambulatory electrocardiographic ischemic episodes at the qualifying visit and
      combined cardiac events at 1 year (p = 0.003). In the AECG ischemia-guided
      patients there was a trend associating greater reduction in the number of
      ambulatory electrocardiographic ischemia episodes with a reduced incidence of
      combined cardiac events (r = -0.15, p = 0.06). In the revascularization strategy 
      patients this association was absent. In the medical treatment patients the
      exercise duration on the baseline ETT was inversely associated with an adverse
      prognosis (p = 0.02). The medical treatment strategies only slightly improved the
      exercise time and the exercise duration remained of prognostic significance. In
      the revascularization group strategy patients this association was absent. Thus, 
      myocardial ischemia detected by AECG and an abnormal ETT are each independently
      associated with an adverse cardiac outcome in patients subsequently treated
      medically.

TI  - Comparison of intravenous diltiazem and verapamil for the acute treatment of
      atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
PG  - 1238-45
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous diltiazem and
      verapamil in controlling ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or
      flutter, and to evaluate the effects of these agents on left ventricular systolic
      function. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study.
      SETTING: University-affiliated hospital and Veterans Administration hospital.
      PATIENTS: Seventeen men with atrial fibrillation or flutter with a ventricular
      rate of 120 beats/minute or higher and a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or 
      greater. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received up to two intravenous boluses of either
      diltiazem or verapamil, followed by an 8-hour continuous infusion if a
      therapeutic response was achieved (phase I). After a washout period, patients who
      responded were crossed over to receive the other drug in a similar fashion (phase
      II). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the end of each infusion, the patient's
      ejection fraction was assessed by gated angiography. Of the 17 men initially
      randomized, 8 successfully completed both phases I and II. In these patients,
      baseline mean (+/- SD) ventricular rates before treatment with intravenous
      diltiazem and verapamil were 138 +/- 15 and 132 +/- 9 beats/minute, respectively 
      (NS). At 2 minutes after the initial bolus dose, the mean ventricular rate
      decreased to 100 +/- 13 beats/minute in the diltiazem group compared with 114 +/-
      17 beats/minute in those receiving verapamil (p < 0.05). Mean ventricular rates
      of 96 +/- 11 and 97 +/- 9 beats/minute were maintained during the 8-hour
      continuous infusion of diltiazem and verapamil, respectively (NS). On completion 
      of the bolus dose(s) and during continuous infusions, there were no significant
      differences in blood pressures between the groups. Mean ejection fractions were
      35.6 +/- 13.6% and 35.5 +/- 15.4% in the diltiazem and verapamil groups,
      respectively (NS). For the 17 patients, the mean maximum percentage decreases in 
      blood pressure were not significantly different between groups. However, three
      patients developed symptomatic hypotension, all of whom were randomized to
      receive verapamil initially. CONCLUSION: Intravenous diltiazem and verapamil are 
      comparable in terms of efficacy and effect on systolic function in patients with 
      rapid atrial fibrillation and flutter. However, hypotension may limit therapy
      with verapamil in some patients.

TI  - The effects of long-term treatment on left ventricular hypertrophy in patients
      with essential hypertension: relation to changes in neurohumoral factors.
PG  - 643-8
AB  - This study compared the effects of 1 year of monotherapy with a calcium-channel
      antagonist (nilvadipine; NIL), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
      (temocapril; TEM), or a new vasodilator (cadralazine; CAD) on left ventricular
      (LV) hypertrophy in essential hypertension. Furthermore, to elucidate the
      mechanism responsible for regression of LV hypertrophy after treatment, LV mass
      index (LVMI) by echocardiography, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PAC),
      norepinephrine, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration were measured 
      before and after treatment. Thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to the
      NIL, TEM, or CAD groups. Blood pressure (BP) before treatment was 174 +/- 10/104 
      +/- 7, 173 +/- 18/103 +/- 8, and 171 +/- 16/103 +/- 7 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) in NIL,
      TEM, and CAD groups, respectively. BP was lower after treatment with each of the 
      three test drugs than after the placebo period, and there were no differences in 
      BP reduction among three groups. LVMI, in NIL and TEM, was reduced from 129 +/-
      48 to 115 +/- 39 g/m2 and from 117 +/- 39 to 88 +/- 20 g/m2 (p < 0.05 and p <
      0.01, respectively), whereas, in the CAD group, it was increased (110 +/- 30 to
      138 +/- 27 g/m2; p < 0.01). In the CAD group, PAC decreased and ANP increased
      significantly. The change in LVMI correlated with that in BP for TEM and with
      that in ANP in all patients. These data indicated that LV volume overload as well
      as LV pressure overload may contribute to LV hypertrophy and that monotherapy
      with CAD is not desirable from the point of view of LV mass reduction in
      essential hypertension.

TI  - Efficacy of mibefradil compared with amlodipine in suppressing exercise-induced
      and daily silent ischemia: results of a multicenter, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 2557-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mibefradil is a new benzimidazolyl-substituted tetraline-derivative
      calcium antagonist. Its vasodilatory activity combined with an ability to lower
      heart rate without negative inotropic effects as well as its long duration of
      action make it a promising anti-ischemic agent. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three
      hundred nine patients with coronary artery disease, stable angina pectoris, and
      positive exercise tests were randomized to receive mibefradil (50, 100, or 150
      mg), amlodipine (10 mg), or placebo. The anti-ischemic effects of mibefradil on
      exercise test and silent ischemia parameters were assessed. At doses of 100 and
      150 mg, mibefradil increased exercise duration (by 55.5 and 51.0 seconds,
      respectively; P<.001 for both), increased time to onset of angina (by 98.3 and
      82.7 seconds, respectively; P<.001), and increased time to 1-mm ST depression (by
      81.7 and 94.3 seconds, respectively; P<.001). By comparison, a 10 mg/d dose of
      amlodipine significantly improved only time to onset of angina (treatment effect:
      38.5 seconds, P=.036). Mibefradil 100 mg and 150 mg decreased the number of
      episodes of silent ischemia (treatment effects: -3.1 and -3.6, respectively;
      P<.001) and the duration of silent ischemia (treatment effects: -9.2 minutes,
      P=.048, and -14.6 minutes, P=.002, respectively). The decrease in the number of
      episodes of silent ischemia was also statistically significant in the group
      receiving 10 mg of amlodipine (-1.5; P=.036). CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily doses of
      100 and 150 mg mibefradil were effective in improving exercise tolerance and
      reducing ischemic episodes during ambulatory monitoring in patients with coronary
      artery disease.

TI  - Effect of morning versus evening dosing of diltiazem on myocardial ischemia
      detected by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in chronic stable angina
      pectoris. Dilacor XR Ambulatory Ischemia Study Group.
PG  - 421-5
AB  - Myocardial ischemia occurs frequently during daily life and has a circadian
      pattern similar to that reported for myocardial infarction and sudden death.
      Because of the increased risk of myocardial ischemia in the morning hours, it has
      been suggested that the administration of anti-ischemic medication before bedtime
      may be more effective than the traditional morning dosing. This randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluated the effects of
      480-mg/day diltiazem (given either in the A.M. or the P.M.) on myocardial
      ischemia using ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in 68 patients with
      chronic stable angina and > or = 2 minutes of ischemia per 48 hours. During
      treatment with diltiazem, the duration and number of myocardial ischemic episodes
      were reduced by 45% (94 to 52 minutes, p <0.004) and by 40% (4.5 to 2.7 episodes,
      p <0.003), respectively. The duration and number of myocardial ischemic episodes 
      during daytime (6 A.M. to 6 P.M.) hours were also reduced by 52% (74 to 36
      minutes, p <0.002) and by 48% (3.1 to 1.6 episodes, p <0.001), respectively.
      There was no significant difference between A.M. and P.M. dosing. Morning
      ischemia (6 A.M. to noon), considered separately from daytime ischemia, was also 
      significantly reduced by both A.M. and P.M. dosing regimens, with no difference
      between the regimens. The results of this study showed that both A.M. and P.M.
      dosing of long-acting diltiazem were equally effective in suppressing episodes of
      ambulatory myocardial ischemia at all times.

TI  - Danish multicenter randomized study of invasive versus conservative treatment in 
      patients with inducible ischemia after thrombolysis in acute myocardial
      infarction (DANAMI). DANish trial in Acute Myocardial Infarction.
PG  - 748-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the DANish trial in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DANAMI)
      study was to compare an invasive strategy of percutaneous transluminal coronary
      angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with a conservative 
      strategy in patients with inducible myocardial ischemia who received thrombolytic
      treatment for a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 
      the 503 patients randomized to an invasive strategy, PTCA was performed in 266
      (52.9%) and CABG in 147 (29.2%) from 2 to 10 weeks after the AMI. Of the 505
      patients in the conservative treatment group, only 8 (1.6%) had been
      revascularized 2 months after the AMI. The patients were followed up from 1 to
      4.5 years. The primary end points were mortality, reinfarction, and admission
      with unstable angina. At 2.4 years' follow-up (median), mortality was 3.6% in the
      invasive treatment group and 4.4% in the conservative treatment group (not
      significant). Invasive treatment was associated with a lower incidence of AMI
      (5.6% versus 10.5%; P=.0038) and a lower incidence of admission for unstable
      angina (17.9% versus 29.5%; P<.00001). The percentages of patients with a primary
      end point were 15.4% and 29.5% at 1 year, 23.5% and 36.6% at 2 years, and 31.7%
      versus 44.0% at 4 years (P=<.00001) in the invasive and conservative treatment
      groups, respectively. At 12 months, stable angina pectoris was present in 21% of 
      patients in the invasive treatment group and 43% in the conservative treatment
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive treatment in post-AMI patients with inducible
      ischemia results in a reduction in the incidence of reinfarction, fewer
      admissions due to unstable angina, and lower prevalence of stable angina. We
      conclude that patients with inducible ischemia before discharge who have received
      treatment with thrombolytic drugs for their first AMI should be referred to
      coronary arteriography and revascularized accordingly.

      Groupe francais de l'etude HOT].
PG  - 1165-8
AB  - The objective of the HOT study, an international, prospective, randomised study
      is to determine the optimal level of the blood pressure under treatment, in
      linked with the lowest cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. The target
      diastolic blood pressure of 80, 85 and 90 mmHg was determined at the
      randomisation. In order to reach the target blood pressure, a strategy of
      treatment was determined: the 1st step was felodipine (a long acting
      dihydropyridine) and the next steps (if the blood pressure reduction is not
      enough) propose the addition of different therapeutic classes and/or the increase
      of each drug doses. The available data after 2 years of the patients follow-up
      allow us to evaluate the incidence of the reported side effects according to the 
      target blood pressure assigned by randomisation and the number of hypertension
      drugs used to reach these targets. The percentage of patients with at least one
      side effect at 12 and 24 months of follow-up are respectively: for the target
      group DBP < or = 90 mmHg: 9.2% versus 6%; for the target group DBP < or = 85
      mmHg: 8% versus 4.4%; for the target group DBP < or = 80 mmHg: 7.9% versus 4.9%. 
      The overall tolerability is not influenced by the target diastolic blood pressure
      but depends on the number of hypertension drugs used. At 24 months, 2.8% of
      patients are under monotherapy; 7% under bitherapy and 9.8% under tritherapy. The
      incidence of the side effects decreases after the 1st year, but slower than
      between the third months and the first year. There is an influence of the region 
      on the incidence of the side effects, the south European countries describing
      more side effects than France or the north European countries. This seems to be
      linked with a perception of the side effects more than with a higher rate. In
      conclusion, these results confirm the possibility to reach a targeted blood
      pressure using a predetermined strategy without increasing dramatically the
      incidence of the side effects.

TI  - Long-term antianginal and antiischemic effects of mibefradil, the novel T-type
      calcium channel blocker: a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized comparison with sustained-release diltiazem.
PG  - 220-8
AB  - This study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of mibefradil to
      sustained-release diltiazem in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. At
      week 12, statistically equivalent mean increases in exercise tolerance test (ETT)
      duration of > 1 minute were observed in both groups. Similar improvements in time
      to onset of angina and time to persistent 1 mm ST-segment depression were also
      observed with both drugs. Large reductions in heart rate, blood pressure, and
      rate-pressure product were observed at each stage of the ETT among patients
      treated with mibefradil. Each drug was associated with at least a 70% reduction
      from baseline in anginal frequency and nitroglycerin consumption. Patients
      maintained on mibefradil during the withdrawal period had significant increases
      in all three ETT variables at week 16 compared with placebo. The effectiveness of
      mibefradil is comparable with sustained-release diltiazem in treating chronic
      stable angina pectoris, although mibefradil provides greater reductions in heart 
      rate and cardiac workload.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers: an evidence-based review.
PG  - 757-66
AB  - Calcium channel blockers are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular
      disease, but their proper therapeutic role is controversial. Nevertheless, drugs 
      from this class have been evaluated in many controlled clinical trials of
      adequate size and duration in different patient populations. Although many
      important questions remain unanswered, these trials have clarified when and how
      these drugs should be used. In general, the benefits of calcium channel blockers 
      in controlling angina and hypertension are much more clearly documented than are 
      their long term effects on harder end-points such as mortality. Such long term
      data are sorely needed, particularly for hypertension. An increased risk with
      dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers has been clearly seen across several
      studies of patients with coronary disease. In coronary patients with heart
      failure, the deleterious effects of nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil outweigh 
      any possible benefit. Long acting formulations and newer calcium channel blockers
      may not share all of the adverse effects of the older drugs of this class;
      however, their long term safety has not yet been documented. An understanding of 
      the limitations of calcium channel blockers, based upon clinical trial evidence, 
      often leads the practitioner to choose a drug from another class, where efficacy 
      has been clearly proven.

PG  - 760-6
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of diltiazem CD 180 mg
      administered once/day in patients with chronic stable angina inadequately
      controlled with P-blockers, long-acting nitrates, or both. DESIGN: Multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. SETTING:
      Medical clinics in the private and academic sectors. PATIENTS: Of 172 patients,
      170 completed the 2-week double-blind treatment period. INTERVENTION: . Patients 
      received either diltiazem CD 180 mg or placebo once/day in combination with
      existing antianginal therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The time to
      termination of exercise tolerance testing, 24 hours after the dose increased
      significantly in the diltiazem CD group (37.2 sec) compared with the placebo
      group (21.3 sec, p=0.0438). Time to onset of angina during exercise testing also 
      increased (57.6 vs 35.0 sec, respectively, p=0.0324), as did time to moderate
      angina (37.5 vs 20.6 sec, respectively, p=0.0354). The rates of total angina
      attacks and of angina attacks on exertion were significantly reduced in the
      diltiazem CD group versus placebo (p<0.05). Significant reductions in systolic
      and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate-blood pressure product measured at
      rest, submaximum exercise, and exercise termination were observed in diltiazem
      CD-treated patients compared with placebo (p<0.05). The frequency of
      treatment-related adverse events was identical in the two groups, 15.1%.
      CONCLUSION: Diltiazem CD 180 mg once/day is an effective, safe, and beneficial
      initial dosage when added to existing antianginal therapy.

TI  - The prognostic significance of angina pectoris experienced during the first month
      following acute myocardial infarction.
PG  - 623-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angina pectoris accompanied by transient ST-segment changes during
      the in-hospital phase of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a well established 
      marker of subsequent cardiac death and reinfarction. HYPOTHESIS: This study was
      undertaken to record the prognostic significance of angina pectoris experienced
      during the first month following discharge from AMI. METHODS: In all, 803
      patients included in the placebo arm of the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trial II 
      were followed up for 18 months in 20 coronary care units in Denmark. The patients
      were randomized to placebo and were still on study treatment 1 month after
      discharge. Of these patients, 311 (39%) reported chest pain during the first
      month following discharge. RESULTS: Patients with angina pectoris had a
      significantly increased risk of reinfarction [hazard 1.71; 95%-confidence limit
      (CL): 1.09, 2.69] and increased mortality risk which, however, only reached
      borderline statistical significance (hazard 1.52; 95%-CL: 0.96, 2.40). When
      patients were subdivided according to both angina pectoris and heart failure,
      those with one or both of these risk markers had significantly increased
      mortality (p 0.03) and reinfarction (p 0.02) rates compared with patients free of
      both angina pectoris and heart failure. CONCLUSION: Patients with postinfarction 
      angina pectoris have a significantly increased morbidity risk.

TI  - Role of cytokines in the mechanism of action of amlodipine: the PRAISE Heart
      Failure Trial. Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation.
PG  - 35-41
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether the beneficial effects of amlodipine
      in heart failure may be mediated by a reduction in tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. We postulated that TNF-alpha and
      IL-6 levels may also have predictive value in patients with congestive heart
      failure (CHF). BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanism for progression of CHF may
      involve cytokine overexpression. The effect of amlodipine on cytokine levels in
      patients with CHF is unknown. METHODS: In the Prospective Randomized Amlodipine
      Survival Evaluation (PRAISE) trial, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to 
      measure plasma levels of TNF-alpha in 92 patients and IL-6 in 62 patients in New 
      York Heart Association functional classes III and IV randomized to receive
      amlodipine (10 mg/day) or placebo. Blood samples were obtained for cytokine
      measurement at baseline and at 8 and 26 weeks after enrollment. RESULTS: The
      baseline amlodipine and placebo groups did not differ in demographics and
      cytokine levels. Mean (+/- SD) plasma levels of TNF-alpha were 5.69 +/- 0.32
      pg/ml, and those of IL-6 were 9.23 +/- 1.26 pg/ml at baseline. These levels were 
      elevated 6 and 10 times, respectively, compared with those of normal subjects (p 
      < 0.001). Levels of TNF-alpha did not change significantly over the 26-week
      period (p = 0.69). However, IL-6 levels were significantly lower at 26 weeks in
      patients treated with amlodipine versus placebo (p = 0.007 by the Wilcoxon
      signed-rank test). An adverse event-CHF or death-occurred more commonly in
      patients with higher IL-6 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Amlodipine lowers plasma IL-6
      levels in patients with CHF. The beneficial effect of amlodipine in CHF may be
      due to a reduction of cytokines such as IL-6.

TI  - Determining the optimum dose for the intravenous administration of nicardipine in
      the treatment of acute heart failure--a multicenter study. The Nicardipine Heart 
      Failure Study Group.
PG  - 367-74
AB  - Nicardipine is a potent arteriolar vasodilator with a negligible negative
      inotropic effect. Although intravenous administration of this drug has been
      reported to be effective in the treatment of heart failure, the optimal dose by
      this route is not clear. This study was designed to determine the optimum dose
      for the intravenous infusion of nicardipine in the treatment of heart failure. In
      Trial 1, nicardipine was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.5 microgram/kg
      per min to 14 patients with acute heart failure. The dose was increased to 1.0
      microgram/kg per min in 13 cases with marked improvement at 2 h. In Trial 2,
      nicardipine was administered in a double-blind manner to 53 patients at 3
      different rates of infusion for 2 h: 1.0 (Group 1, n = 19), 2.0 (Group 2, n =
      15), and 3.0 (Group 3, n = 19) micrograms/kg per min. Neither heart rate nor mean
      right atrial pressure changed in any of the 3 groups. Favorable hemodynamic
      effects were evident in all groups beginning 30 min after the start of infusion, 
      with an increase in cardiac index (control vs 2 h after infusion, L/min per m2)
      (Group 1: 2.2 +/- 0.4 vs 3.1 +/- 0.8, Group 2: 2.2 +/- 0.4 vs 2.9 +/- 0.5, Group 
      3: 2.3 +/- 0.3 vs 3.1 +/- 0.7, all p < 0.01 compared to the control) and a
      decrease in diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (Group 1: 26 +/- 10 vs 19 +/- 7, 
      Group 2: 27 +/- 10 vs 20 +/- 8, Group 3: 26 +/- 7 vs 18 +/- 5 mmHg, all p <
      0.01). The decrease in systolic pressure was greatest in Group 3 (Group 1: 141
      +/- 31 vs 119 +/- 18, Group 2: 149 +/- 25 vs 118 +/- 17, Group 3; 147 +/- 27 vs
      107 +/- 14 mmHg, all p < 0.01 compared to control, and p < 0.05 between Groups 1 
      and 3). The intravenous drip infusion of nicardipine is effective in the
      treatment of heart failure by inducing an increase in cardiac output and a
      decrease in pulmonary artery wedge pressure. The optimal dose in this study was
      1.0 microgram/kg per min.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers for hypertension: dissecting the evidence for adverse
      effects.
PG  - 565-77
AB  - Safety in the drug treatment of hypertension can only be seen in relation to
      efficacy, which has now come to mean not just blood pressure (BP) reduction but
      improvements in hard end points including mortality. Information on safety can
      come from a variety of sources, in an ascending hierarchy, which is as follows:
      case-control studies, cohort studies, randomized control trials (RCTs), and
      metaanalyses based on good RCTs. Only in the case of metaanalyses are definite
      criteria for acceptability established, but evaluation of case-control and cohort
      studies remains subjective. Despite these reserves about the data sources, it is 
      proposed that the case-control study pointing to the risk of acute myocardial
      infarction during therapy with short-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs) can
      be balanced out by another better more recent study, and by a large cohort study 
      from Israel. In a very elderly population, a well-designed cohort study strongly 
      suggests that short-acting nifedipine can be linked to increased mortality and
      that the specific links may be with a high dose and when the initial BP is less
      than 160/90 mm Hg. However, initial BP was only available in an unspecified
      number of patients. The risk of using short-acting verapamil was no more than
      that of beta-blockade. These differences can be attributed at least in part to
      the low catecholamine profile of verapamil and the marked rapid adrenergic
      activation with short-acting nifedipine, which could also explain the adverse
      effects found when this agent is given to patients with acute coronary syndromes.
      During the chronic use of long-acting dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs, most evidence
      suggests that there is little or no catecholamine activation, or in the case of
      amlodipine, even a decrease in plasma catecholamine levels. These differences may
      explain why the expected regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is obtained
      with long- but not short-acting DHPs. At present the results of several large
      randomized controlled trials with long-acting CCBs are awaited. In the meantime, 
      when the decision has been made to use a CCB, the preferential choice is for the 
      use of a non-DHP for hypertension with clinical ischemia or for postinfarct
      hypertension, for a long-acting CCB for the control of left ventricular
      hypertrophy, and for the DHP amlodipine when there is associated depression of
      myocardial function.

TI  - Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) study two-year follow-up: outcomes of 
      patients randomized to initial strategies of medical therapy versus
      revascularization.
PG  - 2037-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with ischemia during stress testing and ambulatory ECG
      monitoring have an increased risk of cardiac events, but it is not known whether 
      their prognosis is improved by more aggressive treatment with anti-ischemic drugs
      or revascularization. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia
      Pilot study randomized 558 such patients who had coronary anatomy suitable for
      revascularization to three treatment strategies: angina-guided drug therapy
      (n=183), angina plus ischemia-guided drug therapy (n=183), or revascularization
      by angioplasty or bypass surgery (n=192). Two years after randomization, the
      total mortality was 6.6% in the angina-guided strategy, 4.4% in the
      ischemia-guided strategy, and 1.1% in the revascularization strategy (P<.02). The
      rate of death or myocardial infarction was 12.1% in the angina-guided strategy,
      8.8% in the ischemia-guided strategy, and 4.7% in the revascularization strategy 
      (P<.04). The rate of death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent cardiac
      hospitalization was 41.8% in the angina-guided strategy, 38.5% in the
      ischemia-guided strategy, and 23.1% in the revascularization strategy (P<.001).
      Pairwise testing revealed significant differences between the revascularization
      and angina-guided strategies for each comparison. CONCLUSIONS: A strategy of
      initial revascularization appears to improve the prognosis of this population
      compared with angina-guided medical therapy. A larger long-term study is needed
      to confirm this benefit and to adequately test the potential of more aggressive
      drug therapy.

      ST-segment depression was 20%, or a variable threshold group if it was higher.
      Efficacy was assessed by comparing the time to 1 mm ST-depression on a bicycle
      ETT after 4 weeks of treatment, adjusting for the baseline value. The adjusted
      means were 7.44 min for nifedipine GITS and 7.68 min for diltiazem; the
      difference was -0.24 min, with a lower 90% confidence limit of -0.90, which is
      within the stated interval for equivalence. The same result was confirmed by the 
      'intention-to-treat' analysis, and comparable results were obtained both in fixed
      and in variable threshold groups. The incidence of side effects was 12% with
      nifedipine GITS and 8.2% with diltiazem. Nifedipine GITS and diltiazem were found
      to be equally effective in increasing exercise tolerance in chronic stable angina
      patients.

TI  - Felodipine and amlodipine in stable angina pectoris: results of a randomized
      double-blind crossover trial.
PG  - 520-4
AB  - A randomized, double-blind, crossover study tested the antiischemic and
      antianginal efficacy of felodipine, extended-release 5-10 mg, versus amlodipine, 
      5-10 mg once daily. Fifty-two patients with documented exercise-induced angina
      pectoris and myocardial ischemia during 24-h electrocardiographic monitoring were
      included in the study. Forty-seven patients completed the 8-week treatment
      period, whereas five patients withdrew from the study. The mean number of
      ischemic episodes/24 h was reduced from 19.9 at baseline to 2.3 during amlodipine
      and to 2.4 during felodipine; the total duration of ischemic episodes decreased
      from 69.8 min/24 h to 15.2 min and 15.5 min during amlodipine and felodipine,
      respectively (for both variables, p = 0.83 and p = 0.53 between treatments, and
      for both treatments, p < 0.001 compared with baseline). Eighteen (38%) patients
      receiving amlodipine and 19 (40%) patients receiving felodipine showed no
      ST-segment depression during treatment. Maximal ST-depression was reduced from an
      average of 2.1 mm to 1.1 and 1.2 mm on amlodipine and felodipine, respectively (p
      = 0.68 between treatments and p < 0.001 compared with baseline). Mean heart rate 
      remained unchanged compared with baseline. Anginal attacks were reduced from
      16.4/week at baseline to 4.7/week with amlodipine and to 4.3/week with felodipine
      (p = 0.26 between treatments, and p < 0.001 vs. baseline). Accordingly, nitrate
      consumption was reduced from 14.7 capsules per week to 4.0 and 3.8 with
      amlodipine and felodipine, respectively (p = 0.40 between treatments, and p <
      0.001 compared with baseline). Adverse reactions were infrequent and distributed 
      similarly between the two treatments. It is concluded that both drugs effectively
      reduced ischemic episodes and anginal attacks and were well tolerated in patients
      with stable angina pectoris. There was no evidence that the two regimens were
      different in their antiischemic and antianginal properties.

TI  - [Comparative study to assess the efficacy and adverse effects of amlodipine and
      nifedipine retard in patients with stable exertional angina and hypertension].
PG  - 324-8
AB  - The purpose of the study was to compare the antianginal and hypotensive efficacy 
      and tolerability of 8 weeks of treatment with amlodipine taken once daily and
      nifedipine taken twice daily in patients with stable exertional angina pectoris
      and mild-to-moderate hypertension. Following a 2-week placebo run-in-period 13
      patients were randomized to receive amlodipine (5 to 10 mg once daily) and 8
      patients to receive nifedipine (20 or 40 mg twice daily) in an 8-week treatment
      phase. Antianginal efficacy was assessed with angina diares, investigators, and
      patients global evaluations and with treadmill exercise test during placebo
      run-in-period and after 8 weeks of the therapy. Amlodipine significantly reduced 
      both weekly anginal attacks and consumption of glyceryl trinitrate tablets. This 
      effect was more pronounced compared to efficacy of nifedipine. Exercise tolerance
      was also improved more markedly after amlodipine than after nifedipine treatment.
      Amlodipine treatment resulted in significant increase in total exercise time,
      increase the exercise time to angina onset, increase time to ST segment
      depression, decrease in ST segment depression, decrease in total duration of ST
      segment depression and decrease in duration of pain. In patients treated with
      nifedipine only favourable effect was significant decrease in total duration of
      ST segment depression, without significant changes of other examined parameters. 
      Both drugs decreased blood pressure with no significant change in heart rate. No 
      serious adverse events occurred in any patients during therapy with amlodipine as
      well as with nifedipine. The results of the study demonstrate that amlodipine has
      markedly better anti-anginal efficacy than nifedipine with respect to the most of
      the parameters examined. However both drugs showed comparable antihypertensive
      action and both were well tolerated by angina patients. The good anti-anginal and
      hypotensive efficacy and safety of amiodipine with once daily dosage regimen
      makes this drug an excellent choice of treatment for hypertensive patients with
      severe coronary artery disease.

TI  - Intravenous infusions of nifedipine: an alternative for the prevention of
      hypertension in eye surgery under local anesthesia.
PG  - 77-83
AB  - In order to control critical rises of blood pressure during the peri-operative
      period in elderly hypertensive patients, the effectiveness of a continuous
      intravenous infusion of nifedipine was studied. In a double blind study, patients
      (n = 60) who underwent eye surgery under local anesthesia were divided randomly
      into three groups. Patients who were found to have 200 > SBP > 160 and 120 > DBP 
      > 90 mmHg as the previous day of surgery, as well as patients who did not receive
      any anti-hypertensive treatment regimen during the last week before surgery, were
      selected. Five min before performing local anesthesia, a continuous infusion of
      nifedipine at two different rates of 0.65 mg/h and 1.25 mg/h, was administered in
      groups A and B respectively, whereas group C received a placebo. SBP, DBP and HR 
      were recorded every 5 min. for an hour. Statistically significant differences
      among the profiles of the three groups were found. The control group had a higher
      SBP/DBP. None of the groups, showed significant changes in HR. In conclusion, the
      intravenous infusion of nifedipine in a dose 1.25 mg/h, seems to control the
      hypertensive phases of blood pressure, without dropping to any unduly low level, 
      risking undesirable side effects in elderly hypertensive patients during
      perioperative period.

TI  - Site-specific variations in metabolism by human fibroblasts exposed to nifedipine
      in vitro.
PG  - 6-10
AB  - Nifedipine induces overgrowth of gingival tissues in some patients. However,
      other collagenous tissues in their body do not overgrow. The purpose of this
      study was to compare effects of serial dilutions of nifedipine on the in vitro
      metabolism of fibroblasts derived from normal gingiva, nifedipine-induced
      hyperplastic gingiva, knee capsular ligament, and dermis. The data suggested that
      nifedipine affects the metabolism of fibroblasts derived not only from gingiva,
      but also from other collective connective tissues. Thus, nifedipine-responder
      cells are present in tissues other than gingiva. There was an inverse
      relationship between in vivo tissue levels of IL-1-beta and in vitro
      responsiveness to nifedipine of fibroblasts derived from that tissue.
      Nifedipine-induced overgrowth of connective tissues, other than gingiva, probably
      does not occur either because of the relatively slow rate of collagenous protein 
      synthesis by resident fibroblasts or because of alterations in collagen
      deposition/resorption within susceptible tissues produced by nifedipine on
      collagenase synthesis.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new combination
      product, enalapril-diltiazem ER, when administered over the long term. DESIGN:
      Open-label, titration to response, with treatment lasting 46 weeks after a
      6-week, double-blind phase. SETTING: Medical clinics in the private and academic 
      sectors. PATIENTS: Of 265 patients (68% men, 83% Caucasian, mean age 54.9 yrs)
      with essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure 95-115 mm Hg)
      enrolled, 167 completed the trial. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either the
      dosage of enalapril-diltiazem ER that they were given during the double-blind
      phase, or were prescribed enalapril 5 mg-diltiazem ER 120 mg once/day. The dosage
      was increased until blood pressure was controlled or to a maximum of enalapril
      10-diltiazem ER 360 mg/day. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Combination therapy
      decreased sitting blood pressures by -11.1/-10.6 mm Hg. Overall, 58% of the
      patients achieved a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or below at the 
      end of the study. There was no evidence of tolerance to the agents'
      antihypertensive effects. The most common drug-related adverse events were cough,
      headache, dizziness, and asthenia or fatigue. CONCLUSION: The combination
      effectively managed essential hypertension when administered on a long-term basis
      and was generally well tolerated. It should improve both compliance and
      management of hypertension.

TI  - Effectiveness of verapamil-quinidine versus digoxin-quinidine in the emergency
      department treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 126-34
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative effectiveness of a verapamil-quinidine
      sequential combination versus digoxin-quinidine in the emergency department
      treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). METHOD: This prospective,
      double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involved patients, aged 18 to 75
      years, with new-onset (< 48 hours) atrial fibrillation who presented to a
      community-based urban hospital with an annual ED census of 65,000. Exclusion
      criteria included ventricular response rate lower than 100 or higher than 200
      beats/minute, allergy to study drugs, hypotension with evidence of end-organ
      hypoperfusion, and conduction abnormalities. Consenting patients were randomly
      assigned to receive rapid digitalization (1.0 mg over 2 hours) or i.v. verapamil 
      (sequential 5-mg boluses up to 20 mg). After ventricular rate was controlled (<
      100 beats/minute), oral quinidine (200 mg) was initiated and repeated every 2
      hours until conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) occurred, until 1 g of
      quinidine was administered, or until adverse effects supervened. Heart rate,
      blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, time to conversion, and adverse effects were
      documented. RESULTS: Forty-four patients received the study drugs. Three were
      withdrawn, leaving 19 in the verapamil-quinidine (VER-Q) group and 22 in the
      digoxin-quinidine (DIG-Q) group. Sixteen patients (84%) in the VER-Q group and 10
      (45%) in the DIG-Q group converted to NSR within 6 hours (P < .02). Mean time to 
      conversion (+/-SD) was 185 +/- 146 minutes for VER-Q and 368 +/- 386 minutes for 
      DIG-Q patients (P = NS). Twelve VER-Q patients (63%) and 6 DIG-Q patients (27%)
      were discharged from the ED (P < .05). Minor adverse effects were more common in 
      the VER-Q group. No mortality or significant morbidity occurred. CONCLUSION: The 
      sequential combination of verapamil and quinidine, in the doses studied, is an
      effective treatment for PAF and is superior to digoxin-quinidine. Digoxin should 
      no longer be considered the treatment of choice for uncomplicated PAF.

TI  - Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system versus atenolol in stable angina
      pectoris. The Netherlands Working Group on Cardiovascular Research (WCN).
PG  - 143-50
AB  - The gastrointestinal therapeutic system formulation of nifedipine enables a
      once-daily dosing resulting in predictable, relatively constant plasma
      concentrations. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of this formulation and to
      compare this with the beta-blocker atenolol, we conducted a double-blind,
      randomised, multi-centre study in 129 male patients with documented exercise
      induced angina pectoris. After 4 weeks' treatment, nifedipine (60 mg), improved
      time to onset of 0.1 mV ST-segment depression from 536 s by 72 +/- 117s, time to 
      onset of pain from 619 s by 56 +/- 120 s, and total exercise time from 685 s by
      40 +/- 88 s. Atenolol 100 mg, had a comparable effect, time to onset of 0.1 mV
      ST-segment depression improved from 496 s by 53 +/- 129 s, time to onset of pain 
      from 572 s by 57 +/- 118 s, and total exercise time from 653 s by 33 +/- 99 s.
      Between group analysis revealed no statistically significant differences for
      these exercise parameters. Atenolol, but not nifedipine, significantly reduced
      heart rate and systolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise (P < 0.001
      between groups), indicating different modes of action of the drugs. With regard
      to safety, both drugs were generally well tolerated. There were significantly (P 
      = 0.01) more vasodilation related side effects with nifedipine. These data
      demonstrate that gastrointestinal therapeutic system formulation of nifedipine
      and atenolol as once-daily monotherapy are equally effective and safe, but with
      different effects on exercise parameters.

TI  - Effects of bunazosin and atenolol on serum lipids and apolipoproteins in a
      randomised trial.
PG  - 354-9
AB  - The effects of bunazosin and atenolol on serum lipids and lipoproteins after 6
      months of treatment were compared in this multicentric, double-blind, randomised 
      trial. A total of 174 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension from 
      15 hospitals in Germany and Poland was included in the study. Eighty-seven were
      treated with the alpha-receptor blocker bunazosin and the same number with the
      beta-blocker atenolol. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased
      significantly in both groups, whereas only atenolol decreased pulse rate. In the 
      bunazosin group HDL-cholesterol was significantly increased after 6 months of
      treatment, whereas all other analysed parameters remained unchanged. In the
      atenolol group total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total triglycerides,
      apolipoprotein E, VLDL-cholesterol and VLDL-triglycerides were significantly
      increased after 6 months of therapy. There was a significant difference between
      bunazosin and atenolol for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol,
      VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL-triglycerides and apolipoprotein B levels. 
      As a consequence, there was a significant difference in the atherogenic index of 
      both groups. We conclude that bunazosin is favorable in the treatment of high
      blood pressure, because the coronary risk is not negatively influenced as shown
      for atenolol.

TI  - [The effects of treatment with trapidil compared to nifedipine on physical,
      emotional and cognitive exercise tolerance in patients with coronary heart
      disease].
PG  - 868-74
AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate exercise test results and the
      outcome of the quality of life after administration of trapidil (CAS 15421-84-8, 
      Rocornal) or nifedipine (CAS 21829-25-4) to patients with coronary heart disease.
      The characteristics of the life quality in combination with the results of
      exercise test are considered of great importance for selecting medical treatment 
      in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. However, little information is
      available on how this first evaluation may be used to select the best
      pharmacological approach in individual patients. In this prospective multicentre 
      study, 144 patients with stable angina were enrolled in 6 centres. Due to
      protocol violations and drop-outs 116 patients were evaluated for tolerability;
      101 patients were evaluated for efficacy. After baseline evaluation, consisting
      of an exercise test and a questioning investigating patients' anginal symptoms
      and several psychometric testings, the patients were randomly allocated to
      double-blind treatment for 12 weeks with either trapidil, 200 mg t.i.d. or
      nifedipine, 10 mg t.i.d. according to a parallel group design. After 6 and 12
      weeks exercise tests and psychometric testings were repeated. Both trapidil and
      nifedipine prolonged exercise tolerance (trapidil 39.2% vs. nifedipine 33.3%) or 
      increased the total exercise over baseline levels (trapidil 57.8% vs. nifedipine 
      61.2%). Using Mann-Whitney U-test the SB-S-rating scale and the physician's
      assessment revealed a comparable improvement of life quality (trapidil 69.4% vs. 
      nifedipine 80.0%) under both treatments. In addition patient questioning showed a
      significant reduction in angina attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption. None of
      the characteristics of anginal symptoms or exercise test gave evidence for a
      significant difference between nifedipine and trapidil. Both drugs demonstrated
      similar safety profiles (adverse events (AEs) 12.7% for trapidil and 11.1% for
      nifedipine); four patients of the trapidil group and one of the nifedipine group 
      discontinued the clinical trial because of AEs. The results of a baseline
      exercise test and rating questionnaires may offer useful information for
      selecting medical treatment in stable angina pectoris.

TI  - [Short and long-term clinical tolerance of hypertensive treatment during the HOT 
      study (Hypertension Optimal Treatment)].
PG  - 1093-6
AB  - International, prospective, randomized HOT study aims to determine the optimal BP
      level under treatment in order to reduce at the most the cardiovascular
      morbidity/mortality. Defined by randomization, the level to obtain is DBP < or = 
      80, 85, 90 mmHg. The treatment is started by felodipine 5 mg/day then, if
      necessary, a bitherapy is prescribed and then, if necessary, a tritherapy. 19,193
      patients have been included (BP at randomization 170 +/- 15/105 +/- 4 mmHg).
      After 1 year treatment, it is possible to search for the influence on the
      clinical tolerance of sex, age, BP goal, geographic area, time and treatment. The
      percentage of patients with side effects by BP goals and by treatment type are,
      during the time and in different geographic areas, the following (NE/Northern
      Europe = Norway, Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, The
      Netherlands, UK, Germany, Austria; SE/Southern Europe = Italy, Spain, Greece):
      [table: see text] The target BP and age don't nearly influence the clinical
      tolerance. The side effects reported by the physicians are more numerous at the
      treatment start than at longeur terme. That is due to the therapeutic
      modifications of the physicians or to a better acceptation of the drugs by the
      patients or to a real disappearance of the side effects. Reported side effects
      are more frequent in Southern Europe, France than Northern Europe and more
      frequent among women that men. The incidence of side effects is proportional to
      the number of prescribed drugs. Time and the number of antihypertensive drugs
      appear as the most important factors.

TI  - Efficacy, tolerability, and effects on quality of life of losartan, alone or with
      hydrochlorothiazide, versus amlodipine, alone or with hydrochlorothiazide, in
      patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 608-25
AB  - A randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial was
      conducted to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and effects on quality of life
      associated with treatment regimens including the angiotensin II receptor
      antagonist losartan, with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) added as needed, with
      regimens including the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine with
      HCTZ added as needed. The trial included patients whose sitting diastolic blood
      pressure (SiDBP) measurements were between 95 and 114 mm Hg, inclusive, at
      placebo baseline. Patients were randomized to receive either losartan or
      amlodipine in a double-masked, double-dummy fashion. A 4-week placebo washout
      period was followed by a 12-week active treatment period. Patients in the
      losartan arm (n = 97) were initially given 50 mg of oral (PO) losartan once a day
      (QD); the medication could be titrated to 50-mg losartan/ 12.5-mg HCTZ PO QD
      after 4 weeks, followed by 50-mg losartan plus 25-mg HCTZ PO QD after 8 weeks as 
      necessary. Patients in the amlodipine group (n = 93) received 5-mg amlodipine PO 
      QD, which could be titrated to 10 mg PO QD after 4 weeks, followed by 10 mg plus 
      25-mg HCTZ PO QD after 8 weeks. Medication was titrated upward as necessary to
      achieve trough SiDBP < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy, tolerability, and quality-of-life
      scores were assessed after 12 weeks of therapy with each regimen. Trough SiDBP
      reductions after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of therapy were clinically comparable
      (losartan group: 7.3, 10.4, and 11.1 mm Hg, respectively; amlodipine group: 7.9, 
      11.2, and 11.8 mm Hg, respectively). Similar reductions in systolic blood
      pressure were also seen for both treatment groups. The percentage of patients
      reaching goal SiDBP (defined as trough SiDBP < 90 mm Hg or SiDBP > or = 90 mm Hg 
      with a > or = 10 mm Hg drop from placebo baseline) was comparable for the two
      groups, with 68% of patients in the losartan group and 71% of patients in the
      amlodipine group reaching goal. Significantly more patients in the amlodipine
      group had drug-related adverse experiences (27% vs 13%). In particular,
      drug-related edema was more common in patients receiving the amlodipine regimen
      than in those receiving the losartan regimen (11% vs 1%). Patients in the
      amlodipine arm reported significantly more bother due to edema, regardless of
      whether edema was present at baseline, than did patients in the losartan arm (12%
      vs 2%), although overall quality of life was not different in the two treatment
      groups. This study demonstrates that a regimen of losartan with HCTZ added as
      needed, when compared with a regimen of amlodipine with HCTZ added as needed,
      provides comparable efficacy and superior tolerability and less bother to
      patients with respect to edema.

TI  - Treatment of hypertension associated with stable angina pectoris: favourable
      interaction between new metoprolol formulation (OROS) and nifedipine.
PG  - 635-43
AB  - This was a double-blind, within-patient, crossover study to evaluate the effects 
      of a new formulation of metoprolol on blood pressure (BP) and myocardial
      ischemia. Twenty outpatients with mild to moderate essential arterial
      hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris and positive exercise test, after a 
      2-week baseline placebo period, were randomized to receive long-acting metoprolol
      (OROS) 14/190 mg o.d., nifedipine SR 20 mg b.i.d. or their combination in a
      sequence of a 3 x 3 Latin square design. Two patients withdrew from the study (1 
      for adverse event during metoprolol and 1 for rise of BP during nifedipine).
      Nifedipine, metoprolol and their combination significantly reduced the weekly
      number of angina attacks and nitroglycerin consumption with respect to baseline. 
      The total number of ischemic events (at 24-hour ECG monitoring) significantly
      decreased after each treatment with respect to baseline. Twenty-four hours mean
      systolic and diastolic BP were reduced by both nifedipine alone and metoprolol
      alone; the combination of the two drugs led to a further decrease in both
      systolic and diastolic BP. The duration of silent ischemic episodes was
      significantly reduced by nifedipine and combination but not by metoprolol. On the
      other hand 24 hours symptomatic attacks/patient were significantly reduced by
      beta-blocker and combination, but not by nifedipine. Metoprolol alone and
      administered with nifedipine caused a decrease, with respect to placebo baseline,
      in 24-hour mean heart rate (HR) and reduced the increase of HR and systolic BP at
      the onset of ST depression during symptomatic ischemic episodes. The effort time 
      and time to ST = -1 mm at treadmill were significantly increased by treatment
      with nifedipine alone, with metoprolol alone and with their combination, but the 
      combination was more effective than the individual therapies. ST depression at
      peak exercise was significantly reduced by each treatment. The slopes of
      correlations between the ST-segment variation and systolic BP, HR and
      rate-pressure product during exercise, significantly decreased after all
      treatments with respect to placebo baseline, more with the combination therapy
      than with nifedipine alone and metoprolol alone. In conclusion, based on our
      results the favourable interaction of metoprolol OROS and nifedipine given
      concomitantly, is likely to be due to a better control, respect to each
      individual therapy, of the pathogenetic mechanism of myocardia ischemia: BP and
      HR increases during exercise and during symptomatic ischemic episodes are
      controlled by the beta-blocker and coronary vasoconstriction during silent
      ischemia is prevented by the calcium-antagonist.

TI  - Prognostic significance of transient ischemic episodes: response to treatment
      shows improved prognosis. Results of the Total Ischemic Burden Bisoprolol Study
      (TIBBs) follow-up.
PG  - 20-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Total Ischemic Burden Bisoprolol Study (TIBBS) follow-up examined
      cardiac event rates in relation to transient ischemia and its treatment.
      BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether transient ischemia on the ambulatory
      electrocardiogram has prognostic implications in stable angina and whether
      medical treatment can improve the prognosis. METHODS: The TIBBS trial was an
      8-week, randomized, controlled comparison of the effects of bisoprolol and
      nifedipine on transient ischemic episodes in patients with stable angina
      pectoris. Of the 545 patients screened, 520 (95.4%) could be followed up. Rates
      of cardiac and noncardiac death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, hospital
      admission for unstable angina and need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery
      or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were recorded. RESULTS: A total
      of 145 events occurred in 120 (23.1%) of 520 patients. Patients with more than
      six episodes had an event rate of 32.5% compared with 25.0% for patients with two
      to six episodes and 13.2% for patients with less than two episodes (p < 0.001).
      Hard events (death, acute myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable 
      angina pectoris) were more frequent in patients with two or more ischemic
      episodes (12.2% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.0049). Patients with a 100% response rate of
      transient ischemic episodes during the TIBBS trial had a 17.5% event rate at 1
      year compared with 32.3% for non-100% responders (p = 0.008). Patients receiving 
      bisoprolol during the TIBBS tria had a lower event rate (22.1%) at 1 year than
      patients randomized to nifedipine (33.1%, p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: In patients
      with stable angina pectoris, frequent episodes of transient ischemia are a marker
      for an increased event rate. A 100% response to medical treatment reduces the
      event rate. The greater reduction of ischemia with bisoprolol than nifedipine
      during the TIBBS trial translated into an improved outcome at 1 year.

TI  - Treatment of out-of-hospital supraventricular tachycardia: adenosine vs
      verapamil.
PG  - 574-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the use of adenosine and the use of verapamil as
      out-of-hospital therapy for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). METHODS: A period
      of prospective adenosine use (March 1993 to February 1994) was compared with a
      historical control period of verapamil use (March 1990 to February 1991) for SVT.
      Data were obtained for SVT patients treated in a metropolitan,
      fire-department-based paramedic system serving a population of approximately 1
      million persons. Standard drug protocols were used and patient outcomes (i.e.,
      conversion rates, complications, and recurrences) were monitored. RESULTS: During
      the adenosine treatment period, 105 patients had SVT; 87 (83%) received
      adenosine, of whom 60 (69%) converted to a sinus rhythm (SR). Vagal maneuvers
      (VM) resulted in restoration of SR in 8 patients (7.6%). Some patients received
      adenosine for non-SVT rhythms: 7 sinus tachycardia, 18 atrial fibrilation, 7
      wide-complex tachycardia (WCT), and 2 ventricular tachycardia; no non-SVT rhythm 
      converted to SR and none of these patients experienced an adverse effect.
      Twenty-five patients were hemodynamically unstable (systolic blood pressure < 90 
      mm Hg), with 20 receiving drug and 13 converting to SR; 8 patients required
      electrical cardioversion. Four patients experienced adverse effects related to
      adenosine (chest pain dyspnea, prolonged bradycardia, and ventricular
      tachycardia). In the verapamil period, 106 patients had SVT: 52 (49%) received
      verapamil (p < 0.001, compared with the adenosine period), of whom 43 (88%)
      converted to SR (p = 0.11). Two patients received verapamil for WCT; neither
      converted to SR and both experienced cardiovascular collapse. VM resulted in
      restoration of SR in 12 patients (11.0%) (p = 0.52). Sixteen patients were
      hemodynamically unstable, with 5 receiving drug (p = 0.005) and 5 converting to
      SR; 9 patients required electrical cardioversion (p = 0.48). Four patients
      experienced adverse effects related to verapamil (hypotension ventricular
      tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation). Recurrence of SVT was noted in 2
      adenosine patients and 2 verapamil patients in the out-of-hospital setting and in
      23 adenosine patients and 15 verapamil patients after ED arrival, necessitating
      additional therapy (p = 0.48 and 0.88, for recurrence rates and types of
      additional therapies, respectively). Hospital diagnoses, outcomes, and ED
      dispositions were similar for the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Adenosine and verapamil
      were equally successful in converting out-of-hospital SVT in patients with
      similar etiologies responsible for the SVT. Recurrence of SVT occurred at similar
      rates for the 2 medications. Rhythm misidentification remains a common issue in
      out-of-hospital cardiac care in this emergency medical services system.

PG  - 573-7
AB  - We studied the therapeutic substitution of a less expensive but equally effective
      antihypertensive agent and assessed patient outcome. The medication of 39
      patients with hypertension was changed from once-daily diltiazem hydrochloride
      (Cardizem CD) or nifedipine (Procardia XL) to felodipine (Plendil). Titration to 
      a final dose was based on home and office blood pressure measurements assessed
      over subsequent follow-up clinic visits. Self-administered questionnaires
      measured different aspects of well-being and symptoms before and after the change
      in medication. Eighty percent of the cohort switched successfully to felodipine. 
      Office systolic and diastolic pressures improved after the medication change
      (systolic: 150 mm Hg versus 144 mm Hg; diastolic: 92 mm Hg versus 87 mm Hg). No
      statistically significant differences were found among the 39 symptoms measured. 
      A yearly savings potential for our institution was estimated to be $72,000.

TI  - [Effectiveness of depot diltiazem in stable effort angina: a double-blind study
      compared with placebo].
PG  - 527-32
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The antianginal efficacy of slow-release (SR) Diltiazem and
      change in ergometric parameters during treatment were evaluated in patients with 
      stable effort angina. METHODS: Forty eight patients with documented ischemic
      cardiopathy were studied. The study design was double blind randomised cross over
      versus placebo. After a 7 days run-in period of pharmacological washout, patients
      were randomised to treatment with diltiazem SR (120 mgs bid) or placebo for 1
      week, followed by crossover of treatments. No concomitant antianginal therapy,
      except sublingual nitro-glycerine was allowed during the trial. Exercise tests
      were performed during the run-in period and at the end of each week of treatment.
      RESULTS: After diltiazem administration, exercise duration increased
      significantly in comparison with placebo (645.6 +/- 196.31 vs 563.9 +/- 244.52 s,
      p < 0.01). Similarly, time to onset of angina and time to ischemic threshold
      increased in comparison to placebo (603.78 +/- 198.50 vs 459.69 +/- 239.40 s, p <
      0.01 and 576.06 +/- 208.88 vs 463.16 +/- 246.12 s, p < 0.01 respectively). No
      significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure and double product at ischemic 
      threshold and peak exercise were detected. CONCLUSIONS: SR-diltiazem is effective
      and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with stable angina.

TI  - [Efficacy and tolerability of felodipine and nifedipine in stable angina
      refractory to beta-blocker therapy].
PG  - 407-17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical therapy of stable angina contemplates beta-blockers as a
      first line. The combination of dihydropyridines with beta-blocking drugs enhances
      the effectiveness of both single therapies. Nifedipine, in the usual formulation 
      (AR), is burdened by an unsatisfactory tolerability, and this is the main reason 
      to study new dihydropyridines. AIM: To compare efficacy and tolerability of
      felodipine ER 10 mg o.d. with that of nifedipine AR 20 mg b.d. in patients with
      stable angina pectoris refractory to beta-blocker therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Of 15 initial patients, 14 were entirely evaluable for the study, the design of
      which was double blind, double dummy, random cross over and placebo controlled.
      All patients showed reproducible threshold of ischemia at exercise testing. In
      constancy of beta-blocker therapy, they were given placebos for 2 weeks, then one
      of the active drugs with a placebo of the other one for 4 weeks, followed by the 
      cross-over period of 4 weeks. Efficacy and tolerability of treatments were
      evaluated by clinical observation and rest and exercise radionuclide angiography.
      At the end of each individual study, it was decided blindly if and which of the 2
      drugs seemed preferable, considering symptoms, undesired collateral effects and
      the results of exercise procedures. RESULTS: The efficacy on angina of the 2
      active treatments was not different. More patients suffered undesired side
      effects on nifedipine than on felodipine. Left ventricular ejection fraction
      (LVEF) at rest was 65.3 +/- 4.3% (s.e.) on placebo, 64.6 +/- 2.6% on felodipine
      and 67.5 +/- 2.5% on nifedipine (p n.s.). A significant reduction in resting LV
      function (that is, a decrease of LVEF > or = 5%) was observed in 2 patients on
      felodipine and 3 on nifedipine, but in both groups other 3 patients showed
      improvement in LVEF. During exercise, LVEF decreased 6.1 +/- 2.0% on placebo and 
      3.3 +/- 3.2% on nifedipine, while it increased 1.0 +/- 2.6% on felodipine (p <
      0.01 vs. placebo). At the end of the study, felodipine was blindly judged
      superior to nifedipine in 10 patients, nifedipine was superior in 1 case, in the 
      other 3 there was no clear difference (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In 14 patients
      with stable angina refractory to beta-blockers, the addition of felodipine or
      nifedipine has similar antiischemic effects. However, felodipine showed better
      results in LVEF response to exercise and less side effects, and this leaded to a 
      more frequent blind choice of felodipine versus nifedipine to add to beta-blocker
      therapy.

TI  - Verapamil as prophylactic treatment for atrial fibrillation after lung
      operations.
PG  - 1083-5; discussion 1086
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is a frequently occurring arrhythmia after
      thoracic operations. Preventive strategies for this complication have been
      extensively evaluated after cardiac operations. METHODS: We performed a
      prospective, open randomized study, comparing intravenous verapamil and placebo
      in 199 patients after pneumonectomy or lobectomy at the University Hospital of
      Leuven. Verapamil was administered as a bolus of 10 mg over 2 minutes followed by
      a 30-minute infusion of 0.375 mg/min and then 0.125 mg/min for 3 days. The
      patients were continuously monitored in the postoperative intensive care unit.
      RESULTS: Atrial fibrillation occurred in 15% of the patients receiving placebo
      and in 8% of the patients receiving verapamil (difference not significant). The
      verapamil infusion was interrupted in 9% of the patients because of bradycardia
      and in 14% because of hypotension. CONCLUSIONS: If tolerated, continuous
      intravenous verapamil infusion showed only a modest prophylactic efficacy for the
      occurrence of atrial fibrillation after lung operations. In the dose employed the
      verapamil infusion was accompanied with a high incidence of side effects
      necessitating interruption of the therapy.

TI  - Anti-ischaemic efficacy of L-propionylcarnitine--a promising novel metabolic
      approach to ischaemia?
PG  - 414-20
AB  - L-propionylcarnitine, a naturally occurring derivative of L-carnitine, essential 
      for mitochondrial fatty acid transport and high-energy phosphate exchange,
      acutely reduces myocardial ischaemia and improves ischaemia-induced cardiac
      dysfunction following intravenous administration. This randomized, crossover
      study was designed to compare the long-term anti-ischaemic effects of oral
      L-propionylcarnitine with diltiazem in patients with stable, exercise-induced
      angina. After a 2-week washout phase of anti-anginal medication and a 2-week
      single-blind placebo period, 46 patients were included in the study, 23 of whom
      received 1500 mg L-propionylcarnitine daily for 6 weeks, and 23 diltiazem (180 mg
      daily for 3 weeks, followed by 360 mg daily for 3 weeks), crossing over to the
      other treatment after a 1-week washout period. Three patients on
      L-propionylcarnitine and two on diltiazem discontinued. Both treatments resulted 
      in comparable exercise duration (582 +/- 35 s and 588 +/- 33 s, mean +/- SEM),
      time to 0.1 mV ST depression (436 +/- 38 s and 465 +/- 36 s), and increase in
      time to 0.1 mV ST depression from baseline (20% and 28%), L-propionylcarnitine
      and diltiazem, respectively. Diltiazem decreased the rate-pressure product at
      rest and exercise, L-propionylcarnitine did not. Both compounds significantly
      reduced ST depression at maximal exercise [23% (L-propionylcarnitine) vs 35%
      (diltiazem), P < 0.05 diltiazem vs L-propionylcarnitine]. Diltiazem increased the
      time to onset of angina by 22%. In contrast, no significant changes occurred with
      L-propionylcarnitine. During the study, anginal attacks were reduced by 70% and
      57%, and nitroglycerin consumption decreased by 57% and 70%, L-propionylcarnitine
      and diltiazem, respectively. Thus, both L-propionylcarnitine and (high-dose)
      diltiazem result in anti-ischaemic effects and decrease anginal attacks in daily 
      life. Although the effect of diltiazem on exercise-induced ischaemia appears more
      pronounced than that of L-propionylcarnitine, this novel metabolic approach to
      ischaemia warrants further development.

TI  - [Evaluation of amlodipine in stable effort angina. Comparison with diltiazem in
      terms of efficacy, tolerability and maintenance of the anti-ischemic action 24
      hours after the last dose].
PG  - 74-82
AB  - 83 patients were enrolled in a multicentre, randomized, open study to assess the 
      efficacy of amlodipine in stable effort angina. Preselected patients were
      submitted to a one-week placebo wash-out period during which only nitrates or
      molsidomine were authorized. Patients were then randomized to receive either 5 mg
      of amlodipine as a morning dose, or 180 mg of diltiazem in three divided doses.
      After two weeks, the dosage was able to be increased (according to clinical
      efficacy) to 10 mg of amlodipine as a single dose or 240 mg of diltiazem in four 
      divided doses. The antianginal efficacy of these two treatments was essentially
      evaluated in terms of the results of stress tests (ST) conducted at the end of
      the second week and fourth week of active treatment: and 24 hours after the last 
      dose of the drug. The results of 63 patients who scrupulously complied with the
      protocol showed that amlodipine and diltiazem corrected or improved the ST
      parameters (time to onset and amplitude of ST depression, duration of ST, work
      performed). The anti-ischaemic action of amlodipine was maintained for at least
      24 hours after the last dose and therefore provides better security (by covering 
      the entire 24-hour period) and better compliance (by tolerating a dose omission
      of several hours).

TI  - A comparison of nifedipine once daily (Adalat LA), isosorbide mononitrate once
      daily, and isosorbide dinitrate twice daily in patients with chronic stable
      angina.
PG  - 117-26
AB  - The efficacy of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS), 60-90 mg
      o.d., isosorbide dinitrate, 40-60 mg b.d., and isosorbide mononitrate
      slow-release, 50-100 mg o.d. was assessed in a six week double-blind,
      parallel-group study in patients with stable angina on chronic beta-blocker
      treatment. Of 339 patients who entered the study, 229 were eligible for the valid
      case analysis of efficacy and 335 for the safety analysis. Nifedipine GITS was
      significantly better than isosorbide dinitrate (P < or = 0.025) in prolonging
      time to 1 mm ST-segment depression, time to maximum ST-segment depression, time
      to occurrence of angina and total exercise duration, in addition to reducing the 
      number of angina attacks and glyceryl trinitrate consumption after six weeks
      therapy. Nifedipine GITS was also significantly better than isosorbide
      mononitrate (P < or = 0.025) in prolonging time to occurrence of angina and time 
      to 1 mm ST-segment depression after six weeks therapy. The incidence of headache 
      was considerably higher in both the isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide
      mononitrate groups (40% and 41%, respectively) than in the nifedipine GITS group 
      (9.5%, P < or = 0.001), and was the main reason for withdrawal from the study
      (isosorbide dinitrate 18/99, isosorbide mononitrate 17/99, nifedipine GITS 2/95).
      Peripheral oedema was more common in patients treated with nifedipine GITS
      (12.5%) compared to nitrates (2% in both groups, P < or = 0.01), but resulted in 
      withdrawal of only one patient (treated with nifedipine GITS). This study
      suggests that the efficacy and tolerability of nifedipine GITS is superior to
      long acting nitrates as second-line therapy to beta-blockade in the treatment of 
      chronic stable angina.

TI  - Combination therapy with metoprolol and nifedipine versus monotherapy in patients
      with stable angina pectoris. Results of the International Multicenter Angina
      Exercise (IMAGE) Study.
PG  - 311-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate whether combination therapy
      with metoprolol and nifedipine provides a greater anti-ischemic effect than does 
      monotherapy in individual patients with stable angina pectoris. BACKGROUND:
      Combination therapy with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (which reduces
      myocardial oxygen consumption) and a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (which
      increases coronary blood flow) is a logical approach to the treatment of stable
      angina pectoris. However, it is not clear whether, in individual patients, this
      combined therapy is more effective than monotherapy. METHODS: Two hundred eighty 
      patients with stable angina pectoris were enrolled in a double-blind trial in 25 
      European centers. Patients were randomized (week 0) to metoprolol (controlled
      release, 200 mg once daily) or nifedipine (Retard, 20 mg twice daily) for 6
      weeks; placebo or the alternative drug was then added for a further 4 weeks.
      Exercise tests were performed at weeks 0, 6 and 10. RESULTS: At week 6, both
      metoprolol and nifedipine increased the mean exercise time to 1-mm ST segment
      depression in comparison with week 0 (both p < 0.01); metoprolol was more
      effective than nifedipine (p < 0.05). At week 10, the groups randomized to
      combination therapy had a further increase in time to 1-mm ST segment depression 
      (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). Analysis of the results in individual patients revealed
      that 7 (11%) of 63 patients adding nifedipine to metoprolol and 17 (29%) of 59
      patients (p < 0.0001) adding metoprolol to nifedipine showed an increase in
      exercise tolerance that was greater than the 90th percentile of the distribution 
      of the changes observed in the corresponding monotherapy + placebo groups.
      However, among these patients, an additive effect was observed only in 1 (14%) of
      the 7 patients treated with metoprolol + nifedipine and in 4 (24%) of the 17
      treated with nifedipine + metoprolol. CONCLUSIONS: The mean additive
      anti-ischemic effect shown by combination therapy with metoprolol and nifedipine 
      in patients with stable angina pectoris is not the result of an additive effect
      in individual patients. Rather, it may be attributed to the recruitment by the
      second drug of patients not responding to monotherapy.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of low-dose propranolol versus diltiazem in the prophylaxis
      of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia after coronary artery bypass grafting.
PG  - 412-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) complicate postoperative
      management after coronary bypass surgery in about 30% of all patients. Though a
      prophylactic treatment both with beta-adrenergic blocking agents and the calcium 
      antagonist diltiazem has been used for the prevention of post-operative SVT, no
      study yet has performed a prospective comparison of the efficacy of these
      therapies. METHODS: To investigate the prophylactic effect of either a calcium
      antagonist (diltiazem, 0.1 mg/kg per h i.v.) or a beta-adrenergic blocking agent 
      (propranolol, 10 mg every 6 h postoperatively), we randomized prospectively 103
      consecutive patients into three groups, the third one serving as a control group.
      Anti-arrhythmic medication was started with the procedure and was continued until
      the 3rd postoperative day. RESULTS: Preoperative conditions were the same for the
      three groups concerning age, extent of coronary heart disease, ventricular
      function and heart-related medication. There were no differences in
      intraoperative parameters or postoperative enzyme patterns. Diltiazem was
      ineffective in preventing SVT, the incidence being exactly the same as in the
      control group (35%). Propranolol reduced the occurrence of SVT significantly (7%,
      P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients treated with diltiazem needed positive inotropic
      support more often in the first hours after surgery than patients of the control 
      group (30% vs 5%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The perioperative administration of
      low-dose propranolol is considered a safe and effective drug prophylaxis to avoid
      the occurrence of SVT after bypass surgery.

TI  - The Total Ischaemic Burden European Trial (TIBET). Effects of atenolol,
      nifedipine SR and their combination on the exercise test and the total ischaemic 
      burden in 608 patients with stable angina. The TIBET Study Group.
PG  - 96-103
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of atenolol, nifedipine and their
      combination on exercise parameters and ambulatory ischaemic activity in patients 
      with mild chronic stable angina. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study
      involving 608 patients from 69 centres in nine countries. DESIGN: Placebo washout
      followed by double-blind parallel-group study comparing atenolol 50 mg bd,
      nifedipine SR 20 mg bd, and their combination. Patients underwent maximal
      exercise testing using either a bicycle (n = 289) or treadmill (n = 319) and 48 h
      of ambulatory ST segment monitoring outside the hospital environment at the end
      of the placebo washout period and after 6 weeks of active therapy. RESULTS: Both 
      medications alone and in combination caused significant improvements in exercise 
      parameters and significant reductions in ischaemic activity during daily
      activities, when compared with placebo. There were, however, no significant
      differences between groups, for any of the measured ischaemic parameters although
      combination therapy resulted in a greater fall in resting systolic and diastolic 
      blood pressure than either treatment alone. CONCLUSIONS: In the management of
      mild chronic stable angina there appears to be little advantage gained from using
      combination therapy for ischaemia reduction.

TI  - Randomised, double-blind trial of intravenous diltiazem versus glyceryl
      trinitrate for unstable angina pectoris.
PG  - 1653-7
AB  - The effect of dihydropyridines in patients with unstable angina is discouraging. 
      To find out the effect of the non-dihydropyridine-like calcium-channel blocker
      diltiazem, a randomised, double-blind trial was conducted comparing diltiazem
      with glyceryl trinitrate, both given intravenously, in 129 patients with unstable
      angina. The endpoints were refractory angina or myocardial infarction,
      individually and as a composite endpoint. Refractory angina alone or together
      with myocardial infarction occurred significantly less commonly in the diltiazem 
      group. While patients were on the trial drugs the numbers with refractory angina 
      were 6 (10%) in the diltiazem group versus 17 (28%) in the glyceryl trinitrate
      group (relative risk 0.36, p = 0.02), and the numbers with refractory angina and 
      myocardial infarction were 9 (15%) versus 23 (38%) (relative risk 0.40, p =
      0.007). Over 48 h the number were: refractory angina 8 (13%) versus 18 (30%),
      relative risk 0.45, p = 0.03, and refractory angina and myocardial infarction 12 
      (20.0%) versus 25 (41%), relative risk 0.49, p = 0.02. Patients in the diltiazem 
      group had better (p < 0.05) event-free survival while taking the drugs.
      Heart-rate pressure product was reduced significantly only by diltiazem (p <
      0.05). The incidence of bradyarrhythmias did not differ significantly.
      Atrioventricular conduction disturbances occurred in 5 (8%) patients in the
      diltiazem group but were not seen in the glyceryl trinitrate group (p = 0.03).
      These disturbances could be reversed by decreasing the dose of the drug or
      withdrawing it. No temporary pacemakers were required. Headache requiring an
      analgesic or dose adjustment occurred significantly less in the diltiazem group: 
      3 (5%) versus 15 (25%), relative risk 0.20 (p < 0.004). These results indicate
      that intravenous diltiazem, compared with intravenous glyceryl trinitrate,
      significantly reduces ischaemic events and can be used safely in patients with
      unstable angina.

TI  - Comparison of antihypertensive effects of nicardipine with nitroglycerin for
      perioperative hypertension.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy of intravenous (iv) nicardipine with
      nitroglycerin for the treatment for patients with perioperative hypertension.
      METHODS: Forty patients with perioperative hypertension randomly divided into two
      groups were treated with intravenous calcium entry blocker, nicardipine, or
      vasodilator, nitroglycerin. Haemodynamic measurements including mean arterial and
      pulmonary arterial pressure, central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge
      pressure, and cardiac output were recorded; peripheral and pulmonary vascular
      resistance were calculated. RESULTS: Both medications were effective in reducing 
      blood pressure and controlling haemodynamics. During the maintenance by
      continuous iv infusion, nicardipine controlled hypertension more rapidly than
      nitroglycerin (nicardipine 10.5 +/- 2.5 min and nitroglycerin 18.7 +/- 2.8 min, p
      < 0.05) without significant alteration in heart rate. The total frequency of dose
      adjustments required to achieve therapeutic response was significantly less in
      the nicardipine-treated group (2.5 +/- 0.3 for nicardipine and 6.2 +/- 1.4 for
      nitroglycerin, p < 0.05). Incidence of hypotensive episodes during the infusion
      were observed in both groups [nicardipine 5% (1/20) and nitroglycerin 30% (6/20),
      p < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous nicardipine is as effective as nitroglycerin 
      in the treatment of perioperative hypertension. Specific advantages have been
      identified such as stable dose-response effect, less hypotensive and tachycardial
      effects during the use of iv nicardipine in treatment of hypertensive patients.

TI  - Effects of regular exercise on blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy in
      African-American men with severe hypertension.
PG  - 1462-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of hypertension and its cardiovascular complications
      is higher in African Americans than in whites. Interventions to control blood
      pressure in this population are particularly important. Regular exercise lowers
      blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, but its effects in
      patients with severe hypertension have not been studied. We examined the effects 
      of moderately intense exercise on blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy
      in African-American men with severe hypertension. METHODS: We randomly assigned
      46 men 35 to 76 years of age to exercise plus antihypertensive medication (23
      men) or antihypertensive medication alone (23 men). A total of 18 men in the
      exercise group completed 16 weeks of exercise, and 14 completed 32 weeks of
      exercise, which was performed three times per week at 60 to 80 percent of the
      maximal heart rate. RESULTS: After 16 weeks, mean (+/- SD) diastolic blood
      pressure had decreased from 88 +/- 7 to 83 +/- 8 mm Hg in the patients who
      exercised, whereas it had increased slightly, from 88 +/- 6 to 90 +/- 7 mm Hg, in
      those who did not exercise (P = 0.002). Diastolic blood pressure remained
      significantly lower after 32 weeks of exercise, even with substantial reductions 
      in the dose of antihypertensive medication. In addition, the thickness of the
      interventricular septum (P = 0.03), the left ventricular mass (P = 0.02), and the
      mass index (P = 0.04) had decreased significantly after 16 weeks in the patients 
      who exercised, whereas there was no significant change in the nonexercisers.
      CONCLUSIONS: Regular exercise reduced blood pressure and left ventricular
      hypertrophy in African-American men with severe hypertension.

      treatment)].
PG  - 1432-4
AB  - The HOT study (hypertension-optimal treatment) is an international clinical study
      on primary prevention of cardiovascular events in 19,193 hypertensive patients
      worldwide. It aims at the recognition of the optimal diastolic blood pressure
      value (< 90, < 85 or < 80 mmHg?) in order to maximize the possible benefit of an 
      antihypertensive therapy. In addition, the HOT study investigates whether low
      doses of aspirin (75 mg/day) are able to reduce the occurrence of severe
      cardiovascular events. In Switzerland a total of 797 patients have been enrolled 
      in the study. Antihypertensive therapy was initiated with felodipine = Plendil (5
      mg/day). This vasoelective calcium antagonist could reduce diastolic blood
      pressure values to < 90 or < 80 mg/Hg, respectively, in one of two or one of
      three patients within the first three months. In nine or six patients,
      respectively out of ten a reduction of diastolic blood pressure values to < 90 or
      < 80 mmHg was reached within one year by combination of felodipine with other
      antihypertensive drugs (ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and diuretics).

TI  - The epidemiology of erectile dysfunction.
PG  - 699-709
AB  - During the last two decades, significant advances have been made in the
      understanding of male sexual dysfunction. Concomitantly, a marked increase in
      both clinical and research activity in the field of male erectile dysfunction has
      led to a better evaluation and more treatment options. The prevalence and
      incidence are dependent on the definitions used, the diagnostic tolls, and the
      treatment options. Using standard definitions as suggested by the NIH Consensus
      Conference and improving our diagnostic and treatment options will have a major
      impact on the epidemiology of ED. A summary of the risk factors for ED is
      presented in Table 3. Still more epidemiologic research is essential to further
      understand the distribution as well as the prevalence of ED in certain ethnic
      groups, chronic conditions, and as a result of surgery and trauma. These studies 
      will help us improve our diagnostic skills as well as our therapeutic options.

TI  - Usefulness of heart rate variability in predicting drug efficacy (metoprolol vs
      diltiazem) in patients with stable angina pectoris.
PG  - 759-63
AB  - We investigated whether analysis of heart rate (HR) variability may be used to
      predict the efficacy of drug treatment of myocardial ischemia. In a double-blind,
      crossover study, 28 patients with stable angina pectoris, proven coronary artery 
      disease, and myocardial ischemia during Holter monitoring received metoprolol
      controlled-release 200 mg once daily and diltiazem 60 mg 4 times daily. After a
      placebo run-in phase and after each treatment period, 72-hour Holter recordings
      were obtained for HR variability and ST-segment analysis. At baseline, the total 
      duration of myocardial ischemia was 11.4 +/- 13.9 minutes (mean +/- SD per 24
      hours), and the total number of episodes was 2.2 +/- 2.3. Metoprolol
      significantly reduced the total duration of ischemia by -8.7 minutes (95% CI
      -14.5 to -2.8) and the total number of episodes by -1.9 (-2.9 to -0.8) in
      patients with a low SD of normal-to-normal intervals at baseline (SDNN), using
      the median value of 50 ms as a cut-off value. In contrast, significant treatment 
      effects were not observed in patients with a high SDNN at baseline. Similar
      results were obtained using baseline total power or low-frequency power, but not 
      when using baseline heart rate. Diltiazem reduced the total duration of ischemia 
      by -4.9 minutes (-9.7 to -0.1), but not the number of episodes. Moreover, in
      contrast to metoprolol, efficacy of diltiazem was not related to baseline HR
      variability. In conclusion, patients with reduced HR variability at baseline
      responded to treatment with metoprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 841-8
AB  - A double-blind, three-period, crossover trial used 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring to compare diltiazem controlled diffusion (CD) 300 mg with
      placebo. Patients with hypertension (N = 43) were randomly assigned to one of
      four crossover treatment sequences of three treatment periods each. Ambulatory
      blood pressure was obtained at the end of each 4-week treatment period. Diltiazem
      CD significantly decreased diastolic and systolic blood pressure at bihourly
      ambulatory blood pressure evaluations (p < 0.05, all). However, when all
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring data were combined into one statistical
      model, blood pressure reductions were quantifiably similar to those in the
      overall bihourly analysis, but with a consistent 24-hour antihypertensive effect 
      for both diastolic and systolic blood pressure relative to that with placebo
      (i.e., parallel blood pressure profiles) and with increased precision. Mean +/-
      SE changes in diastolic and systolic blood pressure across the 24-hour dosing
      interval were -5.6 +/- 0.4 mm Hg and -7.6 +/- 0.5 mm Hg, respectively (p < 0.001,
      both). Therefore, by using a crossover design with ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring, we showed diltiazem CD to reduce blood pressure consistently
      throughout a 24-hour dosing interval in comparison with placebo in patients with 
      hypertension.

TI  - Efficacy of preconditioning with intracoronary diltiazem in preventing
      laser-induced spasm.
PG  - 228-32
AB  - Laser energy produces a multitude of effects, resulting both in therapeutic
      tissue ablation and complications such as laser-induced spasm (LIS). LIS can
      occur during lasing itself or during subsequent adjunctive angioplasty.
      Intracoronary diltiazem (ICD) can partially reverse LIS after it occurs. To
      determine whether pre-treatment with ICD might prevent LIS during laser
      interventions, 3 groups of 50 lesions each were studied. Group 1 served as
      controls receiving no ICD during the procedure. Group 2 received 2.5 mg ICD
      before lasing. Group 3 received ICD before lasing and then a second infusion of
      2.5 mg ICD after lasing but before adjunctive therapy. There were no differences 
      in clinical characteristics of the 3 groups. Over 75% of lesions in each group
      were complex (B2 or C) lesions, and average lesion length was 15 mm in all 3
      groups. Procedural success was > or = 94% in all groups. There was no significant
      difference among groups in pre-procedure artery stenosis, post-procedure
      stenosis, laser power used or number of laser pulses delivered. Pretreatment with
      ICD produced vasodilation of the minimum lumen diameter from 0.86 +/- 0.1 to 1.0 
      +/- 0.1 mm (p < 0.01) and was well tolerated. Control patients exhibited a 12%
      incidence of LIS. Group 2 had an 80% reduction of LIS during lasing (p < 0.01)
      but had increased LIS during adjunctive therapy with the same 12% incidence of
      LIS overall. Group 3 had only a 2% incidence of LIS (p < 0.01). We concluded that
      pretreatment with ICD significantly reduces LIS. Multiple infusions of ICD are
      necessary to sustain this protective effect.

TI  - Effects of gemfibrozil (Lopid) on hyperlipidemia in acitretin-treated patients.
      Results of a double-blind cross-over study.
PG  - 377-80
AB  - Hyperlipidemia is a common side-effect of oral retinoid treatment, which
      sometimes interferes with long-term therapy. To evaluate the safety and efficacy 
      of the lipid-lowering drug gemfibrozil on retinoid-associated hyperlipidemia, we 
      studied the clinical response and the plasma lipoprotein levels in 22
      acitretin-treated (0.25-0.75 mg/kg) patients mainly suffering from psoriasis.
      Gemfibrozil or placebo was given in a double-blind cross-over fashion to 14
      patients, who after 8 weeks of acitretin therapy and dietary advice exhibited
      hyperlipidemia (triglyceride levels > or = 50% above baseline and/or > or = 2.0
      mmol/l). Serum triglycerides remained high (3.7 +/- 2.4 mmol/l) during placebo
      treatment but were reduced after 8 weeks of gemfibrozil treatment (p < 0.01). The
      total cholesterol level decreased slightly (p < 0.05) during gemfibrozil
      treatment, but the LDL/HDL ratio did not change significantly. No untoward
      effects of gemfibrozil on acitretin dose-response and clinical side-effects were 
      noted. Gemfibrozil thus appears useful in patients prone to retinoid-induced
      hyperlipidemia unresponsive to dietary treatment and acitretin dose reductions.

TI  - [Comparison of the antispastic effect of Bi-Tildiem 120 mg and Tildiem 60mg].
PG  - 372-7
AB  - Diltiazem (Tildiem 60 mg) is a calcium channel blocker with demonstrated efficacy
      and safety in the treatment of stable angina pectoris and spastic angina. The
      sustained release formulation of diltiazem, allowing two daily doses (Bi-Tildiem 
      120 mg), is already marketed in France for the treatment of stable angina. It was
      therefore interesting to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this form,
      administered in two daily doses, in coronary spasm, versus the classical
      formulation, Tildiem 60 mg, given at the same daily dose, i.e. 240 mg, in three
      divided doses per day. We conducted a single-centre, randomized, double-blind,
      cross-over clinical study in twelve patients, eleven men and one woman, between
      the ages of 42 and 70 years, presenting with angina and normal coronary arteries 
      and spasm documented by a positive methylergonovine (Methergin) test. They were
      divided into two groups of six patients receiving either Tildiem followed by
      Bi-Tildiem, or Bi-Tildiem followed by Tildiem. The characteristics of the two
      groups were comparable at the time of the selection visit. The methylergonovine
      test, used to assess the efficacy of the two treatments, was improved by Tildiem 
      and Bi-Tildiem compared to the placebo test (p = 0.001 and 0.002), without any
      significant difference between Tildiem and Bi-Tildiem: an improvement was
      obtained in 11/12 and 10/12 patients, respectively. No deterioration of the test 
      was observed with Tildiem or Bi-Tildiem compared to placebo. The coronary
      symptoms and blood diltiazem levels were similar with Tildiem and Bi-Tildiem. The
      results confirmed the safety of Bi-Tildiem. A single adverse effect was
      attributed to treatment: an episode of mild insomnia. No serious adverse effect
      were observed and none of the patients discontinued the study. The efficacy and
      safety of Tildiem and Bi-Tildiem are comparable in the treatment of spastic
      angina.

TI  - The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study: 12-month data on blood pressure
      and tolerability. With special reference to age and gender.
PG  - 313-9
AB  - The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study is an ongoing prospective,
      randomized, multicenter trial conducted in 26 countries. Its two main aims are to
      evaluate the relationship between three levels of target diastolic blood pressure
      (< or = 90, < or = 85 or < or = 80 mmHg) and the incidence of cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients and the effects on morbidity and
      mortality of a low dose, 75 mg daily, of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin)
      compared with placebo. Altogether 19,193 patients have been recruited and
      randomized and one-year data are now available for all patients. This is a report
      on the blood pressures achieved, the tolerability and other available data after 
      12 months of follow-up of all patients. Special reference will be given to the
      subgroup of elderly patients (> or = 65 years, n = 6,113) as compared to younger 
      patients (< 65 years, n = 13,080). On average, the target group < or = 90 mmHg in
      diastolic blood pressure has reached 86 mmHg, the target group < or = 85 mmHg has
      reached 83 mmHg and the target group < or = 80 mmHg has reached 81 mmHg. The
      percentage of patients that has obtained their target blood pressures is 84% in
      the target group < or = 90 mmHg, 72% in the target group < or = 85 mmHg and 57%
      in the target group < or = 80 mmHg at 12 months of follow-up. In the elderly
      subgroup (> or = 65 years of age) the percentage of patients at target is higher 
      for all target groups, being 86, 76 and 61%, respectively, at 12 months.
      Antihypertensive treatment is initiated with a calcium antagonist, felodipine, at
      a dose of 5 mg once daily. If target blood pressure is not reached, additional
      antihypertensive therapy, with either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitor or a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, is given. Further dose
      adjustments are made in accordance with a set protocol. As a fifth and final step
      a diuretic may be added. Side effects have been relatively few in this large
      multinational series of intensively treated hypertensive patients. Only ankle
      edema, 2.6% and 3.0%, and coughing, 1.3% and 0.8%, in young and elderly patients,
      respectively, exceed a frequency of 1%, and 88% of all patients are still taking 
      their baseline therapy felodipine after one year. The one-year data presented
      here indicate that it should be possible to fulfill the primary aims of the HOT
      Study.

TI  - Nifedipine. Dose-related increase in mortality in patients with coronary heart
      disease.
PG  - 1326-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the dose of
      nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on the increased risk of
      mortality seen in the randomized secondary-prevention trials and to review the
      mechanisms by which this adverse effect might occur. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
      restricted the dose-response meta-analysis to the 16 randomized
      secondary-prevention trials of nifedipine for which mortality data were
      available. Recent trials of any calcium antagonist and formulation were also
      reviewed for information about the possible mechanisms of action that might
      increase mortality. Overall, the use of nifedipine was associated with a
      significant adverse effect on total mortality (risk ratio, 1.16, with a 95% CI of
      1.01 to 1.33). This summary estimate fails to draw attention to an important
      dose-response relationship. For daily doses of 30 to 50, 60, and 80 mg, the risk 
      ratios for total mortality were 1.06 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.27), 1.18 (95% CI, 0.93
      to 1.50), and 2.83 (95% CI, 1.35 to 5.93), respectively. In a formal test of dose
      response, the high doses of nifedipine were significantly associated with
      increased mortality (P = .01). While the mechanism of this adverse effect is not 
      known, there are several plausible explanations, including the established
      proischemic effect, negative inotropic effects, marked hypotension, recently
      reported prohemorrhagic effects attributed to antiplatelet and vasodilatory
      actions of calcium antagonists, and possibly proarrhythmic effects. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In patients with coronary disease, the use of short-acting nifedipine in moderate
      to high doses causes an increase in total mortality. Other calcium antagonists
      may have similar adverse effects, in particular those of the dihydropyridine
      type. Long-term safety data are lacking for most calcium antagonists.

TI  - Antianginal and antiischemic efficacy of monotherapy extended-release nisoldipine
      (Coat Core) in chronic stable angina.
PG  - 780-4
AB  - A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted to test the
      peak and trough antianginal and antiischemic monotherapy efficacy and safety of a
      new extended-release formulation of nisoldipine (nisoldipine Coat Core [Bayer
      Corporation], 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg once daily compared to placebo). Study
      patients had a history of chronic, stable angina pectoris, exercise-induced
      angina in association with ST segment depression, and exercise test
      reproducibility. Of the 483 patients enrolled in the study, results were valid
      for safety analysis for 312 and for efficacy analysis for 284. There was a
      statistically significant improvement in total exercise time at both peak and
      trough for patients taking 20 mg and 60 mg of nisoldipine compared with patients 
      taking placebo, but the group taking 60 mg was not better than the group taking
      20 mg (33.9 and 33.7 seconds, respectively, at trough). The results were similar 
      for the secondary endpoints (time to onset of angina and time to 1 mm ST segment 
      depression). No correlation was evident between plasma nisoldipine levels and
      total exercise duration. Headache and peripheral edema were the most frequently
      reported adverse events and were dose related. There were no discontinuations due
      to adverse events in patients randomized to the 20-mg nisoldipine group. No
      deaths occurred while patients were receiving active nisoldipine therapy. Therapy
      with this extended-release formulation of nisoldipine is an effective once-daily 
      treatment for chronic stable angina pectoris. It represents one of the few
      dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists that has shown efficacy when
      administered as monotherapy to patients with angina.

TI  - Addition of zatebradine, a direct sinus node inhibitor, provides no greater
      exercise tolerance benefit in patients with angina taking extended-release
      nifedipine: results of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. The Zatebradine Study Group.
PG  - 305-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the antianginal and anti-ischemic effects of oral
      zatebradine, a direct sinus node inhibitor that has no blood pressure-lowering or
      negative inotropic effects in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris taking
      extended-release nifedipine. BACKGROUND: Heart rate reduction is considered an
      important pharmacologic mechanism for providing anginal pain relief and
      anti-ischemic action in patients with chronic stable angina, suggesting a benefit
      for sinus node-inhibiting drugs. METHODS: In a single-blind placebo run-in,
      randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, patients already 
      receiving extended-release nifedipine (30 to 90 mg once a day) were randomized to
      receive zatebradine (5 mg twice a day [n = 64]) or placebo (n = 60). All subjects
      had reproducible treadmill exercise-induced angina at baseline, and after
      randomization they performed a serial exercise test 3 h after each dose for 4
      weeks. RESULTS: Zatebradine reduced rest heart rate both at 4 weeks ([mean +/-
      SEM] 12.9 +/- 1.23 vs. 2.3 +/- 1.6 [placebo] beats/min, p < 0.0001) and at the
      end of comparable stages of Bruce exercise (16.7 +/- 1.2 vs. 3.4 +/- 1.2
      [placebo] beats/min, p < 0.0001). Despite the significant effects on heart rate
      at rest and exercise, there were no additional benefits of zatebradine from
      placebo baseline in measurements of total exercise duration, time to 1-mm ST
      segment depression or time to onset of angina. Subjects taking zatebradine also
      had more visual disturbances as adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Zatebradine seems
      to provide no additional antianginal benefit to patients already receiving
      nifedipine, and it raises questions regarding the benefit of heart rate reduction
      alone as an antianginal approach to patients with chronic stable angina.

TI  - A crossover comparison of extended release felodipine with prolonged action
      nifedipine in hypertension.
PG  - 154-6
AB  - In a crossover design, control of blood pressure by extended release felodipine
      was compared with control by prolonged action nifedipine in 21 children with
      renal hypertension. Compliance with once daily felodipine was higher than with
      nifedipine, at 95.6 (SEM 2.7)% v 78.9 (6.0)% (p = 0.02). Mean diastolic blood
      pressure was lower during the day with felodipine than with nifedipine, at 77.6
      (2.4) v 84.4 (2.8) mm Hg (p = 0.05). Similarly, blood pressure load (the
      percentage of the day during which the child had blood pressure exceeding the
      upper limits of normal for age) was lower for felodipine than for nifedipine:
      43.5 (5.5)% v 61.3 (6.3)%. There was an opposite trend during the night, though
      this did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that once a day
      felodipine is effective in children with hypertension. This may be because of
      improved compliance.

TI  - [Diltiazem versus intravenous nitroglycerin in the treatment of unstable angina
      pectoris. A randomized study].
PG  - 823-9
AB  - Prognosis of unstable angina pectoris is related to admission EKG changes and
      prompt symptom control. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical effects
      of intravenous diltiazem (DTZ) or nitroglycerin (NTG) in patients with unstable
      angina pectoris. We studied 43 patients admitted to the hospital with a history
      of rest angina within the last 48 hours, associated with EKG evidence of
      ischemia. All subjects received intravenous heparin and oral aspirin, 23 were
      randomly assigned to receive intravenous DTZ and 20 to receive intravenous NTG.
      Both groups had similar baseline features and the endpoints of treatment were
      recurrence of angina, myocardial infarction, death during hospitalization and
      secondary side effects. Treatment with DTZ, when compared to NTG, resulted in a
      significant reduction of recurrent angina (8.7 and 59% respectively; p < 0.005), 
      number of angina episodes per patient (0.18 +/- 0.5 and 0.9 +/- 1.2 respectively;
      p < 0.05) and lower need for dose increment to control symptoms (3 and 9 patients
      respectively; p < 0.05). The most common side effects observed were cephalea with
      NTG (60% of patients) and asymptomatic sinus bradicardia with DTZ (28% of
      patients). In each group, one patient had a myocardial infarction and one patient
      died. It is concluded that intravenous DTZ reduces myocardial ischemia to a
      greater extent than NTG and can be safely used in patients with unstable angina
      pectoris.

      blood-pressure monitoring.
PG  - 234-43
AB  - In this single-blind crossover study the antihypertensive efficacies of two
      dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, sustained-release isradipine and lacidipine,
      were compared using clinic and ambulatory blood-pressure measurements. After a
      2-week placebo wash-out, 34 patients (19 men, 15 women, mean age 49 years) with
      mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure range 95-110 mmHg) were
      treated with 5 mg sustained-release isradipine for 4 weeks and 4 mg lacidipine
      for 4 weeks in a random order. Medications were taken once daily at 08.00 h.
      Clinic and ambulatory blood pressures were recorded at the end of each placebo or
      treatment period. Two patients stopped isradipine and six lacidipine because of
      severe adverse effects. Clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased
      by an average of 17/14 mmHg with isradipine and 17/13 mmHg with lacidipine,
      compared with placebo (P < 0.01 in both cases), without a change in heart rate.
      Mean ambulatory 24-h and daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure were
      significantly reduced by sustained-release isradipine and lacidipine (P < 0.05
      and P < 0.01, respectively). At night systolic blood pressure fell compared with 
      placebo (P < 0.05 with both drugs) whereas the reduction in diastolic blood
      pressure was not statistically significant. Mean 24-h heart rate remained
      unchanged. Blood-pressure variability did not differ significantly between the
      two drugs or between either drug and the placebo. The antihypertensive effects of
      sustained-release isradipine and lacidipine were similar, but the tolerability of
      isradipine appears to be greater since it caused fewer withdrawals.

TI  - Clinical efficacy and safety of once-daily diltiazem in patients with stable

PG  - 85-9
AB  - The maintenance of angina control was assessed in this multicenter (three sites),
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Patients with stable angina
      pectoris receiving twice-daily sustained-release (SR) diltiazem were switched to 
      equivalent doses of once-daily controlled-delivery (CD) diltiazem or to diltiazem
      SR. Patients who were switched from diltiazem SR to diltiazem CD (n = 28)
      experienced a 5% increase in time to termination (p = 0.0004) on the exercise
      tolerance test (ETT), as well as an 8% improvement in time to onset of angina (p 
      < 0.0001) on the ETT. A similar trend was observed in patients randomized to
      diltiazem SR (n = 7), which suggested a training effect, and, therefore, equal
      efficacy between diltiazem SR and diltiazem CD. During exercise testing in the
      diltiazem SR baseline phase, 77% of the patients did not experience angina,
      whereas 60% of the patients did not experience ST-segment depression. Following
      transfer to diltiazem CD, 79 and 61% of patients, respectively, remained angina- 
      and ST-segment depression free. No significant changes in the number of angina
      attacks, nitroglycerin use, or any hemodynamic-related parameters were observed
      following transfer to diltiazem CD. Eleven percent of the patients receiving
      diltiazem CD experienced treatment-related adverse events, which were limited to 
      headache and abdominal pain; these adverse events did not lead to discontinuation
      of treatment. These findings suggest that patients whose angina is controlled
      with twice-daily diltiazem SR can be safely and effectively switched to an
      equivalent daily dose of the once-daily diltiazem CD.

      grafts. Although antithrombotic drugs are recommended, their efficiency under low
      blood flow conditions is still being debated. In this study, we evaluated the
      ability of three drugs to modify the thrombotic properties of blood and,
      consequently, to influence platelet and fibrin deposition on the luminal surface 
      of polyester arterial prostheses. In dogs receiving saline (control, n = 10),
      heparin (100 U/kg, n = 5), aspirin (325 mg, n = 5), or prostacyclin (15
      ng/kg/min, n = 5), a 30-cm, woven, loop-shaped, DeBakey arterial prosthesis was
      implanted as a substitute for the infrarenal aorta and exposed to reduced blood
      flow (50 ml/min) for 4 h. The parameters of the blood measured included activated
      clotting time (ACT) and platelet aggregation with collagen, determined before and
      after each treatment. Blood deposits were quantified using 111In labeled
      platelets and 125I-labeled fibrinogen. The ACT was significantly prolonged only
      after heparin treatment, and platelet aggregation, which was decreased by 35% (p 
      < 0.05) after heparin treatment, was almost abolished after aspirin and
      prostacyclin treatments. As compared with the control group, both platelet and
      fibrin uptake on the luminal surface of the prostheses were reduced significantly
      by heparin by 87 and 37%, respectively. Despite their inhibition of platelet
      aggregation in vitro, aspirin and prostacyclin induced no significant change in
      platelet and fibrin deposition on the luminal surface of the woven polyester
      arterial prostheses under low blood flow conditions. Under such conditions,
      however, thrombin generation with subsequent platelet-fibrin deposition was
      prevented by use of heparin anticoagulant therapy.

      double-blind cross-sectional random study.
PG  - 535-40
AB  - We evaluated the systemic haemodynamic alterations induced by slow-release
      nifedipine administered to elderly hypertensive patients, 20 mg twice daily by
      the oral route for 4 weeks. A non-invasive chest electrical bio-impedance method 
      was used to detect changes in stroke volume and cardiac output. The random,
      double-blind, crossover study showed variations in measurements made in the
      supine and in the standing position: delta -18.0% (P < 0.001) and delta -14.9% (P
      < 0.001) for mean arterial pressure; delta -16.5% (P < 0.01) and delta -34.9% (P 
      < 0.01) for total peripheral resistance; and delta +8.1% (P < 0.05) and delta
      +12.6% (P < 0.01) for heart rate, respectively. In contrast, cardiac output and
      stroke volume were the same when measured in the supine and standing positions
      both when compared with the placebo period and when compared with each other. We 
      conclude that slow-release nifedipine is effective in reducing systemic blood
      pressure levels of elderly subjects and that this phenomenon occurs without
      reductions in cardiac output.

TI  - Factors determining the blood pressure response to enalapril and nifedipine in
      hypertension associated with NIDDM.
PG  - 1001-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors that determine the blood pressure response to
      enalapril and nifedipine monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension associated 
      with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: After a 6-week placebo baseline period, 102 hypertensive NIDDM patients 
      were randomly assigned, double-blindly, to treatment with nifedipine retard (slow
      release) (n = 52) or enalapril (n = 50). The daily dosage of enalapril was
      increased, if required, from 10 to 20 to 40 mg and that of nifedipine from 40 to 
      60 to 80 mg at 4-week intervals during the 12-week titration period. Blood
      pressure, 24-h urinary albumin excretion (UAE), biochemical data, and serum
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity were measured at weeks -6, -4, 0, 4,
      8, and 12. At week 0, venous blood was also sampled for baseline plasma atrial
      natriuretic peptide, renin, aldosterone, and serum insulin concentrations.
      RESULTS: At week 12, the mean daily dose of enalapril was 35 +/- 11.4 mg, and 27 
      (57%) patients were receiving the maximum daily dose of 40 mg. In the nifedipine 
      group, the mean daily drug dose was 50 +/- 12.9 mg, and 4 (8%) were receiving the
      maximum daily dose of 80 mg. Despite a dose-dependent fall in the serum ACE
      activity in the enalapril group, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced by 
      only 8 mmHg throughout the 12-week titration period compared to a decline of 15, 
      18, and 19 mmHg at weeks 0, 4, and 12, respectively, in the nifedipine group (P =
      0.01 between groups). In the enalapril group, changes in MAP between weeks 0 and 
      12 correlated significantly with baseline plasma glucose (r = 0.45, P = 0.001)
      and aldosterone concentrations (r = -0.32, P = 0.02) and UAE (r = 0.3, P = 0.04).
      There was no statistically significant correlation between the changes in MAP and
      baseline plasma renin concentration. On multivariate analysis, the baseline renal
      function, glycemic control, and plasma aldosterone and serum insulin
      concentrations were all independently related to the changes in blood pressure in
      the enalapril-treated patients. No such statistical associations were observed in
      the nifedipine group. CONCLUSIONS: In hypertensive NIDDM patients, the activity
      of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the level of serum insulin, glycemic
      control, renal function, and proteinuria may be important determinants of the
      blood pressure response to ACE inhibition. Good glycemic control may optimize the
      antihypertensive efficacy of concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy.

TI  - Time-dependent effect of isradipine on the nocturnal hypertension in chronic
      renal failure.
PG  - 719-26
AB  - Nocturnal hypertension is frequently observed in chronic renal failure and
      contributes to the risk of target organ damages. We assessed whether
      antihypertensive therapy may restore a nocturnal blood pressure (BP) fall in this
      condition. A sustained-release oral formulation (SRO) of isradipine was used, and
      the possible differences in the response to morning nu evening dosing were also
      investigated. Sixteen hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure due to
      parenchymal kidney disease were studied after 2 weeks of single-blind placebo
      runin. According to the double-blind, randomized, cross-over design, they
      received 5 mg isradipine SRO at 08:00, or at 20:00 for 4 weeks, separated by a
      single-blind placebo period of 2 weeks. A 24-h BP monitoring at 10-min intervals 
      was carried out at the end of each treatment using a SpaceLabs 90207 instrument. 
      Under placebo, blunt BP profiles were observed, whereas HR showed a mean
      nocturnal fall of 17.4%, which remained unaltered after isradipine. Both
      isradipine treatments were equally effective in reducing the mean 24-h BP levels.
      However, the evening regimen showed a more pronounced effect during the night.
      The mean nocturnal fall in systolic/diastolic BP represented 4.8/8.7% and
      7.5/10.9% of the corresponding daytime mean after morning and evening dosing,
      respectively. Only the evening administration reset the normal synchronization of
      the 24-h BP and HR profiles. Our findings demonstrate that antihypertensive
      treatment may restore a nocturnal BP fall in renal patients. An evening regimen
      of isradipine SRO seems more apt than a morning regimen to obtain this
      therapeutic goal.

TI  - Differential effects of felodipine and nifedipine on 24-h blood pressure and left
      ventricular mass.
PG  - 712-8
AB  - 1,4-Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, which have a rapid onset and short
      duration of action, tend to increase sympathetic activity, which may limit the
      regression of left ventricular hypertrophy when used for the treatment of
      hypertension. This study compares the effects of the shorter-acting formulation
      of nifedipine (PA) with longer-acting felodipine (ER) on 24-h blood pressure and 
      left ventricular mass in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension.
      Subjects were randomly allocated to receive nifedipine (n = 52) or felodipine (n 
      = 56) over 8 weeks at increasing doses until the sitting office diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP) was < 90 mm Hg. An ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) recording and
      echocardiogram were performed at baseline and upon completion of the study. At
      the end of the dosing interval, felodipine lowered office DBP (mm Hg) by -18 +/- 
      12/14 +/- 1 compared to -14 +/- 2/11 +/- 1 for nifedipine (P < or = .05). Mean
      24-h ABP was reduced (P < .001) by felodipine (-15 +/- 1/-10 +/- 1 mm Hg) and
      nifedipine (-15 +/- 1/-9 +/- 2 mm Hg). However, nifedipine caused an apparent
      biphasic response with felodipine reducing (P < .05) blood pressure more in the
      early afternoon compared to nifedipine. Left ventricular mass index was
      significantly reduced (P < .01) by felodipine (-6 +/- 1 g/m2), but not by
      nifedipine. Once-daily administration of felodipine achieves a more consistent
      control of blood pressure compared to twice-daily nifedipine and may be
      associated with a greater reduction in left ventricular mass.

TI  - Placebo-controlled evaluation of three doses of a controlled-onset,
      extended-release formulation of verapamil in the treatment of stable angina
      pectoris.
PG  - 1102-6
AB  - This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study was
      designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new controlled-onset,
      extended-release formulation of verapamil hydrochloride called physiologic
      pattern release (PPR) verapamil. The study was conducted at 24 sites (13 United
      States, 5 Canada, 6 overseas; see Appendix). Following a 1- to 3-week
      single-blind placebo lead-in period, 278 patients with chronic stable angina
      pectoris (247 males, 31 females, mean age 60.8 years, range 32 to 78) were
      randomly assigned to 1 of 4 once-daily, fixed-dose treatment groups: verapamil
      180, 360, or 540 mg, or placebo. PPR verapamil at all doses significantly
      increased (p < 0.05) time to moderate angina and symptom-limited exercise
      duration, and verapamil 360 mg significantly increased (p < 0.05) time to > or = 
      1 mm ST-segment depression, after 4 weeks of treatment when assessed 24 hour
      after the previous dose. Larger doses of verapamil were associated with
      proportionately greater improvements in exercise tolerance. Frequency of anginal 
      attacks was also reduced by verapamil. The most frequently observed adverse
      events were dizziness, headache, constipation, and nausea. The incidence of
      constipation was high (20.9%) within the 540 mg treatment group. This verapamil
      formulation can be clinically titrated within a 180 to 540 mg dosing range,
      permitting effective once-daily administration for the treatment of chronic
      stable angina.

TI  - Selection of medical treatment in stable angina pectoris: results of the
      International Multicenter Angina Exercise (IMAGE) Study.
PG  - 1516-21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to investigate which characteristics
      of anginal symptoms or exercise test results could predict the favorable
      anti-ischemic effect of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol and the
      calcium antagonist nifedipine in patients with stable angina pectoris.
      BACKGROUND: The characteristics of anginal symptoms and the results of exercise
      testing are considered of great importance for selecting medical treatment in
      patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. However, little information is
      available on how this first evaluation may be used to select the best
      pharmacologic approach in individual patients. METHODS: In this prospective
      multicenter study, 280 patients with stable angina pectoris were enrolled in 25
      European centers. After baseline evaluation, consisting of an exercise test and a
      questionnaire investigating patients' anginal symptoms, the patients were
      randomly allocated to double-blind treatment for 6 weeks with either metoprolol
      (Controlled Release, 200 mg once daily) or nifedipine (Retard, 20 mg twice daily)
      according to a parallel group design. At the end of this period, exercise tests
      were repeated 1 to 4 h after drug intake. RESULTS: Both metoprolol and nifedipine
      prolonged exercise tolerance over baseline levels; the improvement was greater in
      the patients receiving metoprolol (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that
      low exercise tolerance was the only variable associated with a more favorable
      effect within each treatment group. Metoprolol was more effective than nifedipine
      in patients with a lower exercise tolerance or with a higher rate-pressure
      product at rest and at ischemic threshold. None of the characteristics of anginal
      symptoms or exercise test results predicted a greater efficacy of nifedipine over
      metoprolol. CONCLUSIONS: The results of a baseline exercise test, but not the
      characteristics of anginal symptoms, may offer useful information for selecting
      medical treatment in stable angina pectoris.

PG  - 494-9
AB  - A factorial design was applied in this multicenter, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of the calcium-channel blocker verapamil and the ACE
      inhibitor enalapril to assess the hypotensive effects of the combination compared
      with monotherapy, to evaluate safety, and to determine the effects on quality of 
      life (QOL) of both drugs, alone and in combination. The study consisted of a 3 x 
      2 factorial design wherein 186 men and women with a sitting diastolic blood
      pressure (BP) of between 95 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg, after a 4-week placebo washout, 
      were randomized to one of six treatment groups for 4 weeks of active treatment.
      Monotherapy with both 240 mg verapamil and 10 mg enalapril reduced systolic and
      diastolic BP to a similar extent and significantly more than placebo. The 240 mg 
      verapamil + 10 mg enalapril combination was additive for both systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure; 120 mg verapamil + 10 mg enalapril was additive for
      systolic BP only. The total number of adverse events reported was similar for all
      six treatment groups. QOL scores were unchanged from baseline and not different
      between treatment groups. The combination of 240 mg verapamil and 10 mg enalapril
      was significantly more effective at reducing BP than either drug alone; this
      additivity of effect was not linked to a higher rate of adverse experiences or to
      a deterioration in QOL. Thus, combination therapy at lower doses may offer an
      alternative treatment option to higher dose monotherapy.

PG  - 191-9
AB  - Twelve patients with refractory chronic congestive heart failure (Class IV NYHA),
      related to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (10 patients); previous myocardial
      infarction (one patient) and peripartum cardiomyopathy (one patient), received
      Terminalia Arjuna, an Indian medicinal plant, as bark extract (500 mg 8-hourly)
      or matching placebo for 2 weeks each, separated by 2 weeks washout period, in a
      double blind cross over design as an adjuvent to maximally tolerable conventional
      therapy (Phase I). The clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic evaluation was 
      carried out at baseline and at the end of Terminalia Arjuna and placebo therapy
      and results were compared. Terminalia Arjuna, compared to placebo, was associated
      with improvement in symptoms and signs of heart failure, improvement in NYHA
      Class (Class III vs. Class IV), decrease in echo-left ventricular enddiastolic
      (125.28 +/- 27.91 vs. 134.56 +/- 29.71 ml/m2; P < 0.005) and endsystolic volume
      (81.06 +/- 24.60 vs. 94.10 +/- 26.42 ml/m2; P < 0.005) indices, increase in left 
      ventricular stroke volume index (44.21 +/- 11.92 vs. 40.45 +/- 11.56 ml/m2; P <
      0.05) and increase in left ventricular ejection fractions (35.33 +/- 7.85 vs.
      30.24 +/- 7.13%; P < 0.005). On long term evaluation in an open design (Phase
      II), wherein Phase I participants continued Terminalia Arjuna in fixed dosage
      (500 mg 8-hourly) in addition to flexible diuretic, vasodilator and digitalis
      dosage for 20-28 months (mean 24 months) on outpatient basis, patients showed
      continued improvement in symptoms, signs, effort tolerance and NYHA Class, with
      improvement in quality of life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Three-month efficacy and safety of once-daily diltiazem in chronic stable angina 
      pectoris.
PG  - 555-8
AB  - The 3-month efficacy and safety of a once-daily controlled formulation of
      diltiazem (180 to 360 mg/day) were assessed in a study of 54 patients with angina
      pectoris. This multicenter study was a nonrandomized, placebo run-in, open-label,
      3-month trial followed by a 1-week, double-blind, randomized period during which 
      most patients (89%) received placebo. There were only minimal changes in the time
      to termination (mean change +/- SEM -5.8 +/- 9.6 seconds), time to onset of
      angina (10.5 +/- 12.2 seconds), and the time to 1 mm ST-segment depression (2.9
      +/- 12.5 seconds) from the end of the titration phase to the end of the
      open-label study. There were, however, statistically significant differences
      between the end of the 3-month treatment phase and the end of the 1-week
      randomized placebo phase for those 3 efficacy parameters (-37.3 +/- 11.2, -58.6
      +/- 13.6, and -45.6 +/- 16.4 seconds, respectively). Diltiazem significantly
      decreased the frequency of anginal attacks and nitroglycerin use at the end of
      the 3-month treatment phase compared with results at the end of the randomized
      double-blind placebo phase. No new or unusual adverse events were reported during
      treatment. The present results suggest that there is no loss of efficacy of
      once-a-day diltiazem when administered for a long period to patients with chronic
      stable angina pectoris.

TI  - Amlodipine in chronic stable angina: results of a multicenter double-blind
      crossover trial.
PG  - 527-35
AB  - The efficacy and safety of amlodipine, 10 mg, a new long-acting calcium
      antagonist, was compared with placebo in 103 patients with stable angina pectoris
      in a multicenter double-blind crossover study. The trial consisted of an initial 
      2-week single-blind placebo period followed by a first period of 4 weeks of
      double-blind therapy, which was followed by a 1 week washout period and then a
      second 4-week double-blind period after treatments were crossed over.
      Twenty-four-hour Holter electrocardiographic monitoring was carried out in 12
      patients at three centers. In the first double-blind period amlodipine produced a
      significantly greater increase in symptom-limited exercise duration (amlodipine
      478.5 to 520.6 vs placebo 484.6 to 485.2 seconds; change +8.8% vs +0.1%,
      respectively; p = 0.0004) and total work (amldipine 2426 to 2984 vs placebo 2505 
      to 2548 kilopondmeters; change +24% vs +1.7%, respectively; p = 0.0006) and a
      decrease in angina attack frequency (from 3 to 1 per week; p = 0.016) and
      nitroglycerin consumption (from 2 to 0.5 tablets/wk; p = 0.01) compared with
      placebo. Holter monitoring revealed significant reductions in numbers (amlodipine
      4.65 to 2.22 vs placebo 1.84 to 1.54; change -52% vs +84%, respectively; p =
      0.06), absolute total area (amlodipine 87.66 to 11.43 vs placebo 5.76 to 35.24;
      change -87% vs +513%, respectively; p = 0.02), and duration (amlodipine 12.29 to 
      2.95 vs 1.66 to 7.74 seconds; change -76% vs +367%, respectively; p = 0.008) of
      ST-segment depressions after treatment with amlodipine compared with placebo.
      After the treatments were crossed over changes continued to favor
      amlodipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Effect of amlodipine, atenolol and their combination on myocardial ischemia
      during treadmill exercise and ambulatory monitoring. Canadian Amlodipine/Atenolol
      in Silent Ischemia Study (CASIS) Investigators.
PG  - 619-25
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study compared the effects of amlodipine, atenolol and their
      combination on ischemia during treadmill testing and 48-h ambulatory monitoring. 
      BACKGROUND: It is not known whether anti-ischemic drugs exert similar effects on 
      ischemia during ambulatory monitoring and exercise treadmill testing. METHODS:
      Patients with stable coronary artery disease and ischemia during treadmill
      testing and ambulatory monitoring were randomized to receive amlodipine (n = 51) 
      or atenolol (n = 49). Each group underwent a counterbalanced, crossover
      evaluation of single drug and placebo, followed by evaluation of the combination.
      RESULTS: Amlodipine and the combination prolonged exercise time to 0.1-mV ST
      segment depression by 29% and 34%, respectively (p < 0.001) versus 3% for
      atenolol (p = NS). During ambulatory monitoring, the frequency of ischemic
      episodes decreased by 28% with amlodipine (p = 0.083 [NS]), by 57% with atenolol 
      (p < 0.001) and by 72% with the combination (p < 0.05 vs. both single drugs; p < 
      0.001 vs. placebo). Suppression of ischemia during exercise testing and
      ambulatory monitoring was similar in patients with and without exercise-induced
      angina. Exercise time to angina improved by 29% with amlodipine (p < 0.01), by
      16% with atenolol (p < 0.05) and by 39% with the combination (p < 0.005 vs.
      placebo, atenolol and amlodipine). In patients with angina, total exercise time
      improved by 16% with amlodipine (p < 0.001), by 4% with atenolol (p = NS) and by 
      19% with the combination (p < 0.05 vs. placebo and either single drug). In those 
      patients without angina, no therapy significantly improved total exercise time.
      CONCLUSIONS: Ischemia during treadmill testing was more effectively suppressed by
      amlodipine, whereas ischemia during ambulatory monitoring was more effectively
      suppressed by atenolol. The combination was more effective than either single
      drug in both settings.

      diltiazem formulation in stable angina: a placebo-controlled trial. The Dildurang
      Study Group.
PG  - 277-82
AB  - 1. This placebo-controlled study assessed once daily sustained-release (SR)
      diltiazem, 200 and 300 mg, in 182 stable angina patients with positive exercise
      test. 2. Exercise testing was performed at baseline after a 7 day placebo run-in 
      period, and repeated after 7 days of treatment, 25.0 +/- 0.1 h postdose. 3.
      Diltiazem (200 and 300 mg) produced respectively a 68% and a 64% decrease in
      weekly angina episodes, and placebo a 15% decrease (P < 0.05). Similarly, both
      dose levels produced a 70% decrease in nitroglycerin consumption, whereas no
      difference was obtained with placebo (P < 0.01). The increase in time to
      ischaemic threshold was significantly superior for 200 mg and 300 mg diltiazem
      when compared with placebo (75.2 and 91.5 s respectively vs 47.0 s) (P < 0.05);
      increase in time to anginal threshold was also significantly greater for
      diltiazem when compared with placebo (84.6 and 85.9 s respectively vs 43.9 s) (P 
      < 0.05). 4. Only one patient experienced worsening of angina and had to be
      withdrawn from the study. 5. This study demonstrates 200 and 300 mg SR diltiazem 
      is effective when given once-a-day in the prophylaxis of stable exertional
      angina. This once daily formulation should improve patients' compliance and
      comfort.

TI  - Comparison of efficacy of nisoldipine, metoprolol, and isosorbide dinitrate in
      patients with stable exertional angina: a randomized, cross-over,
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 131-7
AB  - We evaluated the acute antianginal effect of oral nisoldipine (10 mg), metoprolol
      (40 mg), and long-acting isosorbide dinitrate (20 mg) in 15 patients with stable 
      exertional angina. The patients performed symptom-limited treadmill exercise at 2
      h after the administration of placebo (Placebo stages 1 and 2) and each of the
      active drugs. After Placebo stage 1, the patients were randomized for cross-over 
      evaluation of the acute effect of a single oral dose of placebo (Placebo stage
      2), nisoldipine, metoprolol, or long-acting isosorbide dinitrate. All 15 patients
      developed angina during all of exercise tests and their exercise tests were
      terminated at the onset of angina. The time until development of 0.1 mV ST
      segment depression was increased by all three drugs compared to placebo, and it
      was significantly longer with metoprolol than with isosorbide dinitrate.
      Similarly, the time to ceasing exercise because of angina was also prolonged by
      all three drugs. The exercise time was longer with nisoldipine and metoprolol
      compared to isosorbide dinitrate, but there was no significant difference between
      nisoldipine and metoprolol. In conclusion, metoprolol and nisoldipine more
      effectively prolonged exercise compared to long-acting isosorbide dinitrate in
      patients with stable exertional angina.

      stable angina.
PG  - 189-95
AB  - A double-blind safety and efficacy dose-ranging study was conducted with a new,
      once-daily, extended-release (XR) diltiazem hydrochloride formulation (Dilacor
      XR, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Collegeville, PA) in 189 patients with chronic stable
      angina pectoris. After a 2-week placebo lead-in phase, the patients were randomly
      assigned to 1 of 4 once-daily, fixed-dose treatment groups: placebo, XR diltiazem
      120 mg, 240 mg, or 480 mg. Extended-release diltiazem, at 240-mg and 480-mg
      once-daily doses, significantly improved (P < .05) total exercise time during
      treadmill exercise tolerance testing after 2 weeks of treatment when assessed 24 
      hours after the previous dose. These increasing doses of XR diltiazem were
      associated with incremental improvements in exercise tolerance. Outpatient
      function, as assessed by frequency of anginal attacks, nitroglycerin use, and
      ambulatory electrocardiogram (Holter, Scole Engineering Culver City, CA)
      monitoring of ischemic events, was also improved by XR diltiazem. This
      extended-release diltiazem formulation can be clinically titrated within the 120-
      to 480-mg dosing range, permitting effective once-daily administration for
      treating chronic stable angina.

      double-blind comparison with nifedipine, twice daily, and placebo in patients
      with stable exercise induced angina pectoris.
PG  - 171-6
AB  - The effects, as monotherapy, of felodipine ER 10 mg o.m. and nifedipine SR 20 mg 
      b.d. were compared in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way
      cross-over trial in 43 patients with stable exercise-induced angina pectoris. The
      exercise tests were performed at the end of dosage interval (i.e. 24 h after
      felodipine ER, 12 h after nifedipine SR) and at the expected peak time of 3 h
      post dose. Felodipine and nifedipine improved exercise duration by 66 and 50 s,
      respectively, (P < 0.001) compared with placebo at the end of the dosing
      interval. Time to the end of exercise showed no statistically significant
      difference between the two calcium antagonists. The onset of anginal pain and
      time to 1 mm ST depression were significantly more delayed by felodipine ER than 
      nifedipine SR (22 s and 19 s, respectively, P < 0.05). Both felodipine and
      nifedipine decreased the pain score and rate pressure product at the highest
      comparable work load. Overall tolerability was good for both drugs.

      heart failure.
PG  - 95-102
AB  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled multicentre study with
      spirapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), has been
      conducted in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) of NYHA classes
      II-IV. After a placebo run-in period of 1-4 weeks, patients were randomly
      assigned to one of five treatment groups: placebo (n = 48), spirapril 1.5 mg (n =
      48), spirapril 3 mg (n = 53), spirapril 6 mg (n = 51) or enalapril 5/10 mg (n =
      48). The primary objective was to assess changes in exercise tolerance, and the
      secondary objective was an assessment of cardiovascular signs and symptoms,
      quality of life, ejection fraction and chest X-ray findings. Exercise tolerance
      increased in all groups; however, no statistically significant differences were
      found between any of the groups. There was a statistically significant reduction 
      of mortality in the pooled spirapril groups compared with placebo, and a trend
      for reduction of serious cardiovascular adverse events as well as duration of
      hospitalization. These effects and improvements in lung congestion appeared to be
      dose dependent. In patients with moderate to severe heart failure, the
      combination with first-generation calcium channel blockers had an unfavourable
      effect on exercise capacity and clinical parameters. Spirapril might be an
      effective alternative to enalapril in the treatment of patients with CHF. The
      role of the exercise tolerance test in establishing efficacy of ACEIs in CHF and 
      the widespread use of nifedipine in CHF is questioned.

PG  - 27-30
AB  - Two preparations of diltiazem, controlled release (CR) given twice a day (b.i.d.)
      and plain given 4 times a day (q.i.d.), were compared in a multicentre,
      double-blind, crossover study in 41 patients with stable angina pectoris.
      Therapeutic efficacy was assessed with maximal exercise tests, patient recordings
      on nitroglycerine consumption and angina attacks. No significant differences
      between the CR and plain tablets were seen in any of the efficacy variables.
      Maximal workload significantly increased from 127 W on placebo to 146 W on CR
      tablets and to 147 W on plain tablets. Anginal attacks/week significantly
      decreased from 11.7 on placebo to 4.9 on CR tablets and to 5.0 on plain tablets. 
      Consumption of nitroglycerine tablets/week significantly decreased from 6.3 on
      placebo to 2.6 and to 3.4 on CR and plain-tablets, respectively. The number or
      the seriousness of the adverse events did not differ between the groups. The
      results imply that diltiazem CR b.i.d. is equally potent and safe as conventional
      diltiazem q.i.d. in the control of stable angina pectoris.

TI  - [Adenosine triphosphate in the treatment of supraventricular paroxysmal
      tachycardia: a comparison with verapamil].
PG  - 55-8
AB  - AIMS: There are multiple drugs options in the treatment of Paroxysmal
      Supraventricular Tachycardia (PST) after inefficacious vagal stimulus. In this
      study we compare two of these treatments: verapamil versus adenosin triphosphate 
      (ATP). METHODS: Fifty patients with PST were randomly treated with either
      Verapamil (5 to 10 mg) or ATP (5 to 20 mg). The basal features of each group, and
      the efficacy and safety of the two drugs were compared. Verapamil failures were
      treated with ATP and vice versa. RESULTS: The characteristics of both groups of
      treatment were similar. 86% of PST episodes were resolved with Verapamil use,
      versus 83% after ATP administration. Finally all patients were successfully
      treated with these drugs. No adverse effects were observed with Verapamil,
      whereas these effects were frequent with ATP use, but in any case requiring
      specific intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Both Verapamil and aTP are an equally safe
      and effective treatment of PST, but transient and minor side effects are frequent
      after ATP administration.

TI  - Medical treatment to reduce total ischemic burden: total ischemic burden
      bisoprolol study (TIBBS), a multicenter trial comparing bisoprolol and
      nifedipine. The TIBBS Investigators.
PG  - 231-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of bisoprolol on transient myocardial
      ischemia with those of nifedipine in patients with chronic stable angina.
      BACKGROUND: Both beta-adrenergic blocking agents and calcium antagonists reduce
      transient ischemic episodes, but comparisons of these agents have been made in
      only a few larger studies. METHODS: The Total Ischemic Burden Bisoprolol Study
      (TIBBS) was a randomized double-blind controlled study with two parallel groups; 
      330 patients from 30 centers in seven European countries with stable angina
      pectoris, a positive exercise test and more than two transient ischemic episodes 
      during 48 h of Holter monitoring (central evaluation) were included. Of these
      patients 161 were randomized to receive bisoprolol and 169 to receive nifedipine 
      slow release. There were two treatment phases of 4 weeks each, with 48-h Holter
      monitoring after each phase. During phase 1, patients received either 10 mg of
      bisoprolol daily or 2 x 20 mg of nifedipine slow release. During phase 2, they
      received either 20 mg of bisoprolol daily or 2 x 40 mg of nifedipine slow
      release. RESULTS: In phase 1 of the trial, 4 weeks of bisoprolol therapy (10 mg
      daily) reduced the mean [+/- SD] number of transient ischemic episodes from 8.1
      +/- 0.6 to 3.2 +/- 0.4/48 h. Nifedipine (2 x 20 mg) reduced transient ischemic
      episodes from 8.3 +/- 0.5 to 5.9 +/- 0.4/48 h. Total duration of ischemia was
      reduced from 99.3 +/- 10.1 to 31.9 +/- 5.5 min/48 h with bisoprolol and from 101 
      +/- 9.1 to 72.6 +/- 8.1 min/48 h with nifedipine. Reductions were statistically
      significant for both drugs; the difference between bisoprolol and nifedipine was 
      also significant (p < 0.0001). Bisoprolol reduced the heart rate at onset of
      episodes by 13.7 +/- 1.4 beats/min from a baseline value of 99.5 +/- 1.2
      beats/min (p < 0.001). Heart rate was unchanged with nifedipine. Bisoprolol had
      significantly higher responder rates than nifedipine. Doubling of the dose in
      phase 2 of the trial had small additive effects. Only bisoprolol showed a marked 
      circadian effect by reducing the morning peak of transient ischemic episodes (by 
      68% at peak time, 8:00 to 8:59 AM). CONCLUSIONS: Both bisoprolol and nifedipine
      reduced the number and duration of transient ischemic episodes in patients with
      chronic stable angina. Bisoprolol was significantly more effective than
      nifedipine in both doses tested and reduced the morning peak of ischemic
      activity.

      administered once daily in patients with stable angina.
PG  - 493-6
AB  - The aim of this multicentre randomised double blind study was to compare the
      efficacy and safety of the 200-300 mg sustained release diltiazem formulation
      administered once daily (200-300 SR) with standard diltiazem (D) given three or
      four times daily to patients with stable angina. Patients aged 59 years, with a
      reproducible exercise test on placebo, were randomised to 4 weeks of treatment
      with 200-300 SR (n = 70) or D (n = 74). The initial dosage was 200 mg in the
      200-300 SR group and 60 mg t.i.d. in the D group, increased to 300 mg once daily 
      or 60 mg q.i.d., respectively, if ergometric parameters, which were always
      measured at the end of the dosing period, had not improved after two weeks. After
      4 weeks of treatment, the antianginal efficacy at rest was comparable in the
      200-300 SR and the D group; there was a prolongation of the total duration of
      exertion of 14% and 18% respectively (P < 0.01 vs placebo for both groups with no
      intergroup difference). A dose-effect relation was found with both formulations. 
      The 200-300 SR formulation gave full 24 hour anti-ischaemic protection when
      administered once daily. Its efficacy and safety were comparable to those of
      standard diltiazem t.i.d. or q.i.d. in patients with stable angina. The once
      daily administration should improve treatment compliance.

TI  - Intravenous administration of diltiazem in the treatment of supraventricular
      tachyarrhythmias.
PG  - 125-34
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of diltiazem bolus
      intravenous administration, compared to disopyramide, in the treatment of various
      types of paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. METHOD: Fifty patients (23
      males, 27 females, mean age 47.7 +/- 15.2 years) with paroxysmal supraventricular
      tachyarrhythmia (20 with paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, 23 with paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation and rapid ventricular response and 7 with atrial fluttering) were
      studied. Diltiazem at a dose of 0.25-0.30 mg/kg BW or disopyramide at a dose of
      50 mg were given bolus IV. If conversion of the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm could 
      not be achieved with the initial drug, the alternate was given. The order of
      administration of the drugs was random, independent of the type of the
      arrhythmia. Before and during drug administration detailed clinical examination
      and frequent blood pressure (BP) measurements were performed. Twenty-four hour
      Holter monitoring was done in all patients, starting with the administration of
      the antiarrhythmic drug. RESULTS: 1) Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia: diltiazem
      administration converted the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm in all patients while
      disopyramide in only 1 of 9 patients who received this drug. 2) Paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation: disopyramide converted the arrhythmia in 5 patients without
      significant change in ventricular response in the others. Diltiazem did not
      convert the arrhythmia though it caused significant decrease in ventricular
      response (< 100 bpm) and in 1 patient an important bradycardia (45 bpm). 3)
      Atrial fluttering: disopyramide converted the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm in 1
      patient without significant change in the ventricular response in the others.
      Diltiazem caused significant decrease in the ventricular response without
      conversion to sinus rhythm. During conversion to sinus rhythm an AV junctional
      rhythm of short duration (< 1 min) was noticed in 5 patients and a short pause (<
      2 sec) with or without an initial premature contraction in the remaining 21.
      Disopyramide administration was not associated with side effects. Diltiazem
      administration cause small (< 20 mm Hg), transient (< 30 min) decrease of BP
      without symptoms with the exception of the patient with bradycardia in whom the
      BP decrease was significant (90/60 from 160/80 mm Hg) followed by intense
      symptoms which lasted for six hours. CONCLUSIONS: Diltiazem administration is
      extremely effective in conversion of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia to sinus
      rhythm. In addition it retards ventricular response in patients with atrial
      fibrillation and fluttering. Compared to disopyramide these effects of diltiazem 
      are more pronounced and clinically pertinent.

PG  - 481-7
AB  - This study assessed once-daily sustained-release (o.d. SR) diltiazem in essential
      hypertension; 158 patients with supine diastolic blood pressures (BP) of 95-115
      mm Hg were randomized to 200 mg diltiazem or placebo, then optimally titrated, at
      2-week intervals, to 200, 300 or 400 mg to achieve supine diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg
      or a > or = 10 mm Hg fall from baseline. BP was measured at trough level, 24 h
      after dosing. After 2 weeks at the dose of 200 mg, supine diastolic BP was
      significantly reduced (from 101 to 92 mm Hg) compared with placebo (from 101 to
      98 mm Hg; p < 0.001), and yielded 57% of responders with diltiazem against 22%
      with placebo (p < 0.001). Titration allowed supine diastolic BP normalization
      with diltiazem (88 mm Hg) compared with placebo (93 mm Hg; p < 0.001) and yielded
      78% of responders with diltiazem against 37% with placebo (p < 0.01). The safety 
      profile was similar to placebo. 200 and 300 mg o.d. SR diltiazem formulations
      enable safe and close regimen adjustments in mild-to-moderate essential
      hypertension.

TI  - [Comparison of vascular effects of magnesium sulfate and nicardipine during
      extracorporeal circulation].
PG  - 149-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that magnesium sulphate (SO4Mg), usually
      administered for protecting the myocardium and decreasing the rate of arrhythmias
      in cardiac surgery, was able to control the hypertensive peaks occurring during
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), as efficiently as nicardipine (N). STUDY DESIGN:
      Randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS: Forty patients were allocated into two
      groups when hypertensive peaks occurred during CPB. The patients of the N group
      were then given nicardipine 0.016 mg.kg-1 and those of the SO4Mg group received
      magnesium sulphate 50 mg.kg-1. METHODS: Anaesthesia technique was identical and
      during normothermic CPB the flow remained constant at 2.4 L.min-1, during the 10 
      min following N or SO4Mg administration. The usual haemodynamic variables were
      monitored. RESULTS: Both N and SO4Mg decreased significantly the MAP and the SVR 
      over the 9 min following their administration. The decrease was more marked after
      SO4Mg. As the flow of the pump was unchanged after their injection the decrease
      can be attributed to the relaxing effect of these agents on the smooth vascular
      muscles. CONCLUSIONS: SO4Mg permits to treat hypertensive peaks occurring during 
      CPB as efficiently as N. Three grammes of SO4Mg have an hypotensive effect
      equivalent to that of 1 mg of nicardipine. However repetitive injections of SO4Mg
      cannot be recommended because of the risk for hypermagnesemia.

TI  - Comparison between felodipine and isosorbide mononitrate as adjunct to beta
      blockade in patients > 65 years of age with angina pectoris.
PG  - 1201-6
AB  - Coronary artery disease is an increasingly common medical problem in the elderly,
      and relatively few studies investigating drug therapy focus on this population.
      To assess the efficacy and safety of the calcium channel blocker, felodipine, and
      isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN), as adjunct to optimal beta-blocker therapy in
      elderly patients, a placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted in 46
      patients, aged between 65 and 80 years, with documented stress-induced angina
      pectoris and myocardial ischemia. With use of a latin-square design, with 3
      periods of 4 weeks each, exercise testing was performed after each period.
      Felodipine, 5 mg once daily, significantly improved both time to ischemic
      threshold and pain threshold (p = 0.02 and p = 0.003, respectively, vs placebo), 
      and tended to increase total exercise time (p = 0.06 vs placebo). In contrast,
      ISMN, 20 mg twice daily, did not significantly affect these parameters.
      Comparison of the 2 active treatment arms showed that, overall, felodipine was
      more effective than ISMN, with a statistically significant difference for time to
      ischemic threshold (p = 0.02). With regard to safety, felodipine was also better 
      tolerated than ISMN, which led to more patients discontinuing study medication
      with ISMN (p < 0.05 between ISMN and felodipine). It is concluded that in elderly
      patients who are treated with optimal beta blockade, felodipine, but not ISMN,
      leads to an additional significant reduction in ischemic parameters during
      exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Efficacy of metoprolol and diltiazem in treating silent myocardial ischemia.
PG  - 1095-8
AB  - Recent studies strongly support the prognostic importance of transient silent
      ischemia. Because patients with silent ischemia are at higher risk of a cardiac
      event, they are likely to benefit not only from control of symptoms, but also
      from treatment directed at prevention of ischemia. The efficacy of
      controlled-release metoprolol 200 mg once daily and diltiazem 60 mg 4 times daily
      was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in 32 patients with
      proven coronary artery disease, predominantly asymptomatic myocardial ischemia,
      positive bicycle exercise test results, and > or = 5 minutes of asymptomatic
      ST-segment depression on a 24-hour screening ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG). 
      At the beginning and at the end of both 3-week treatment periods, an exercise
      test was performed and a 72-hour ambulatory ECG was recorded. Both active
      treatment periods were preceded by a 2-week placebo phase. Both treatments
      effectively reduced and postponed exercise-induced ST depression and reduced the 
      total ischemic integral on the ambulatory ECG. Only metoprolol significantly
      reduced the mean number of ischemic episodes (54%, p = 0.0003, vs 31% for
      diltiazem, p = NS) and the mean duration of ischemia (51%, p = 0.012, vs 27% for 
      diltiazem, p = NS) compared with baseline values. Metoprolol strongly blunted the
      morning and afternoon peak in the circadian distribution of ischemia, whereas
      diltiazem did not change the circadian distribution of ischemia at all.

TI  - [The efficacy and safety of slow-release nicardipine vs nifedipine in angina].
PG  - 583-9
AB  - This controlled, double-blind, completely randomized study assessed the efficacy 
      and safety of nicardipine and nifedipine, both in slow-release formulations, in
      patients with unstable angina. Thirty patients (28 M, 2F) were included in the
      final analysis, mean age 56.5 +/- 9.1 years (SD), mean weight 73.5 +/- 9.2 kg,
      mean height 171.5 +/- 6.5 cm, all with unstable angina. Nicardipine was given at 
      a daily dosage of 80-120 mg, and nifedipine 40-60 mg, for up to one month. At the
      end of treatment with nicardipine supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure
      (SBP and DBP) dropped respectively 7.7% and 5.5% at 8 am and 8.6% and 7.1% at 8
      pm. Nifedipine reduced SBP and DBP by respectively 6.5% and 13.1% at 8 am and
      5.3% and 9.4% at 8 pm. There was no clinical or statistical difference between
      the treatments. Heart rate did not change appreciably during either treatment. On
      completion of nicardipine treatment, 87.5% of patients had suffered no angina
      attacks, compared with 66.7% for nifedipine. The remaining 12.5% of patients
      treated with nicardipine presented only one mild angina attack per day, while the
      other 33.3% of the nifedipine patients had one moderate angina attack per day. No
      untoward effects were reported with nicardipine; one patient receiving nifedipine
      presented cardiopalmus and another complained of headache. These results indicate
      that nicardipine is at least as safe and effective as nifedipine in the treatment
      of unstable angina.

TI  - A phase I trial of intrahepatic verapamil and doxorubicin. Regional therapy to
      overcome multidrug resistance.
PG  - 2757-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Verapamil can modulate multidrug resistance in vitro, but only at
      levels that are not tolerable when administered systemically. Regional strategies
      of drug administration may permit the delivery of high concentrations of a drug
      to specific areas with lower systemic levels. Colorectal cancers typically
      express the multidrug resistance phenotype. METHODS: A Phase I trial was
      performed to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and dose limiting
      toxicities of verapamil by hepatic artery infusion, together with doxorubicin, to
      patients with hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer. Fourteen patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer received a 14-hour intrahepatic infusion of
      verapamil. Six hours after the start of the infusion, a fixed dose of doxorubicin
      (50 mg/m2) was given, also via the hepatic artery, over a 30-minute period.
      Patients were followed by cardiac telemetry but were not in an intensive care
      setting, and no invasive monitoring was used. All patients had received prior
      intrahepatic chemotherapy. RESULTS: The MTD of intrahepatic verapamil on this
      schedule in this patient population was 1.2 mg/kg/hour. Hypotension was the dose 
      limiting toxicity. No major objective responses were noted in this heavily
      pretreated patient population. A dose of 1.0 mg/kg/hour is recommended for Phase 
      II trials. CONCLUSIONS: Based on estimations of normal hepatic artery blood flow,
      the estimated concentration of verapamil delivered to the hepatic tumors at 1.0
      mg/kg/hour is 3.6 micrograms/ml (7.3 microM), which is comparable to
      concentrations at which an in vitro reversal of MDR is seen. This study
      demonstrates that the systemic toxicities of an MDR reversal agent can be
      overcome by regional drug delivery, establishing this approach as an important
      model system for further study of MDR modulation.

TI  - [Esmolol as a bolus for prevention of sympathetic adrenergic reactions following 
      induction of anesthesia].
PG  - 723-9
AB  - In addition to laryngoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and other stressful
      intraoperative phases, hypertension occurs during recovery from anaesthesia,
      provoking post-operative complications like bleeding and increased intracranial
      or intraocular pressure. Furthermore, these hypertensive reactions result in
      life-threatening complications, especially in patients with pre-existing
      cardiovascular diseases. In this study, the effect of the new, short-acting
      beta-blocker esmolol given as a single bolus for preventing the increases in
      blood pressure and heart rate during recovery from anaesthesia and extubation in 
      patients with hypertension was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Sixty-three
      patients with a history of hypertension over a period of more than 6 months and
      blood pressure (BP) more than 150/90 mm Hg undergoing intervertebral-disc,
      otolaryngologic, or eye surgery were included in the study. The operations were
      performed during thiopentone-induced isoflurane anaesthesia with relaxation by
      atracurium. The patients were assigned to three groups after giving witnessed
      oral informed consent. During the study period they received the study drug
      twice: (A) 30-90 s before turning off the nitrous oxide; and (B) 20-90 s before
      extubation. Group I (placebo) received placebo each time, group II (100 mg
      esmolol) placebo at A and 100 mg esmolol i.v. at B, and group III (200 mg
      esmolol) 100 mg esmolol i.v. each time. After each medication the cardiovascular 
      parameters were measured noninvasively over a period of 10 min every minute and
      in the following 2 h every 15 min. RESULTS. After the first medication systolic
      and diastolic BP, heart rate (HR), and rate-pressure product (RPP) were lower in 
      patients receiving 100 mg esmolol (Group III) than in groups I and II. After the 
      second injection the blood pressure was lower in the two groups receiving 100 mg 
      esmolol, than the placebo group (I: 180.1 +/- 7.4/100.7 +/- 3.6; II: 152.8 +/-
      5.8/87.9 +/- 3.4; III: 157.9 +/- 5.3/91.5 +/- 3.6 mm Hg [mean 2 min +/- SEM]).
      The changes in HR (I: 88.2 +/- 3.8; II: 75.6 +/- 2.6; III: 72 +/- 3.1 min-1) and 
      RPP (I: 15,800 +/- 900; II: 11,700 +/- 700; III: 11,400 +/- 600) were similar. In
      8 of the 20 patients in group III the HR dropped below 60.min-1, but in none of
      these patients did the BP become instable. CONCLUSIONS. The sympathoadrenergic
      reaction during recovery from anaesthesia and extubation can be treated by
      beta-blocking agents, but such therapy is not without risk because of the long
      half-life and effects of the therapy on other factors such as postoperative loss 
      of intravascular volume. Esmolol is a new, short-acting, cardioselective
      beta-blocker with a very short plasma distribution time and a elimination
      half-life of 9.2 min. Thus, the potential risks of beta-blockers due to half-life
      are minimised. The results of this study show that a dangerous increase in BP and
      HR with increased myocardial oxygen consumption can be prevented by a single
      bolus, and better by a double bolus of 100 mg esmolol. Although bradycardia with 
      HR below 50.min-1 in 8 patients might indicate a risk of cardiac instability, the
      systolic BP did not fall below 100 mm Hg, and the episode of bradycardia was so
      short that there was no risk to the patients.

      ergometric evaluation in a crossover double-blind study].
PG  - 1395-402
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of isradipine (ISR) and diltiazem (DIL) on
      exercise tolerance and ischemic ST depression in patients with stable effort
      angina. METHODS: Fourteen out-patients, 9 males and 5 females, aged 46-65 years
      (mean +/- SD = 57 +/- 8), with ischemic heart disease and reproducible ST-segment
      depression on two consecutive exercise stress tests in baseline conditions,
      underwent a study consisting of 4 periods: 1 and 3 placebo, 2 and 4 at random ISR
      (5 mg b.i.d.) and DIL (120 mg b.i.d.). At the end of each period a multistage
      treadmill exercise stress test (Bruce protocol) was performed. RESULTS: Both
      drugs significantly (p < 0.001) increased ischemia time (IT) (0.1 mV ST
      depression) as compared to placebo, from 438 +/- 132 s. to 620 +/- 164 s. (ISR)
      and 583 +/- 147 s. (DIL) without statistical difference between two drugs (p =
      0.2), and significantly reduced (p < 0.002) the maximal ST depression, from -0.20
      +/- 0.11 mV to -0.07 +/- 0.07 mV (ISR) and -0.09 +/- 0.11 mV (DIL). At the IT,
      systolic blood pressure increased (p = 0.02), from 180 +/- 19 mm Hg to 187 +/- 15
      mm Hg (ISR) and 191 +/- 15 mm Hg (DIL); similarly, heart rate increased from 133 
      +/- 24 bpm to 144 +/- 18 bpm (ISR: p = 0.002) and 140 +/- 17 bpm (DIL: p = NS).
      CONCLUSIONS: ISR and DIL, at the above dosage have showed an important and
      significant anti-ischemic effect (IT = +41.5% during ISR and +33.1% during DIL).

TI  - At equipotent doses, isradipine is better tolerated than amlodipine in patients
      with mild-to-moderate hypertension: a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group
      study.
PG  - 335-40
AB  - 1. The objective of this double-blind parallel-group study was to compare the
      tolerability of isradipine and amlodipine, specifically, the side-effects known
      to be related to the use of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. 2. A total of
      205 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were randomized to
      receive either the sustained-release (SRO) formulation of isradipine (n = 103) or
      amlodipine (n = 102), both at dosages of 5 mg once daily. Blood pressure
      measurements were taken at the end of the dosing interval to assess the
      antihypertensive efficacy of the two drugs. 3. Adverse reactions were assessed in
      two ways: a) spontaneously reported adverse events were recorded and investigated
      in depth for severity, duration, relation to the study drug, and outcome; b) a
      questionnaire was used to elicit specific adverse reactions known to be related
      to the use of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists which were evaluated for
      severity, duration, relation to the study drug, and outcome. 4. After 6 weeks of 
      active treatment, both isradipine and amlodipine reduced mean sitting
      systolic/diastolic blood pressure: from 165.1/100.1 to 145.2/89.7 mm Hg with
      isradipine; and from 164.1/100.6 to 145.7/90.5 mm Hg with amlodipine. There was
      no difference in antihypertensive effect between isradipine and amlodipine (95%
      CI: -3.73 to 4.73 and -1.89 to 3.49 for differences in systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure, respectively). 5. The number of patients spontaneously reporting 
      adverse events was significantly higher (P = 0.02; 95% CI: 3.1 to 26.7%) with
      amlodipine (33.3%) than with isradipine (18.4%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      90, < or = 85 or < or = 80 mmHg) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in
      hypertensive patients. In addition, the study will examine the effects on
      morbidity and mortality of a low dose, 75 mg daily, of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA,
      aspirin) or placebo. In the HOT Study, basic antihypertensive treatment is
      initiated with the calcium antagonist felodipine at a dose of 5 mg daily. If
      target blood pressure is not reached, additional antihypertensive therapy with
      either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a beta-adrenoceptor
      blocking agent is given. Further dosage adjustments are made in accordance with a
      set protocol. As a fifth and final step, a diuretic may be added. Inclusion of
      patients was stopped on April 30, 1994. At that time 19,196 patients had been
      randomized. There were 9,055 (47%) women and 10,141 (53%) men with an average age
      of 61.5 +/- 7.5 (SD) years. At enrollment, 52% of patients were receiving
      antihypertensive treatment. These patients entered a wash-out period of at least 
      2 weeks before randomization. The average randomization blood pressure in
      untreated patients was 169 +/- 14/106 +/- 3 mmHg and in the treated patients 170 
      +/- 14/105 +/- 3 mmHg. On August 15, 1994, blood pressure data were available for
      14,710 and 10,275 patients, who had completed 3 and 6 months treatment,
      respectively. The average reduction in diastolic blood pressure was 22 mmHg after
      6 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET). Rationale, methodology and
      comparison with previous trials.
PG  - 171-83
AB  - The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) is a multicentre, open,
      randomised, controlled trial. The aim of this trial is to investigate the effect 
      of active treatment on stroke incidence in hypertensive patients over the age of 
      80 years. Secondary end-points include total cardiovascular mortality and
      morbidity. Entry criteria include a sustained sitting systolic blood pressure of 
      160 to 219mm Hg plus a sustained sitting diastolic pressure of 95 to 109mm Hg.
      Also required is a standing systolic blood pressure of at least 140mm Hg.
      Patients must give their informed consent, and be free of congestive heart
      failure requiring treatment, gout, renal failure or a recent cerebral
      haemorrhage. Patients are to be randomised to 3 groups-(i) no treatment; (ii)
      treatment with a diuretic [bendroflumethiazide (bendrofluazide)]; or (iii)
      treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril).
      Starting dosage for bendroflumethiazide and lisinopril is 2.5 mg/day. In order to
      achieve goal sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures (< 150/80 mm Hg), a
      doubling of the dosage is allowed. Furthermore, slow release diltiazem (120
      mg/day increasing to 240 mg/day if required) may be added to the medication of
      the actively treated groups. These drugs have been chosen as inexpensive and
      appropriate representatives of their therapeutic classes. 700 patients in each
      group (a total of 2100) will be sufficient to detect a 40% difference in
      cerebrovascular events between no treatment and active treatment (alpha = 0.01,
      1-beta = 0.90). These numbers will also detect a difference in total mortality of
      25% and in cardiovascular mortality of 35%. The pilot phase of the trial has been
      started with support from the British Heart Foundation. Centres which are
      interested in taking part should contact C.J. Bulpitt or any of the other
      authors.

      and a beta blockader on the structure and function of resistant arteries in mild 
      essential hypertension].
PG  - 979-81
AB  - Seventeen male untreated mild essential hypertensive patients with a mean age of 
      41 years agreed to participate in a double-blind randomized trial to test the
      effects of treatment with cilazapril, an inhibitor of angiotensin I converting
      enzyme, in comparison to treatment with atenolol, a beta-blocker, on the
      structure and function of subcutaneous resistance arteries. Patients were
      randomized to receive either cilazapril 2.5-5 mg or atenolol 25-100 mg per day
      per day. Blood pressure before treatment was 147/99 and 148/99 mmHg in both
      groups respectively. At 1 year of treatment blood pressure was 132/86 and 131/85 
      mmHg in both groups of patients respectively. Treatment for one year with
      cilazapril resulted in a reduction in the media/lumen ratio of resistance
      arteries (150-400 microns lumen diameter) dissected from subcutaneous gluteal
      biopsies from 7.5 +/- 0.3% before treatment to 6.3 +/- 0.2% 1 year later (p <
      0.05), still slightly but significantly larger (p < 0.05) than the media/lumen
      ratio of resistance arteries of normotensive controls (5.1 +/- 0.3%). In arteries
      from patients treated with atenolol there was no significant change with
      treatment (8.0 +/- 0.6% before and 8.1 +/- 0.5% after 1 year of treatment).
      Active wall tension responses to endothelin-1 were blunted in hypertensive
      patients and normalized in the cilazapril-treated patients, but were unchanged in
      those taking atenolol. Relaxation in response to acetylcholine of norepinephrine 
      pre-contracted arteries was still significantly reduced after one year (< 0.05)
      in comparison to those of normotensive patients in the patients treated with
      atenolol, whereas they were not in those who had received cilazapril.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Felodipine versus placebo in stable effort-induced angina pectoris in patients
      inadequately controlled with metoprolol--a dose-finding study.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - We compared the antianginal and antiischemic effect and tolerability of four
      different doses of felodipine extended-release (ER) tablets with placebo in
      patients with stable effort-induced angina pectoris treated with beta-blocker
      [metoprolol controlled release (CR) 100 mg once daily, o.d.]. Seventy-five
      patients were enrolled in the study. At the end of a 2-week single-blind period, 
      all patients performed two exercise tests. If total exercise time did not vary by
      > 15% between the two tests and both tests were limited by anginal discomfort and
      concomitant ST depression of at least 1 mm, the patients were randomized to
      double-blind treatment (66 patients). Each patient received three of the
      following treatments: felodipine 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg, or placebo. The treatments
      were given o.d. in a cross-over, balanced incomplete block design with three of
      3-week treatment periods. Exercise tests were performed 12 and 24 h after dose
      intake at the end of each treatment period. Fifty-nine patients completed the
      study. Twelve hours after dose administration, 10 and 20 mg felodipine increased 
      time to onset of anginal pain by 60 and 63 s on the average, respectively, as
      compared with placebo (p = 0.001). Time to 1-mm ST depression was prolonged by 29
      s after 10 mg (p = 0.14) and by 30 s after 20 mg (p = 0.13) felodipine. Time to
      end of exercise was increased by 28 s (p = 0.07) and 15 s (p > 0.20),
      respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Dose-response evaluation of once-daily therapy with a new formulation of
      diltiazem for stable angina pectoris. Diltiazem CD Study Group.
PG  - 9-17
AB  - Diltiazem hydrochloride in a once-daily capsule formulation (DCD) has recently
      been approved in the United States for the treatment of mild to moderate
      hypertension and chronic stable angina pectoris. This trial evaluated the dose
      response of DCD in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. In a
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-design trial, the effects and
      tolerability of once-daily therapy with placebo or DCD (60, 120, 240, 360, or 480
      mg) were evaluated 24 hours after dosing, following 3 weeks of therapy in 227
      patients with reproducible stable exertional angina pectoris. A significant
      linear dose trend (p = 0.004) was present across the 6 treatment groups for the
      primary end point--time to exercise termination at 24 hours after dosing--using a
      standard Bruce treadmill exercise test. A significant linear dose trend was also 
      seen for time to 1 mm ST-segment depression at 24 hours after dosing. Similar
      effects on exercise parameters were also seen at 4 hours after dosing. A linear
      dose trend (p = 0.04) was noted relative to the overall anginal attacks during
      daily activities and for anginal attacks during exercise (p = 0.02). Overall
      frequency of treatment-related adverse effects was dose-related and occurred in
      24.4% and 17.5% of patients treated with DCD and placebo, respectively. At a dose
      up to 240 mg/day, improvement in exercise tolerance was achieved without an
      associated increase in the rate of treatment-related adverse events compared with
      placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 965-70
AB  - Twenty-four patients with chronic stable exertional angina pectoris were
      randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to assess the
      efficacy and durability of a newly developed, sustained-release formulation of
      nifedipine (nifedipine CC) in a single 40-mg oral dose. Symptom-limited graded
      treadmill exercise tests were performed just before, and at 4, 7, and 24 h after 
      a single administration of the drug or the placebo was given. Exercise tolerance 
      at 4, 7, and 24 h after the drug were compared with the corresponding placebo
      values. Data could be analysed for 19 patients. Maximal exercise time, time to
      the onset of angina, and time to 1 mm ST segment placebo. The average maximal
      exercise time was significantly increased by 72, 76, and 37 s at 4, 7, and 24 h. 
      Rate-pressure product at rest and at peak exercise showed significant changes
      only at 24 h compared with placebo (both P < 0.05). The maximal increase in
      exercise tolerance was most marked at 7 h nifedipine CC, at which time plasma
      drug concentration was 99.4 +/- 14.0 ng.ml-1. Thus, in patients with chronic
      stable exertional angina pectoris, nifedipine CC showed a prolonged improvement
      in exercise tolerance up to 24 h after a single oral administration.

TI  - Regional oxygen consumption persists in dyskinetic canine myocardium.
PG  - 37-44
AB  - Regional myocardial O2 consumption was measured in anesthetized dogs both in
      baseline conditions and during intracoronary infusion of lidocaine, verapamil,
      sodium citrate, or 2,3-butanedione-monoxime (BDM). Despite regional hypokinesis
      and dyskinesis during drug infusion, regional O2 consumption was reduced only
      30-40% by lidocaine, verapamil, and citrate and not at all by BDM. These results 
      cast doubt on an important assumption of the "hibernation" theory: the protective
      matching of regional perfusion and contraction.

PG  - 1165-8
AB  - A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study tested peak and
      trough efficacy of immediate-release nisoldipine (20 mg twice daily) added to
      existent beta-adrenergic blocking therapy. Patients were randomized with a
      history of chronic stable angina, while receiving a stable regimen of a
      beta-blocking agent, with exercise test-induced angina in association with 1 mm
      horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression and exercise test reproducibility
      of +/- 15%. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (48-hour) was performed at
      3 of 5 centers (44 patients). Efficacy was achieved in 53 patients (26 taking
      immediate-release nisoldipine/placebo in sequence and 27 taking
      placebo/immediate-release nisoldipine in sequence). Total exercise time increased
      compared with placebo at peak, but only a trend was seen at trough. Time to 1 mm 
      ST-segment depression at peak and trough and ambulatory electrocardiographic
      parameters were also improved. Adverse effects were mild. This trial confirms
      that immediate-release nisoldipine when added to existent beta-blocker therapy is
      an active antianginal and anti-ischemic agent, but that the immediate-release
      formulation loses its antianginal effect at the end of its dosing interval (9 to 
      14 hours). This drug is therefore being examined in a new extended-release
      formulation (Coat-Core).

TI  - Effects of bepridil on silent myocardial ischemia and eicosanoid metabolism in
      chronic stable angina pectoris after healing of myocardial infarction.
PG  - 1063-8
AB  - To investigate the effects of bepridil on silent myocardial ischemia and on
      eicosanoid metabolism, 10 patients with chronic stable angina underwent exercise 
      treadmill testing and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring both
      before and after 4 weeks of bepridil administration (150 mg/day). Fasting venous 
      levels of thromboxane B2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and leukotriene C4 were 
      measured by radioimmunoassay. Bepridil decreased heart rate responses to daily
      activities during ambulatory monitoring, and significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the
      median frequency and duration of silent myocardial ischemic episodes (from 5.5 to
      0 events/48 hours and from 86 to 0 minutes/48 hours respectively). Bepridil
      significantly decreased the blood pressure heart rate product at peak exercise
      and significantly prolonged the mean exercise tolerance time (from 456.6 to 527.0
      second). Bepridil also significantly decreased the plasma levels of thromboxane
      B2 and leukotriene C4 at rest. These results suggest that bepridil may reduce
      silent myocardial ischemic episodes either by the reduction of cardiac oxygen
      demand during daily activities and exercise stress, or by controlling coronary
      and systemic vasomotor tone. The drug also has a salutary effect on eicosanoid
      metabolism, to which its efficacy on silent myocardial ischemic episodes may be
      related.

PG  - 565-7
AB  - Cyclosporine and nifedipine therapy produces gingival overgrowth in many
      patients. Neither the mechanism underlying this undesirable side effect nor the
      possibility of synergism between these drugs is known, although many renal
      transplant patients receive both drugs. This study compared the rates of
      3H-glucosamine utilization by three groups of fibroblasts: untreated gingival
      fibroblasts, fibroblasts from gingival overgrowth tissue of a patient receiving
      both cyclosporine and nifedipine, and normal gingival fibroblasts exposed to
      cyclosporine-A in vitro. Significant differences in the rates of deposition of
      3H-glucosamine into the extracellular matrix by each group of gingival
      fibroblasts were demonstrated, suggesting that increased rates of deposition of
      proteoglycans into the gingival extracellular matrix by fibroblasts should be
      further investigated as a biologic mechanism for gingival overgrowth.

PG  - 952-8
AB  - To elucidate the effect of isradipine and nifedipine on left ventricular (LV)
      systolic and diastolic function, each drug was given intravenously (i.v.) in
      equihypotensive doses to 10 patients accepted for coronary arteriography for
      stable angina pectoris. All 20 patients had LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of < 40% 
      owing to previous myocardial infarction (MI). Systolic and diastolic function was
      assessed by standard hemodynamic parameters and pressure-volume relations
      measured by nuclear stethoscope. All measurements were taken at rest and during
      ischemia caused by right atrial pacing. Both systolic and diastolic parameters
      improved equally with isradipine and nifedipine. LVEF and cardiac output (CO)
      increased owing to peripheral vasodilatation. A decrease in P/Vmax, indicating a 
      negative inotropic effect, was noted in patients at rest with both medications,
      but not during pacing-induced ischemia. With either medication, the time constant
      of relaxation and the end-diastolic elasticity constant decreased during pacing, 
      indicating improvement in diastolic function, probably owing to relief of
      myocardial ischemia.

TI  - Effects of tissue plasminogen activator and a comparison of early invasive and
      conservative strategies in unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. 
      Results of the TIMI IIIB Trial. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia.
PG  - 1545-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although coronary thrombosis plays a critical role in the
      pathogenesis of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (NQMI), the 
      effects of thrombolytic therapy in these disorders is not clear. Also, the role
      of routine early coronary arteriography followed by revascularization has not
      been established. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (n = 1473) seen within 24 hours
      of ischemic chest discomfort at rest, considered to represent unstable angina or 
      NQMI, were randomized using a 2 x 2 factorial design to compare (1) TPA versus
      placebo as initial therapy and (2) an early invasive strategy (early coronary
      arteriography followed by revascularization when the anatomy was suitable) versus
      an early conservative strategy (coronary arteriography followed by
      revascularization if initial medical therapy failed). All patients were treated
      with bed rest, anti-ischemic medications, aspirin, and heparin. The primary end
      point for the TPA-placebo comparison (death, myocardial infarction, or failure of
      initial therapy at 6 weeks) occurred in 54.2% of the TPA-treated patients and
      55.5% of the placebo-treated patients (P = NS). Fatal and nonfatal myocardial
      infarction after randomization (reinfarction in NQMI patients) occurred more
      frequently in TPA-treated patients (7.4%) than in placebo-treated patients (4.9%,
      P = .04, Kaplan-Meier estimate). Four intracranial hemorrhages occurred in the
      TPA-treated group versus none in the placebo-treated group (P = .06). The end
      point for the comparison of the two strategies (death, myocardial infarction, or 
      an unsatisfactory symptom-limited exercise stress test at 6 weeks) occurred in
      18.1% of patients assigned to the early conservative strategy and 16.2% of
      patients assigned to the early invasive strategy (P = NS). In the latter, the
      average length of initial hospitalization, incidence of rehospitalization within 
      6 weeks, and days of rehospitalization all were significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS:
      In the overall trial, patients with unstable angina and NQMI were managed with
      low rates of mortality (2.4%) and myocardial infarction or reinfarction (6.3%) at
      the time of the 6-week visit. These results can be achieved using either an early
      conservative or early invasive strategy, the latter resulting in a reduced
      incidence of days of hospitalization and of rehospitalization and in the use of
      antianginal drugs. The addition of a thrombolytic agent is not beneficial and may
      be harmful.

TI  - Clinical and pharmacologic study of multidrug resistance reversal with
      vinblastine and bepridil.
PG  - 812-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To achieve an adequate plasma concentration of bepridil, a calcium
      channel blocker, which reverts multidrug resistance (MDR) in vitro, when
      administered in combination with vinblastine in patients with advanced colorectal
      cancer, a tumor characterized by high MDR1 gene expression. To study the
      pharmacokinetics of both drugs, tolerability and antitumor activity in relation
      to the MDR1 expression in tumor tissue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen colorectal 
      cancer patients entered the study. Bepridil was administered by central venous
      catheter as 5-mg/kg bolus over 30 minutes, followed by 12 mg/kg for 12 hours and 
      5 mg/kg for 24 hours. Vinblastine 5 mg/m2 was administered as an intravenous
      (i.v.) bolus 24.5 hours after the start of bepridil. MDR1/P-glycoprotein (Pgp)
      expression was assessed in 14 tumor samples by immunohistochemistry and RNase
      protection assay. RESULTS: The bepridil plasma level was greater than 2 mumol/L
      at the time of vinblastine administration in all patients investigated. At the
      dose used in the study, bepridil produced a QTc-prolongation more than 50 ms,
      which prevented further dose escalation. However, cardiac toxicity was
      asymptomatic in all treated patients, and other side effects were mild. MDR1/Pgp 
      expression was positive in nine of 14 cases. Of fifteen patients assessable for
      response, one complete remission of 8 months' duration and 14 progressions were
      observed. The responding patient attained complete remission again when
      re-treated on progression with vinblastine alone. CONCLUSION: Bepridil plasma
      concentrations needed in vitro to modulate MDR could be achieved in this study
      with tolerable toxicity; however, despite most tumors being MDR1/Pgp-positive, no
      response was obtained that could be attributed to the drug combination.
      Mechanisms of drug resistance other than MDR are probably implicated in drug
      resistance of colorectal cancer.

TI  - Verapamil treatment after coronary angioplasty in patients at high risk of
      recurrent stenosis.
PG  - 254-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose verapamil treatment (240 mg
      twice daily) in the prevention of angiographic restenosis after primary
      successful coronary angioplasty in patients at high risk of recurrent
      obstruction. DESIGN: A placebo controlled, double blind trial in which patients
      with stable angina pectoris and patients with unstable angina or non-Q wave
      infarction treated with 330 mg aspirin and 75 mg dipyridamole twice daily were
      randomised to a verapamil group or a control group. Follow up angiography was
      performed 6 months after angioplasty or sooner if signs of recurrent ischaemia
      developed. SETTING: University department of cardiology. PATIENTS: 196
      consecutive patients undergoing coronary angioplasty from the beginning of April 
      1987 to the end of March 1989 and meeting the selection criteria that included
      the presence of at least one of six predefined risk factors for restenosis. At
      the time of coronary angioplasty 113 patients had unstable angina or non-Q wave
      infarction and 83 had stable angina pectoris. RESULTS: In 89 (91%) patients in
      the verapamil group and in 83 (85%) control patients follow up angiograms were
      available. The restenosis rate was lower in the verapamil group (48.3%) than in
      the placebo group (62.7%) (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.303 to
      1.025 p = 0.059). Of the 172 patients in whom follow up angiograms were
      available, 24 (13 taking verapamil and 11 taking placebo) did not comply with the
      trial for more than 40 (34) days (mean (1 SD)). For the remaining 148 patients
      the restenosis rate was 47.4% in the verapamil group and 63.9% in the placebo
      group (odds ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.271 to 0.993, p = 0.046). In the 97 patients
      with unstable angina or non-Q wave infarction the restenosis rate was not
      significantly influenced by verapamil (55.8% with verapamil v 62.2% with placebo,
      odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.339 to 1.728, p = 0.520). In the 75 patients with
      stable angina pectoris the restenosis rate dropped from 63.2% with placebo to
      37.8% with verapamil (odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.137 to 0.917, p = 0.038).
      CONCLUSION: The observed beneficial effect of high-dose verapamil treatment on
      the angiographic restenosis rate in patients with stable angina pectoris and at
      increased risk of recurrent obstruction requires confirmation in further
      prospective studies.

TI  - Calcium channel blocking drug overdose: an Australian series.
PG  - 161-6
AB  - 1. A descriptive case study of calcium channel-blocking drug (CCB) overdoses in
      the Hunter Region of NSW was performed to analyse the in-hospital morbidity and
      mortality of CCB drug overdoses in an Australian population. 2. The patients were
      admitted to major hospitals within the Hunter Region and treated initially with
      gastrointestinal decontamination, including the use of oral activated charcoal.
      Further management was required in most cases and included intravenous calcium,
      atropine and inotropic support. 3. Of the 15 CCB overdoses, four patients died.
      Noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema occurred in two other cases. Cardiac conduction
      defects occurred in 11 cases. 4. Atropine was found to be effective only after
      intravenous calcium had been administered. 5. Overdose with slow-release
      verapamil required prolonged treatment with intravenous calcium salts. 6.
      Overdose with verapamil or diltiazem in doses greater than 300 mg carries a
      significant risk of death and potentially life threatening arrhythmias occur with
      lower doses. 7. Recommended initial management includes early, effective
      gastrointestinal decontamination. High dose intravenous calcium salts should be
      given to reverse hypotension and bradycardia. Atropine and inotropic support are 
      frequently required.

TI  - Investigation of therapeutic mechanisms of atenolol and diltiazem in patients
      with variable-threshold angina.
PG  - 312-7
AB  - The effects of beta-adrenoreceptor and calcium channel-blocking agents on the
      balance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand were studied in 15 patients (2
      women and 13 men), aged 46 to 69 (mean 62) years, with variable-threshold angina.
      An exercise test was performed before therapy was begun, and 24-hour ambulatory
      ECG monitoring was performed after 1 week of long-acting nitrate therapy, in the 
      third week after random assignment to either atenolol or diltiazem, and in the
      third week after crossover. All exercise tests were positive except in one
      patient taking diltiazem. The exercise time to 0.1 mV ST change was 4.2 +/- 1.7
      minutes with no therapy, 5.1 +/- 1.6 minutes with nitrates, 6.6 +/- 0.8 minutes
      with diltiazem, and 6.5 +/- 2.1 minutes with atenolol. The rate-pressure product 
      at 0.1 mV ST change was 20.9 +/- 4.6 with no therapy and 21.2 +/- 5.7 and 22 +/- 
      4.6 with nitrates and diltiazem, respectively, but fell to 15 +/- 3.9
      beats.min.-1 mm Hg 10(-3) after atenolol (p < 0.01). There was no significant
      difference in the number of anginal attacks or in nitroglycerin consumption per
      week. The heart rate at the onset of ST-segment change during the exercise test
      and during ambulatory ECG monitoring was significantly lower during atenolol than
      during diltiazem treatment. Both atenolol and diltiazem were of similar efficacy 
      in increasing nonischemic exercise duration in patients with variable-threshold
      angina and acted primarily by slowing the resting heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

      arterial hypertension included in the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trial II. The
      Danish Study Group on Verapamil in Myocardial Infarction.
PG  - 85-8
AB  - An increased incidence of reinfarction and cardiovascular events has been
      reported in patients with hypertension recovering from acute myocardial
      infarction. We studied the effect of intervention with verapamil on the
      development of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events in 301 patients
      with hypertension enrolled in the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trial II. During
      the second week after the index infarct, patients were randomly assigned to
      treatment with verapamil 360 mg per day (n = 149) or placebo (n = 152) and
      followed-up to 18 months (mean 16 months). The 18 months first reinfarction rates
      were 12.5% in verapamil and 19.8% in placebo treated patients (hazard ratio 0.53,
      95% confidence limits 0.28-1.00, P = 0.04). The first cardiovascular event rates 
      were 21.8% in the verapamil and 29.3% in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.66,
      95% confidence limits 0.41-1.06, P = 0.07). In this retrospective analysis of
      patients with hypertension included in the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trial II, 
      intervention with verapamil reduced cardiovascular events primarily due to a
      substantial reduction in reinfarctions.

TI  - [Comparative study of the efficacy and tolerability of bepridil and diltiazem in 
      unstable angina. 277 patients].
PG  - 77-83
AB  - Bepridil has been used only rarely in unstable angina since its long half-life
      could imply a delayed action. A loading dose could deal with this disadvantage.
      In order to confirm this hypothesis, a randomised trial was undertaken involving 
      a 5 day comparison of bepridil at the dose of 300 mg/day after a loading dose
      (900 mg on D1, 500 mg on D2 and D3) with diltiazem 360 mg/day in 277 patients:
      210 men and 67 women, with a mean age of 62.1 +/- 9.5, suffering from unstable
      angina confirmed by an ECG during symptomatic events showing reversible ST
      depression. A continuous 72 hour ECG record was obtained in 82 patients. Because 
      of 69 inclusion errors, only 208 patients provided evaluable data (110 with
      bepridil and 98 with diltiazem), including 55 with continuous ECGs. Mortality
      (4.5% bepridil v. 3.1% diltiazem) and premature treatment terminations for
      therapeutic inefficacy (4.5% bepridil v. 7.1% diltiazem), myocardial infarction
      (3.6% bepridil v. 3% diltiazem), adverse events (3.6% bepridil v. 3% diltiazem)
      or at the patient's request (0.9% bepridil) were similar between the 2 groups.
      Efficacy regarding angina was similar, with 18.2% recurrences with bepridil and
      21.4% with diltiazem during the first 72 hours, persisting without any difference
      beyond 72 hours. Resulting treatment adjustments concerning nitrates were
      identical in the 2 groups. Among the 55 patients with an evaluable continuous ECG
      (27 bepridil and 28 diltiazem, NS), 18 had recurrent ischemic episodes (9
      bepridil and 9 diltiazem), 72.2% of which were clinically silent. Their total
      number, total duration and maximum amplitude of ST depression were similar in the
      2 groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Inefficacy of diltiazem in restenosis prevention after coronary angioplasty].
PG  - 99-102
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of diltiazem in preventing restenosis after
      balloon angioplasty (PTCA). METHODS: Eighty-nine patients who were undergone to
      successful PTCA, were divided them in 2 groups (G): A) 44 patients (50%) who
      received diltiazem (180 mg tid) immediately after PTCA and were kept on it for 6 
      months); B) 45 patients (50%) who received placebo. Fifty two lesions were
      dilated in GA and 54 in GB. Patients were excluded from analysis for several
      reasons, including: necessity of diltiazem or others calcium channel blockers
      use; heart failure, bradicardia, AV block of any degree, PTCA to chronic total
      occlusion, ostial lesions and AMI less than 30 days prior to PTCA. Patients were 
      randomized to either the active drug or placebo in a double blind fashion.
      Restenosis was defined as a 50% lesion. Patients underwent late angiography
      either at 6 months or sooner if clinically indicated. RESULTS: Both G were
      similar to age > 70 years (A = 7% vs B = 4%-p = NS), sex (A = 13% vs B = 11%-p = 
      NS), stable angina (A = 43% vs B = 51%), unstable angina (A = 57% vs B = 49%-p = 
      NS) and single vessel (A = 91% vs B = 87%-p = NS) or multivessel (A = 9% vs B =
      13%-p = NS) PTCA. We studied 39/44 (89%) patients in GA and 43/45 (96%) in GB (p 
      = NS). We observed restenosis in 17/39 (43%) in GA and 16/43 (37%) in GB (p =
      NS). The restenosis rate per lesion was 39% in GA and 31% in GB (p = NS).
      CONCLUSION: Diltiazem was ineffective in the prevention of restenosis following
      PTCA.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine in elderly
      hypertensive women.
PG  - 77-86
AB  - PURPOSE: This trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three
      different classes of antihypertensive agents in elderly women. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: The trial had three phases: 4 to 8 weeks of placebo, 6 weeks of
      titration, and 16 weeks of maintenance. White women between 60 and 80 years old
      with sitting diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) from 95 through 114 mm Hg treated
      with placebo were evaluated by history, physical examination, laboratory studies,
      and quality-of-life interview. After double-blind randomization with low-dose
      atenolol, enalapril, or isradipine, the dose was increased stepwise and
      hydrochlorothiazide added as needed to achieve goal DBP (less than 90 mm Hg and
      greater than 10 mm Hg below baseline). During maintenance, patients not at goal
      were "stepped up," and patients with uncontrolled DBP at maximum dosage were
      removed from the study. The pretreatment (baseline) blood pressure of the 315
      randomized participants averaged 161/100 mm Hg; 92% had been treated previously
      for hypertension, 15% had diabetes mellitus, 11% smoked, and 38% consumed
      alcohol. RESULTS: For 245 patients completing the trial, the average decrease in 
      blood pressure during treatment was 18.2/15.6 mm Hg. Antihypertensive efficacy
      was similar for the monotherapy drug regimens, with 84%, 71%, and 80% of patients
      receiving atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine, respectively, achieving DBP goal. 
      Of the 70 patients who did not complete the trial, 42 left because of symptoms
      and 19 because of uncontrolled DBP. No important, unexpected drug-induced changes
      in symptoms or blood chemistries were noted. Symptom frequency differed little
      among the three dosage levels, becoming maximal by the second visit at the same
      dosage level. CONCLUSION: All three drugs lowered DBP comparably, and none

TI  - Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in chronic stable angina: effects on
      myocardial ischaemia and comparison with nifedipine.
PG  - 30-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the anti-ischaemic effects of a new angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor, benazepril, compared with nifedipine, alone and in
      combination, in chronic stable angina caused by coronary artery disease. DESIGN: 
      Placebo controlled, double blind, latin square design. SETTING: Regional
      cardiology service for a mixed urban and rural population. SUBJECTS: 40 patients 
      with stable exertional angina producing at least 1 mm ST segment depression on
      exercise test with the Bruce protocol. 34 patients completed all four phases of
      the trial. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient was treated with placebo, benazepril (10
      mg twice daily), nifedipine retard (20 mg twice daily), and a combination of
      benazepril and nifedipine in the same doses, in random order for periods of two
      weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: Total duration of exercise was not
      increased by any treatment. Exercise time to the development of 1 mm ST segment
      depression was not significantly changed with benazepril alone or in combination 
      with nifedipine but was increased with nifedipine from 4.18 (1.8) min to 4.99
      (1.6) min (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.28 to 1.34; p < 0.05). There was a 
      significant relation between increase in duration of exercise and resting renin
      concentration (r = 0.498; p < 0.01). Myocardial ischaemia during daily activity, 
      as assessed by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, was reduced by
      benazepril and by the benazepril and nifedipine combination. This was significant
      for total ischaemic burden (451(628) min v 231(408) min; 95% CI -398 to -41 min; 
      p < 0.05) and maximal depth of ST segment depression (-2.47(1.2) mm v -2.16 mm;
      95% CI 0.04 to 0.57; p < 0.05) for the combination and for maximal ST segment
      depth for benazepril monotherapy (-2.47 (1.2) mm v -1.96(1.2) mm; 95% CI 0.18 to 
      0.91; p < 0.05). Benazepril significantly altered the circadian rhythm of cardiac
      ischaemia, abolishing the peak ischaemic periods at 0700 to 1200 and 1700 to 2300
      (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Benazepril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, 
      had a modest anti-ischaemic effect in effort angina, but this effect was not as
      pronounced as with nifedipine. The anti-ischaemic action was more noticeable in
      asymptomatic ischaemia during daily activity, whereas nifedipine had little
      effect on this aspect of myocardial ischaemia. The combination of benazepril and 
      nifedipine reduced ischaemia of daily activity.

TI  - Comparison of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system and atenolol on
      antianginal efficacies and exercise hemodynamic responses in stable angina
      pectoris.
PG  - 23-8
AB  - A gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) of nifedipine has been developed to 
      provide a once-daily dosing, and predictable, relatively constant plasma
      concentrations. This study compared the antianginal efficacy of nifedipine GITS
      with a once-a-day beta-receptor blocker, atenolol. Seventeen patients with
      documented coronary artery disease and stable stress-induced angina pectoris were
      studied during a 2-week, single-blind, placebo baseline phase and a 12-week
      randomized, double-blind, active drug crossover efficacy phase, using the bicycle
      exercise test and ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings. Patients exercised 
      significantly longer with nifedipine GITS (883 +/- 47 seconds) and atenolol (908 
      +/- 44 seconds) than with placebo (794 +/- 41 seconds). Nifedipine GITS reduced
      systolic blood pressure at all stages of exercise compared with placebo but,
      because heart rate tended to increase more during nifedipine therapy, there was
      no difference in rate-pressure products between the placebo and nifedipine GITS
      periods. In contrast, atenolol reduced heart rate, systolic blood pressure and
      rate-pressure product during exercise compared with placebo. Whereas left
      ventricular ejection fractions (by radionuclide angiocardiography) increased with
      exercise, the maximal increase was smaller with atenolol than with placebo and
      nifedipine. The net increase in left ventricular ejection fraction at the end of 
      exercise was greater with nifedipine than with placebo or atenolol. Ambulatory
      electrocardiograms showed only a small number of ischemic events. Neither
      nifedipine GITS nor atenolol reduced the number of ischemic events or total
      duration of ST-segment deviations significantly. It is concluded that nifedipine 
      GITS is as effective an antianginal agent as atenolol, but the hemodynamic
      effects of the 2 agents differ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 42-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of efficacy of intravenous flecainide to revert
      supraventricular arrhythmias to sinus rhythm in patients with respiratory
      insufficiency. DESIGN: Comparative randomized prospective trial. SETTING: ICU in 
      a University Hospital. PATIENTS: 30 patients with acute respiratory insufficiency
      or acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory insufficiency and supraventricular
      arrhythmias. Intravenous flecainide was administered to 15 patients (Group A) (2 
      mg/kg for 10 min and continuous perfusion of 1.5 mg/kg for 1 h). Intravenous
      verapamil was administered to 15 patients (Group B) (0.15 mg/kg for 5 min and
      continuous perfusion of 0.005 mg/kg/min for 1 h). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The
      categories of patients' arrhythmias were: Group A-atrial fibrillation (AF) in 5
      cases, atrial flutter (AFl) in 2, multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) in 4 and
      other supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in 4. Group B-AF in 6 cases, AFL in 2,
      MAT in 2 and SVT in 5 cases. Flecainide reverted arrhythmias to sinus rhythm in
      12 out of 15 cases (80%); of these 12, 11 reverted with the initial bolus.
      Verapamil reverted 5 out of 12 cases (33.3%, p < 0.01). No significant secondary 
      adverse effects were detected. CONCLUSION: Intravenous flecainide is an effective
      antiarrhythmic drug to treat acute supraventricular arrhythmias in patients with 
      respiratory insufficiency.

PG  - 285-9
AB  - Pharmacokinetic interaction between benazepril (ACE inhibitor) and amlodipine
      (calcium channel blocker) was studied in 12 healthy subjects. Single doses of
      benazepril hydrochloride (10-mg tablet) and amlodipine besylate (tablet
      equivalent to 5 mg amlodipine) were administered alone or in combination
      according to a three-way, Latin-Square, randomized cross-over design. Serial
      blood samples were collected following each administration for the determination 
      of benazepril and its active metabolite benazeprilat and amlodipine. The mean
      values of AUC (0-4 h), Cmax and Tmax for benazepril given as combination versus
      given alone were 161 vs 140 ng.h.ml-1, 168 vs 149 ng.ml-1, and 0.5 vs 0.6 h. The 
      mean values of AUC (0-24 h), Cmax and Tmax for benazeprilat after benazepril
      given as combination versus given alone were 1470 vs 1410 ng.h.ml-1, 292 vs 257
      ng.ml-1, and 1.7 vs 1.5 h. The mean values of AUC (0-144 h), Cmax and Tmax for
      amlodipine given as combination versus given alone were 118 vs 114 ng.h.ml-1, 2.5
      vs 2.3 ng.ml-1, and 8.3 vs 9.0 h. The differences in these pharmacokinetic
      parameters between the combination and monotherapy treatments were not
      statistically significant based on ANOVA. The results of this study indicate that
      no pharmacokinetic interaction existed between the two drugs.

PG  - 290-7
AB  - Hemodynamic problems resulting from cardiac arrhythmias often occur in patients
      undergoing coronary bypass grafting in the early postoperative period. Therefore,
      in this study the antiarrhythmic effects of the calcium channel antagonist
      diltiazem were evaluated in coronary bypass grafting. Forty patients were
      randomly assigned either to a therapy with diltiazem or nitroglycerin.
      Hemodynamic measurements were established by Swan-Ganz catheter, and long-term
      ECG analyses were performed preoperatively and 1, 3 and 5 days after operation.
      There were significantly fewer ventricular arrhythmias (Lown class IV) in the
      diltiazem groups than in the nitroglycerin groups (p < 0.05). Supraventricular
      tachycardias were significantly more often observed in the nitroglycerin groups
      on all 3 days (p < 0.05). As a result, the calcium channel antagonist diltiazem
      is recommended as a standard adjunct to perioperative medication in cardiac
      surgery.

      fibrillation].
PG  - 101-8
AB  - Rapid, reliable and safe reestablishment of sinus rhythm is the major aim of
      pharmacologic treatment in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. The
      mainstay of therapy in this arrhythmia has been quinidine. More recently,
      amiodarone was shown in noncomparitive studies to be superior to class IA agents 
      under certain conditions. In 40 patients with atrial fibrillation persisting for 
      4 weeks up to 2 years, the efficacy and safety of either quinidine and verapamil 
      (days 1 to 3, quinidine 1,500 mg/day; days 4 to 6, quinidine 1,500 mg+verapamil
      240 mg/day) or amiodarone therapy (days 1 to 3, amiodarone 1,200 mg/day
      intravenously; days 4 to 14, amiodarone 800 mg/day orally) were randomly
      examined. Responders continued on their effective medication for 3 months.
      Thereafter, all patients were treated with a fixed regimen of quinidine (480
      mg/day) plus verapamil (240 mg/day) for up to 2 years. During atrial
      fibrillation, quinidine reduced mean ventricular cycle length by 40 ms (-5%),
      quinidine and verapamil increased mean cycle length by 57 ms (8%) and amiodarone 
      by 192 ms (28%, p < 0.01). In addition, quinidine and verapamil had a
      characteristic "rate-smoothing" effect on atrioventricular conduction during
      atrial fibrillation. The rhythm was converted to sinus rhythm after quinidine in 
      5 (25%) of 20 patients and after the combination of quinidine and verapamil in 11
      (55%) of 20 patients. Amiodarone restored sinus rhythm in 12 (60%) of 20
      patients. Overall, a shorter duration of atrial fibrillation (p < 0.05) and a
      smaller left atrial size (p < 0.01) were predictive of successful conversion of
      the arrhythmia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      disappointing, probably because of reflex sympathetic activation through arterial
      vasodilation. However, nilvadipine may be beneficial for treatment of chronic
      heart failure since this drug has minimal effects on sympathetic activation. In
      this study, the effects of 12-week administration of nilvadipine or placebo on
      symptoms of heart failure and cardiac function were investigated in 23 patients
      with mild-to-moderate chronic heart failure in a double-blind trial. The patients
      were randomly assigned to either a nilvadipine group (16 mg daily) or a placebo
      group. Intergroup comparisons did not show significant differences in any
      parameters. Serious adverse effects were not observed during the study. Thus,
      this study failed to show any beneficial effect of nilvadipine in the long-term
      treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. We conclude that the long-term 
      administration of nilvadipine (16 mg daily) is neither effective nor harmful in
      the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure.

PG  - 23-30; discussion 30-1
AB  - Nifedipine GITS (Gastro-Intestinal Therapeutic System) is a recently launched
      long-acting formulation of nifedipine. The aim of the Italian Nifedipine GITS
      Study was to determine the duration of the antihypertensive effect of once-daily 
      nifedipine GITS in outpatients with essential hypertension. After a 2-week
      placebo run-in period, 126 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension 
      (diastolic BP95 to 114mm Hg) were randomised to receive nifedipine GITS 30mg (n =
      42), nifedipine GITS 60mg (n = 42) or placebo (n = 42), once daily in a
      double-blind fashion for 4 weeks. At the end of the run-in and treatment periods,
      ambulatory BP monitoring was performed (Spacelabs 90202 or 90207 device) to
      provide regular 15-minute BP readings for 24 to 36 hours. In the 81 patients with
      at least 24 hours of valid ambulatory BP data, the average systolic and diastolic
      BP changes after treatment with nifedipine GITS 30mg (n = 25), nifedipine GITS
      60mg (n = 28) and placebo (n = 28) were -16.5/-10.8, -16.3/-10.0 and +0.4/+0.9mm 
      Hg, respectively. BP changes with nifedipine GITS differed significantly (p <
      0.01) from those with placebo. Heart rate was not significantly altered by
      nifedipine GITS. The effects of nifedipine GITS and placebo on ambulatory BP 24
      hours and 36 hours after the last dose were evaluated in 56 patients with
      complete 36-hour ambulatory BP profiles. After 24 hours, both doses of nifedipine
      GITS caused significant (p < 0.01) reductions in systolic and diastolic
      BP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 1069-75
AB  - The efficacy of a new sustained-release formulation of diltiazem was examined in 
      a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in patients with stable angina. Doses of
      60 mg BID, 90 mg BID, 180 mg BID and 240 mg BID were compared with placebo in 208
      patients at 3 hours and 12 hours after dosing. Diltiazem, in doses of 90 mg BID
      and 180 mg BID, was statistically superior to placebo with respect to increasing 
      total exercise time. Treadmill exercise time at 3 hours postdose increased with
      placebo from 356.1 +/- 118.7 sec to 375.7 +/- 119.8 sec (NS); with 90 mg BID,
      382.7 +/- 111.8 sec to 445.4 +/- 117.5 sec (P < 0.005); and with 180 mg BID,
      386.8 +/- 145.9 sec to 467.2 +/- 166.2 sec (P < 0.0001). At 12 hours postdose,
      treadmill exercise time with placebo increased from 357.6 +/- 128.3 sec to 383.8 
      +/- 128.7 sec (NS); with 90 mg BID, 395.2 +/- 119.4 sec to 449.7 +/- 123.1 sec (P
      = 0.053); with 180 mg BID, 395.3 +/- 141.4 sec to 476.6 +/- 165.6 sec (P <
      0.0001). Time to onset of angina was also increased by the 180-mg-BID dose both
      at 3 hours postdose (257.3 +/- 126.8 sec to 354.3 +/- 158.7 sec; P < 0.0001) and 
      at 12 hours postdose (274.7 +/- 131.2 sec to 377.4 +/- 186.2 sec; P < 0.0001).
      Sustained-release diltiazem is effective and safe in treating patients with
      chronic stable angina.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and additional anti-ischaemic effectiveness of amlodipine, a
      once-daily calcium antagonist, during acute and long-term therapy of stable
      angina pectoris in patients pre-treated with a beta-blocker.
PG  - 1531-5
AB  - Amlodipine 10 mg was evaluated for additional anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal
      efficacy in 14 patients pre-treated with a beta-blocker who had documented
      coronary artery disease, stable angina pectoris, and > or = 2 mm of
      exercise-induced ST segment depression. For 2 days the patients received
      open-label amlodipine and then, according to a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      cross-over and double-blind protocol, they were treated with amlodipine or
      placebo, respectively, once a day for 3 weeks each. Exercise tests and blood
      sampling for plasma concentrations of amlodipine were performed at 8 and at 24 h 
      after dosing on both days of acute testing as well as on day 18 of chronic
      treatment. During chronic treatment, when plasma concentrations fluctuated
      between 23.5 ng.ml-1 at 8 h and 14 ng.ml-1 at 24 h post-dosing, ST segment
      depression at an individually comparable workload was significantly decreased by 
      28% compared with placebo (P < 0.005) at both points in time. Increases in
      ischaemia-free workload capacity amounted to 76% (P < 0.005) and to 81% (P <
      0.01) at 8 and at 24 h, respectively. The number of anginal attacks was reduced
      by 39% (P < 0.05). Conversely, after initial dosing, i.e. when plasma
      concentrations declined from 4.7 ng.ml-1 to 3.9 ng.ml-1, influences upon
      ischaemic parameters compared to control values were markedly less at 24 h as
      opposed to 8 h. There were no untoward side effects observed at any point in
      time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 323-30
AB  - 1. The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a low dose combination of
      the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (2.5 mg) and the extended
      release formulation of the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist felodipine 
      (5 mg) were assessed in a double-blind, double dummy placebo controlled,
      randomised, crossover study in 20 patients (mean age 55.4 years; range 46-69)
      with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension (supine diastolic > 90 mmHg <
      115 mmHg after 4 weeks of single-blind wash-out on placebo). The four randomised,
      double-blind, crossover study phases evaluated the response to 4 weeks of once
      daily treatment with placebo, monotherapy with each drug and the combination.
      Noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Spacelabs 90207) was performed 
      for 24 h at the end of each phase. 2. The mean 24 h ambulatory blood pressure
      (mmHg) was 147.9/92.0 following placebo, 141.3/87.8 following monotherapy with
      ramipril 2.5 mg, 136.8/85.8 following monotherapy with felodipine ER 5 mg and
      131.1/82.6 following the combination of ramipril 2.5 mg and felodipine ER 5 mg.
      All active treatment phases significantly reduced mean 24 h ambulatory diastolic 
      pressure by comparison with placebo. The antihypertensive efficacy of the
      combination was additive. 3. The coadministration of ramipril did not attenuate
      the incidence of headache attributable to felodipine ER.

TI  - A comparison of the acute haemodynamic effects of nisoldipine and nifedipine
      during treatment with atenolol in patients with coronary artery disease.
PG  - 315-21
AB  - 1. The acute haemodynamic effects of intravenous nisoldipine (1, 2, 4 microg
      kg(-1)) and nifedipine (2.5, 5, 10 microg kg(-1)) were compared in a randomised, 
      within-patient crossover study. Fifteen male patients with stable angina pectoris
      treated with atenolol were studied after undergoing routine cardiac
      catheterisation. 2. Nisoldipine caused a dose-related fall in systemic vascular
      resistance (maximum 22%) associated with an increase in heart rate and cardiac
      index (18%) and a fall in mean arterial pressure (7%). 3. By contrast, nifedipine
      was associated with a significant increase in heart rate but systemic vascular
      resistance, cardiac index and mean arterial pressure remained unaltered. 4. At
      doses with equivalent effects on heart rate (2 microg kg(-1) nisoldipine; 10
      microg kg(-1) nifedipine) acute dosing with nisoldipine caused a significantly
      greater fall in systemic vascular resistance and increase in cardiac index,
      whilst nifedipine caused a greater reduction in stroke volume index and left
      ventricular stroke work index. 5. The results suggest that, when combined with
      atenolol, acute dosing with nisoldipine may have a more complementary
      haemodynamic profile than nifedipine. The implications of this finding for
      chronic oral dosing in patients with impaired left ventricular function should be
      evaluated.

      chronic stable angina: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 191-9
AB  - We conducted a randomised controlled trial to study the effects of metoprolol and
      diltiazem on the total ischaemic burden--sum of symptomatic and silent myocardial
      ischaemia, in 146 patients with stable angina pectoris. One-hundred thirty-four
      completed the study protocol. Sixty-eight patients received metoprolol (100 mg
      twice daily, n = 52, 50 mg twice daily, n = 16) while 66 received diltiazem (90
      mg three times daily, n = 50, 60 mg three times daily, n = 16). The drugs were
      given for 4 weeks. The primary outcome variables were frequency and duration of
      total ischaemic burden, silent and symptomatic myocardial ischaemia. These were
      measured on 48 h of Holter monitoring. The reductions in duration and frequency
      of total ischaemic burden by metoprolol, 76% and 40%, respectively, were
      significantly higher than by diltiazem, 43% and 24%, respectively (P < 0.01 and P
      < 0.02). The frequency and duration of silent myocardial ischaemia, which
      constituted more than 80% of the total ischaemic burden in the two groups showed 
      similar results. However, the reduction in frequency of symptomatic myocardial
      ischaemia only was significantly greater by metoprolol (63% than diltiazem (24%) 
      as the difference in reduction of duration of symptomatic ischaemia was
      insignificant (85% vs. 75%; P > 0.05). Whether a greater reduction of total
      ischaemic burden by metoprolol as compared to diltiazem has any implications for 
      prognosis in patients with chronic stable angina remains to be established.

      that the time to the onset of pain and occurrence of 1 mm ST segment depression
      improved significantly (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001 respectively) whilst on the fixed 
      combination compared to atenolol alone. In order to achieve sufficient
      sensitivity in the analysis of the exercise times, novel statistical methods
      based on survival analysis were used. Maximum ST segment depression was 0.13 mm
      less (P < 0.04) while on the fixed combination. The incidence of withdrawals and 
      adverse effects was similar on both treatments.

TI  - Sotalol. An updated review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use 
      in cardiac arrhythmias.
PG  - 678-719
AB  - Sotalol is a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist which prolongs cardiac
      repolarisation independently of its antiadrenergic action (class III
      antiarrhythmic properties). The antiarrhythmic action of sotalol appears to arise
      predominantly from its class III properties, and the drug exhibits a broader
      antiarrhythmic profile than the conventional beta-blockers. Sotalol is effective 
      in controlling paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias and the ventricular
      response to atrial fibrillation/flutter in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, in
      maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation/flutter, and 
      in preventing initiation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias following coronary 
      artery bypass surgery. Sotalol shows promise in the control of nonmalignant and
      life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, particularly those associated with
      ischaemic heart disease. It is effective in suppressing complex forms of
      ventricular ectopy, displaying superior antiectopic activity to propranolol and
      metoprolol. The acute efficacy of sotalol in preventing reinduction of sustained 
      ventricular tachyarrhythmias and suppressing spontaneous episodes of these
      arrhythmias on Holter monitoring is translated into long term prophylactic
      efficacy against arrhythmia recurrence in approximately 55 to 85% of patients
      with refractory life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, sotalol
      offers the advantage over the class I agents of reducing cardiac and all-cause
      mortality in the high risk population with life-threatening ventricular
      arrhythmias. The adverse effects of sotalol are primarily related to its
      beta-blocking activity and its class III property of prolonging cardiac
      repolarisation. Sotalol is devoid of overt cardiodepressant activity in patients 
      with mild or moderate left ventricular dysfunction. The overall arrhythmogenic
      potential is moderately low, but torsade de pointes may develop in conjunction
      with excessive prolongation of the QT interval due to bradycardia, hypokalaemia
      or high plasma concentrations of the drug. In summary, sotalol displays a broad
      spectrum of antiarrhythmic activity, is haemodynamically well tolerated, and
      confers a relatively low proarrhythmic risk. It is likely to prove particularly
      appropriate in the treatment and prophylaxis of life-threatening ventricular
      tachyarrhythmias.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antihypertensive efficacy of once-daily amlodipine 
      versus nitrendipine with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in
      essential hypertension.
PG  - 513-8
AB  - We compared the antihypertensive efficacy of once-daily amlodipine (AM) versus
      nitrendipine (NTR) by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (24-h ABPM) in 32
      patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (EH). After a 2-week
      single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients were randomized in a double-blind, 
      parallel fashion: 14 received AM 5 mg and 18 NTR 10 mg. After 2 weeks, dose was
      adjusted if necessary (AM 10 mg or NTR 20 mg) and continued for another 6-week
      period. At the end of the placebo period and during the last week of treatment,
      patients underwent 24-h ABPM. Initial office BP mean values were similar in both 
      groups (169.8 +/- 14/102.5 +/- 6 vs. 167.1 +/- 14/98.7 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively,
      p = NS). A comparable decrease in office mean values of systolic BP (SBP, -22.3
      +/- 13 vs. -19.1 +/- 16 mm Hg) and diastolic BP (DBP, -12.0 +/- 5 vs. -8.1 +/- 8 
      mm Hg) was observed. Nevertheless, 24-h ABPM mean values differed significantly
      between patients treated with AM or NTR with regard to 24-h SBP (120.0 +/- 10 vs.
      132.5 +/- 1 mm Hg, p = 0.01). Moreover, the average decrease in 24-h SBP (-19.3
      +/- 6 vs. -5.2 +/- 11 mm Hg, p = 0.0036) and 24-h DBP (-10.7 +/- 4 vs. -3.7 +/- 6
      mm Hg, p = 0.0047) was higher in the AM group, with no changes in 24-h heart rate
      (HR). At equivalent once-daily dosage, AM was more effective than NTR in
      decreasing BP assessed by 24-h ABPM.

TI  - Bepridil improves left ventricular performance in patients with angina pectoris.
PG  - 474-80
AB  - Patients with coronary artery disease and angina pectoris have abnormalities of
      left ventricular (LV) diastolic performance. These abnormalities, which exist
      when the patients are at rest and not experiencing angina, are presumably
      secondary to abnormalities of intracellular calcium metabolism. Twenty-three
      patients with chronic exertional angina pectoris participated in a
      placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over trial of bepridil hydrochloride.
      Angina frequency, nitroglycerin (NTG) consumption, and treadmill exercise
      capacity were assessed, and each patient underwent first-pass radionuclide
      cineangiography while receiving placebo or bepridil to assess LV performance.
      Bepridil decreased angina frequency from 8.5 +/- 0.6 to 4.4 +/- 1.5 episodes per 
      week (p < 0.01) and NTG consumption from 7.2 +/- 2.4 to 3.6 +/- 1.5 tablets per
      week (p < 0.01). Total treadmill exercise time, time to onset of angina, and time
      to 1-mm ST segment depression increased significantly during bepridil therapy.
      Cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and ejection fraction (EF) increased at 
      rest and during peak upright bicycle exercise. Peak ejection rate and peak
      filling rate increased, and time to peak ejection rate and time to peak filling
      rate decreased at rest and at peak exercise during bepridil therapy. In addition,
      early diastolic filling fraction increased and atrial filling volume decreased
      during bepridil treatment. Bepridil is effective as monotherapy for treatment of 
      patients with exertional angina; its use is associated with increased exercise
      capacity and decreased angina frequency and NTG consumption as well as improved
      LV systolic and diastolic performance at rest and during peak exercise.

TI  - [Acute effects of nicardipine on the vascular reactivity of oxygen in patients
      with respiratory insufficiency and pulmonary hypertension].
PG  - 899-906
AB  - Pulmonary vascular response to the inhalation of various concentrations of oxygen
      (FIO2) was studied under basal conditions and after nicardipine in 10 patients
      with pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic bronchitis. Hemodynamic data and
      blood gases were measured during inhalation of 3 gas mixtures: hypoxia (FIO2 =
      0.15), normoxia (FIO2 = 0.21) and hyperoxia (FIO2 = 0.30). Each gas mixture was
      administered for 20 minutes, initially during an infusion of placebo and then of 
      nicardipine giving a steady plasma concentration of 29 +/- 4 ng/ml. This was
      obtained by continuous I.V. infusion of 0.06 mg/kg/hour. Under basal conditions
      with placebo, the heart rate, cardiac output and pulmonary hypertension increased
      with decreasing concentrations of inhaled oxygen. The systemic blood pressure was
      unchanged with hypoxia but decreased during hyperoxia. Nicardipine increased the 
      heart rate and the cardiac output but reduced the blood pressure with every
      inhaled oxygen mixture. The blood pressure was independent of FIO2 and the
      reduction observed during hyperoxia with placebo no longer occurred with
      nicardipine. However, the pulmonary hypertension was unaffected. At the dosage
      used in this study, nicardipine modified the systemic vascular response to oxygen
      but not the pulmonary vascular response. The vasodilation induced was much
      greater in the systemic than in the pulmonary circulation. In relation to the
      absence of significant pulmonary vasodilation, no changes in blood gases, due to 
      a possible pulmonary shunting effect, were observed. At this dosage, nicardipine 
      is ineffective in reducing pulmonary hypertension. However, its systemic
      hypotensive action may be used in patients with respiratory failure due to
      chronic bronchitis without deleterious effects on blood gases.

AB  - In the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trial II (DAVIT II), treatment with verapamil 
      360 mg/day improved reinfarction-free survival compared with administration of
      placebo. Verapamil appears to effectively prevent reinfarction and sudden death, 
      i.e. sudden events (hazard ratio 0.78 compared with placebo, 95% confidence
      limits 0.62 to 0.99). In a retrospective analysis of data from DAVIT II,
      verapamil treatment in patients with systemic hypertension prevented reinfarction
      significantly better than placebo (15 of 149 verapamil recipients compared with
      27 of 152 placebo recipients reinfarcted, p = 0.04). Similarly, first
      cardiovascular events, i.e. first reinfarction, first stroke or death, were
      prevented more effectively by verapamil treatment than by administration of
      placebo (29 verapamil recipients vs 42 placebo recipients had first
      cardiovascular events, p = 0.07).

TI  - Effects of eplerenone, enalapril, and eplerenone/enalapril in patients with
      essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy: the 4E-left ventricular 
      hypertrophy study.
PG  - 1831-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity correlates
      with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and cardiovascular risk, but the relative
      contributions of angiotensin II and aldosterone remain unclear. This study
      compared LVH regression during treatment with the selective aldosterone blocker
      eplerenone, enalapril, and their combination in patients with hypertension.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: A 9-month, double-blind, randomized study was performed in
      202 patients with LVH and hypertension who received eplerenone 200 mg daily,
      enalapril 40 mg daily, or eplerenone 200 mg and enalapril 10 mg daily. At week 8,
      hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg and/or amlodipine 10 mg was added if diastolic 
      blood pressure was >90 mm Hg. Change in left ventricular (LV) mass as assessed by
      MRI was the primary end point. Change in blood pressure,
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hormones, albuminuria, and safety were also 
      assessed. Eplerenone significantly reduced LV mass from baseline (-14.5+/-3.36 g;
      n=50) similarly to enalapril (-19.7+/-3.20 g; n=54; P=0.258), but
      eplerenone/enalapril (-27.2+/-3.39 g; n=49) was more effective than eplerenone
      alone (P=0.007). All treatments reduced systolic blood pressure and diastolic
      blood pressure from baseline (eplerenone, -23.8 and -11.9 mm Hg; enalapril, -24.7
      and -13.4 mm Hg; and eplerenone/enalapril, -28.7 and -14.4 mm Hg, P=0.048, in
      systolic blood pressure compared with eplerenone alone). Cough was more common
      with enalapril than with eplerenone (P=0.033), and elevated potassium was more
      common with eplerenone. CONCLUSIONS: Eplerenone was as effective as enalapril in 
      LVH regression and blood pressure control. The combination of eplerenone and
      enalapril was more effective in reducing LV mass and systolic blood pressure than
      eplerenone alone.

TI  - Glucagon in beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdoses: a systematic
      review.
PG  - 595-602
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucagon is usually accepted as part of the standard treatment in the
      management of patients with beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdoses.
      METHODS: A systematic review was done in order to evaluate the evidence
      supporting glucagon use in beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdoses.
      Studies evaluating glucagon for those uses were identified using the Cochrane
      Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MedLine,
      ToxLine, and EMBASE searches, as well as reviewing medical toxicology textbooks
      and references of identified articles. Only controlled studies of human or animal
      studies were included, the latter only when it was an in vivo model of acute
      poisoning. The quality of the included studies was assessed. RESULTS: The search 
      found no study in humans but identified 30 in animals. In the five studies of
      animal models of beta-blocker overdose included, glucagon appeared to
      consistently increase the heart rate at least transiently but appeared to have no
      effect on mean arterial pressure even though it possibly increased cardiac
      output. Its effect on the survival rate in animal models of beta-blocker overdose
      was unclear. In the six studies of animal models of calcium channel blocker
      overdose included, glucagon appeared to increase heart rate and cardiac output
      and reverse second and third degree AV blocks, all at least transiently. There
      appeared to be no effect of glucagon on mean arterial pressure although it did
      increase in one model. Glucagon appeared to have no effect on survival rate. The 
      included studies for both overdoses were not blinded, had limited numbers of
      animals, and some had inadequate glucagon regime. CONCLUSION: The evidence
      supporting the use of glucagon in the management of patients with beta-blocker
      and calcium channel blocker overdoses is limited to animal studies.

TI  - Current trends in large cell lymphoma.
PG  - 1948-60
AB  - For the last decade, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone
      (CHOP) has been the best available standard of care for aggressive non-Hodgkin's 
      lymphoma (NHL), based on equivalent therapeutic results with other multiagent
      chemotherapy accompanied by lower costs and lesser toxicity. However, only 40-45%
      of these patients are cured with CHOP. New treatment strategies have been
      employed, including the addition of Rituximab to CHOP in elderly patients; dose
      escalation using granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor; overcoming the multidrug 
      resistance phenotype with infusional chemotherapeutic regimens and use of some
      newer agents. Furthermore, the International Prognostic Factor index (IPI) has
      permitted identification of subsets of patients with large variations in
      prognosis, allowing prognosis specific therapy to be tested. There is now
      accumulating evidence that the clinical behavior of certain NHL can be profiled
      by the expression of certain molecular markers, which will undoubtedly play a
      role in the development of new prognostic models that may refine our ability to
      identify poor-risk patients. Regardless, there is still significant opportunity
      for improving survival in large cell lymphomas.

TI  - Prolongation of the QT interval in palliative care patients.
PG  - 855-9
AB  - Prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) is associated with an
      increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. Many drugs used in
      palliative medicine increase the QT interval and several have had their licenses 
      withdrawn or severely restricted. The relative importance of prolonged QT
      interval will increase for palliative medicine physicians when dealing with
      patients with longer prognoses and especially cardiac disease. Given these safety
      concerns, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of a prolonged QT
      interval in palliative care patients who were not in the terminal stage and were 
      referred to a specialist service. Of 300 patients, 47 (16%) had prolonged QTc but
      only two had QT >500ms. The presence of coexistent cardiac disease or high levels
      of serum alkaline phosphatase appear to be the clinical features most robustly
      associated with a prolonged QTc. Although prolonged QTc is relatively common in
      patients referred to a specialist palliative care service, severely prolonged QT 
      is rare.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers for reducing cardiac morbidity after noncardiac surgery:
      a meta-analysis.
PG  - 634-41
AB  - Cardiac complications are the leading cause of death after noncardiac surgery.
      Despite theoretical benefits, calcium channel blockers (CCB) are not widely used 
      in the perioperative setting. This systematic review assessed the efficacy of
      CCBs during noncardiac surgery. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, PubMed, 
      and reference lists were searched without language restriction for randomized
      controlled trials (RCT) evaluating CCBs during noncardiac surgery. Two reviewers 
      independently abstracted data on death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia,
      supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVT), and congestive heart failure (CHF).
      Treatment effects were calculated as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence
      intervals (CI). Eleven studies (1007 patients) were included. CCBs significantly 
      reduced ischemia (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30-0.80; P = 0.004) and SVT (RR, 0.52; 95% 
      CI, 0.37-0.72; P < 0.0001). CCBs were associated with trends towards reduced
      death and MI. In post hoc analyses, CCBs significantly reduced death/MI (RR,
      0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.86; P = 0.02) and major morbid events (MME), defined as
      death, MI, or CHF (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17-0.89; P = 0.02). In subgroup analyses, 
      diltiazem significantly reduced ischemia, SVT, death/MI, and MMEs. This
      meta-analysis shows CCBs significantly reduced ischemia, SVT, and combined
      end-points in the setting of noncardiac surgery. The majority of these benefits
      are attributable to diltiazem, suggesting the need for further evaluation of this
      drug in a large RCT.

TI  - Statins: new data in secondary prevention and diabetes. Pravastatin and
      simvastatin are the best-assessed statins.
PG  - 143-8
AB  - The efficacy of pravastatin and simvastatin was first shown several years ago in 
      patients with coronary heart disease. Other trials have since been published. In 
      the HPS trial, which studied patients with coronary heart disease, other
      cardiovascular conditions, or diabetes, simvastatin significantly reduced the
      risk of death, coronary events and stroke when compared with placebo. In the
      ALLHAT-LLT trial, in patients with treated hypertension, pravastatin did not
      reduce overall mortality. In the PROSPER trial, in patients aged over 70 with
      cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors, pravastatin reduced the
      incidence of coronary events relative to placebo, but did not reduce overall
      mortality. Pharmacovigilance studies suggest there is no difference between these
      four statins in terms of their potential to cause rhabdomyolysis. Taken together,
      these trials show that statin use can be extended to patients with levels of
      LDL-cholesterol over 2.4 mmol/l (0.9 g/l) if they have coronary heart disease
      (and no hypercholesterolaemia), a history of ischaemic stroke, or lower-limb
      arterial disease. Statins can also be prescribed for diabetic patients with no
      signs of cardiovascular disease but whose LDL-cholesterol exceeds 3.4 mmol/l (1.3
      g/l). Clinical trial data support the use of pravastatin or simvastatin in these 
      situations, at a dose of 20 or 40 mg daily. Plasma creatine phosphokinase assay
      should be done if muscle symptoms occur or if the patient has a particular risk
      of rhabdomyolysis.

TI  - Results of a pilot pharmacotherapy quality improvement program using fixed-dose, 
      combination amlodipine/benazepril antihypertensive therapy in a long-term care
      setting.
PG  - 1872-87
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is common in older adults (aged > or =65 years).
      Treatment frequently requires multiple medications and can be expensive.
      OBJECTIVE: This study measured the impact of substituting low-dose,
      fixed-combination therapy using the calcium channel blocker (CCB) amlodipine and 
      the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazepril for high-dose CCB
      monotherapy or dual therapy with a CCB and an ACE inhibitor on antihypertensive
      drug costs, the incidence of adverse events, and blood-pressure control. METHODS:
      A multicenter, pilot pharmacotherapy quality improvement program was undertaken
      in a long-term care facility setting. Consultant pharmacists reviewed pharmacy
      records and medical charts from long-term care facilities, identifying older
      patients with a diagnosis of hypertension who either took CCB concomitantly with 
      an ACE inhibitor or experienced adverse events on high-dose CCB therapy. Eligible
      patients were identified and their physicians contacted regarding switching them 
      to fixed-dose combination therapy. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients at 17
      facilities were switched to fixed-dose amlodipine/benazepril combination therapy;
      94.1% were women and 5.9% were men (mean age, 85.1 years; range, 64-99 years).
      The mean number of comorbidities was 1.6. During the subsequent 2 months, mean
      blood pressure remained at levels similar to those at baseline. The number of
      patients reporting at least 1 drug-related adverse event decreased by 81.8% (P < 
      0.05), and the incidence of edema decreased by 75.0%. The mean per-patient cost
      of antihypertensive drugs decreased by 33.1% (P < 0.001), a mean per-patient
      savings of 19.21 US dollars per month. CONCLUSION: In patients aged > or =65
      years with hypertension in long-term care facilities, a change from high-dose CCB
      monotherapy or CCB/ACE-inhibitor dual therapy to fixed-dose combination
      amlodipine/benazepril therapy significantly reduced drug costs and the incidence 
      of adverse events and maintained blood-pressure control.

TI  - Preterm delivery: an overview.
PG  - 687-704
AB  - Preterm delivery is the leading factor causing neonatal mortality and morbidity. 
      We have conducted a PubMed literature search to obtain an update on the etiology,
      diagnostic problems and therapeutic considerations of preterm delivery.
      Approximately 5-10% of all births are premature. Preterm labor is associated with
      preterm rupture of membranes, cervical incompetence, polyhydramnion, fetal and
      uterine anomalies, infections, social factors, stress, smoking, heavy work and
      other risk factors. The diagnosis is made on the patients presenting symptoms,
      clinical findings and of progressive effacement and dilatation of the cervix.
      Biochemical markers of preterm delivery are of minor importance in daily clinical
      work. Measurement of the cervix, however, is a practical and valuable tool to
      predict preterm delivery. Cervical cerclage can be useful in selected cases.
      Antibiotics may help to prevent preterm labor in cases of known etiologic agents 
      (e.g. preterm rupture of membranes and urinary infection). The use of tocolytic
      agents such as beta-sympathetic receptor stimulators can be advocated for a few
      days. There is evidence that their long-term use is not beneficial and could even
      be harmful to the fetus. Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) and a new
      selective oxytocin receptor antagonist, atosiban, appear to be as effective as
      beta-sympathomimetic drugs on uterine contractions with fewer side-effects.
      Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors such as indomethacin may prevent uterine
      contractions and can be used prior to the 32nd week of pregnancy. A single course
      of corticosteroid treatment in two doses of 12 mg betamethasone or 6 mg of
      dexamethasone is important for the prevention of respiratory distress between the
      24th and 34th weeks of pregnancy. Multiple doses may be harmful and should be
      avoided. In these cases management should depend on gestation age (fetal
      maturity). Uterine contractions after 34 weeks' gestation are not an indication
      for tocolytic treatment.

TI  - Levosimendan: a new dual-action drug in the treatment of acute heart failure.
PG  - 410-6
AB  - Levosimendan is a new agent for the treatment of acute heart failure.
      Levosimendan acts via complementary mechanisms; it enhances contractility by
      sensitising cardiac myofilaments to calcium and dilates blood vessels by opening 
      ATP-dependent potassium channels. In contrast to traditional inotropes
      (beta-agonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors), levosimendan does not raise
      myocyte calcium levels and is therefore less likely to elicit arrhythmias or to
      impair diastolic relaxation. The clinical efficacy of levosimendan is supported
      by four key clinical studies, including more than 900 patients hospitalised for
      cardiac decompensation due to acutely worsened chronic heart failure or to heart 
      failure following myocardial infarction. When given as short-term therapy,
      levosimendan enhances cardiac output, reduces systemic vascular resistance and
      lowers pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 31 days post-treatment, mortality
      rates were halved in decompensated chronic heart failure patients who received
      levosimendan, compared with those on dobutamine--an advantage sustained at 180
      days. Similar survival gains were observed among acute failure patients treated
      with levosimendan following myocardial infarction. With its substantial
      haemodynamic and survival benefits, levosimendan is well suited to be part of
      routine management for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure.

TI  - Effect of elevated heart rate preceding the onset of ventricular tachycardia on
      antitachycardia pacing effectiveness in patients with implantable cardioverter
      defibrillators.
PG  - 26-32
AB  - The incorporation of antitachycardia pacing (ATP) into implantable cardioverter
      defibrillators (ICDs) has provided a better tolerated alternative to shocks. ATP 
      has been shown to be effective in terminating approximately 80% to 90% of
      spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) episodes. Although ATP is routinely
      used, little is known about predictors of ATP failure. Based on the evaluation of
      stored electrograms, we aimed to prospectively follow patients with ICDs, and to 
      analyze parameters affecting ATP effectiveness. One hundred eighteen consecutive 
      patients received ICDs for standard indications. Before discharge, empirical,
      standardized ATP therapy was programmed in all patients within VT zones. A total 
      of 1,218 spontaneous tachycardia episodes occurred in 51 patients during a mean
      follow-up of 24.5 +/- 12 months. Among these, 888 VTs were diagnosed. One hundred
      four fast VTs were detected in the ventricular fibrillation zone and treated with
      primary shock delivery. ATP was attempted 881 times in the remaining 784 VT
      episodes. ATP terminated 640 VTs successfully, ATP failed in 55 VTs finally
      reverted by shocks, and 89 VTs converted to a slower VT outside the VT zone.
      Fifty-one of these slower VTs reverted spontaneously, and 38 were redetected and 
      treated. Finally, in primary intention-to-treat basis, ATP was successful in 691 
      VTs (88%) and unsuccessful in 93 VTs (12%). There was no influence of VT cycle
      length on ATP success rate. Furthermore, ATP efficacy was similar between
      patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35% or >35%, between
      daytime and nighttime, as well as between patients with ischemic or nonischemic
      cardiomyopathy. A faster heart rate immediately preceding the onset of VT (103
      +/- 19 vs 78 +/- 14 beats/min, respectively, hazard ratio 4.08, 95% confidence
      interval 2.11 to 7.89, p <0.001), and absence of beta-blocker therapy (82% vs
      93%, respectively, hazard ratio 2.71, 95% confidence interval 1.72 to 4.29, p =
      0.02) were found, by Cox proportional-hazard analysis, to be the sole independent
      predictors of ATP ineffectiveness in ICD recipients. Thus, the present study
      identified both preceding sinus tachycardia (reflecting an increased sympathetic 
      tone) and lack of beta-blocker use as independent risk factors for reduced
      success of ATP therapy in terminating VT. Therefore, modification of sympathetic 
      tone may be beneficial for patients with ICDs.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of sibutramine in overweight Hispanic patients with
      hypertension.
PG  - 101-13
AB  - This 6-month randomized study evaluated the safety and efficacy of sibutramine in
      57 overweight Hispanic patients with hypertension. Following a 2-week washout to 
      confirm the diagnosis of hypertension, antihypertensive medication was adjusted
      to achieve a blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg before institution of either
      sibutramine 10 mg or placebo once a day. A body mass index in excess of 27 kg/m2 
      was required for entry. At study end, weight had changed from 75.4+/-9.6 to
      70.0+/-9.5 kg in the sibutramine group and from 77.9+/-9.0 to 74.5+/-9.4 kg in
      the placebo group. In the sibutramine group, systolic blood pressure was
      127.8+/-5.8 mm Hg after stabilization and 125.2+/-8.5 mm Hg after completion of
      the trial; respective values for diastolic blood pressure were 82.4+/-3.7 and
      81.5+/-4.6 mm Hg. With placebo, blood pressure dropped from
      129.0+/-7.1/80.9+/-4.9 mm Hg to 122.8+/-9.7/80.3+/-5.4 mm Hg at the same
      timepoints. In the sibutramine group, 14 patients reported 21 adverse events,
      most frequently headache (n=5), constipation (n=4), and dry mouth (n=4). In the
      placebo group, 13 patients had 20 adverse events. Sibutramine is safe and
      effective in overweight Hispanic patients with hypertension, but monitoring of
      blood pressure and titration of antihypertensive medication are necessary.

TI  - Achieving goal blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes: conventional
      versus fixed-dose combination approaches.
PG  - 202-9
AB  - Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
      demonstrate that only 11% of people with diabetes who are treated for high blood 
      pressure achieve the blood pressure goal of <130/85 mm Hg recommended in the
      sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection,
      Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI). The current study
      tests the hypothesis that initial therapy with a fixed-dose combination will
      achieve the recommended blood pressure goal in patients with type 2 diabetes
      faster than conventional monotherapy. This randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study had as a primary end point achievement of blood pressure
      <130/85 mm Hg. Participants (N=214) with hypertension and type 2 diabetes
      received either amlodipine/benazepril 5/10 mg (combination) or enalapril 10 mg
      (conventional) once daily for 4 weeks, titrated to 5/20 mg/day or 20 mg/day,
      respectively at this time, if target blood pressure was not achieved.
      Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg/day was added for the final 4 weeks, if target
      blood pressure was still not reached. Time from baseline to achieve blood
      pressure <130/85 mm Hg was shorter in the combination group (5.3+/-3.1 weeks
      combination vs. 6.4+/-3.8 weeks conventional; p=0.001). At 3 months, more
      participants in the combination group achieved treatment goal (63% combination
      vs. 37% conventional; p=0.002). Data analysis at 3 months comparing blood
      pressure control rates between the fixed-dose combination group (without HCTZ) to
      the conventional group (receiving HCTZ) showed an even greater disparity in blood
      pressure goal achievement (87% combination without HCTZ vs. 37% conventional
      group with HCTZ; p=0.0001). We conclude that initial therapy with a fixed-dose
      combination may be more efficacious than conventional monotherapy approaches for 
      achieving blood pressure goals in the diabetic patient. A fixed-dose combination 
      approach appears as safe as the current conventional approaches.

TI  - Isotretinoin use and subsequent depression and suicide: presenting the evidence.
PG  - 493-505
AB  - The growing number of reported cases of depression and suicide associated with
      isotretinoin (a retinoid receptor agonist) use in patients with acne has prompted
      concern among dermatologists, patients, and their relatives and has triggered new
      warnings from regulators including depression-related, patient-informed consent
      forms. In establishing a cause-effect relationship, it is useful to judiciously
      consider whether there is an association, what is the nature of that association,
      if there is a plausible biological mechanism of action, the validity and
      reliability of measures used and the strength of study designs. Hoffmann-La Roche
      estimates that by April 2001 approximately 12 million patients worldwide have
      used isotretinoin, with 5 million patients in the US.A MEDLINE search between
      January 1966 and May 14 2003 of the published medical literature found 24
      documented cases of isotretinoin-associated depression, with 3 suicides. One
      additional patient committed suicide during the fourth month of isotretinoin
      treatment and 3 further patients attempted suicide by taking an overdose of
      isotretinoin. The US FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) contains almost 
      23,000 reports for isotretinoin from its approval in 1982 to December 2002. As of
      November 30, 2002, AERS contained 3,104 reports (US and foreign) with at least
      one reported psychiatric event. The FDA is aware of 173 reports of suicide (both 
      US and foreign) in association with isotretinoin. Reports of positive dechallenge
      and rechallenge present a strong signal pointing to an association between
      isotretinoin and depression. A Hoffmann-La Roche sponsored epidemiological study 
      failed to find any evidence of an association between isotretinoin and depression
      or suicide. However, the design of the study was flawed and the evidence was
      deemed inconclusive. Further studies using strong study designs, reliable and
      valid measures, and adequate sample sizes may bring us closer to the answer. The 
      evidence suggesting a relationship between isotretinoin and depression needs to
      be weighed against the increasing prevalence of depression among adolescents and 
      young adults and the psychological impact of acne. The literature contains
      credible evidence that isotretinoin treatment may reduce the psychosocial impact 
      of acne in some patients. At the present time, there is no known pharmacological 
      mechanism that would account for psychiatric symptomatology as a result of
      isotretinoin treatment; however, retinoid receptors are widely distributed in the
      brain and more research is needed to ascertain whether they have a role in
      depression. In the meantime, for the practitioner, the obvious benefit of
      isotretinoin in treating acne should encourage continued use. However, patients
      and their relatives must be informed and depressive symptoms should be actively
      assessed at each visit and, if necessary, referral to a psychiatrist,
      antidepressant therapy or discontinuation of isotretinoin should be considered.

TI  - Concepts in pathogenesis and treatment of chronic anal fissure--a review of the
      literature.
PG  - 968-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic anal fissures are associated with a persistent hypertonia and 
      spasm of the internal anal sphincter. Classic treatment is surgical
      sphincterotomy to reduce the anal tone and eliminate sphincteric spasm. However, 
      concerns have been raised about the incidence of fecal incontinence after
      surgery. Therefore, pharmacological means to treat chronic anal fissures have
      been explored. METHODS: We conducted a literature review on MEDLINE database.
      RESULTS: All treatments address the anomaly of a high anal pressure. Several
      studies have investigated the effect of topical glyceryl trinitrate ointment.
      Healing rates range from 30% to 86%. Therapy is limited because of a high
      incidence of moderate to severe headaches in up to 84% of patients. Comparable
      results are observed after injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter
      (43-96%). Minor incontinence for flatus and soiling has been reported in up to
      12% of patients. Further pharmacological approaches including treatment via
      calcium channel blockade and treatment with alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists are
      still at a developmental stage. CONCLUSIONS: Topical glyceryl trinitrate ointment
      and injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter are advocated as the
      first-line treatment for chronic anal fissure. Lateral sphincterotomy should be
      offered to patients with relapse and therapeutic failure of prior pharmacological
      treatment.

TI  - Effects of amlodipine on ischemia after percutaneous transluminal coronary
      angioplasty: secondary results of the Coronary Angioplasty Amlodipine Restenosis 
      (CAPARES) Study.
PG  - 1030-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite successful coronary angioplasty (PTCA), patients may have
      ischemia after the procedure because of the overall coronary disease and luminal 
      renarrowing at the lesion sites. The aim of this study was to examine the effects
      of the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine on post-PTCA ischemia. METHODS: In a
      prospective, double-blind design, patients were randomized to receive 10 mg of
      amlodipine or placebo 2 weeks before angioplasty. Exercise tests and 48-hour
      ambulatory electrocardiography recordings were performed in 405 patients, 2 weeks
      before and 2 and 20 weeks (early and late) after PTCA. RESULTS: There were no
      differences in clinical and angiographic baseline characteristics between the
      treatment groups. Ischemia and angina were equally distributed before PTCA, and
      no difference in restenosis was found between the groups at follow-up. The
      incidence of angina was significantly lower in the amlodipine group compared with
      the placebo group both early and late after PTCA (P =.04 and.03).
      Exercise-induced ischemia was reduced by 40% (P =.009) early and 34% (P =.02)
      late after PTCA in the amlodipine group, and ischemia on ambulatory
      electrocardiography was reduced by 18% early and 28% late after PTCA compared
      with placebo (P =.06 and P =.009). CONCLUSION: Ischemia and angina occurred after
      successful PTCA and were significantly reduced by amlodipine.

TI  - Topical nifedipine vs. topical glyceryl trinitrate for treatment of chronic anal 
      fissure.
PG  - 805-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Nifedipine (administered orally or applied topically) has been effective
      for nonsurgical treatment of anal fissure. We compared the efficacy of nifedipine
      vs. glyceryl trinitrate for chemical sphincterotomy of anal fissure. METHODS: In 
      a prospective, double-blind trial, 52 patients suffering from chronic anal
      fissure were randomly and equally allocated to receive either glyceryl trinitrate
      or nifedipine, both applied topically to the perianal region. The end point of
      the study was healing within a predetermined period (6 months). Variables
      assessed included demographic data (age, gender), symptoms associated with the
      fissure, duration of treatment, percentage of healing, untoward effects of
      treatment, pain scores, duration of follow-up, recurrence, and need for
      complementary means of treatment. Descriptive data are presented as mean +/-
      standard deviation and quantal data as percentage. Inference analysis was
      performed using the Student's t-test for the descriptive data and the chi-squared
      or Fisher's exact test for nominal variables. RESULTS: No significant differences
      were recorded with regard to age, gender, symptoms associated with the fissure,
      or duration of treatment. Healing rate was higher (P < 0.04) with nifedipine (89 
      percent) as compared with glyceryl trinitrate (58 percent). Treatment side
      effects (headache, flushing) were more frequent (P < 0.01) with glyceryl
      trinitrate (40 percent) as compared with nifedipine (5 percent). Pain scores were
      significantly lower (P < 0.03) on completion of treatment in both groups (3.2 in 
      glyceryl trinitrate and 3.4 in nifedipine vs. 6.2 and 6.1, respectively), but did
      not differ between the two groups. Recurrence occurred in 31 percent of patients 
      treated with glyceryl trinitrate and 42 percent of those treated with nifedipine 
      after a mean period of 18 +/- 3 weeks and 12 +/- 4 weeks, respectively.
      CONCLUSION: Topical application of nifedipine for management of chronic anal
      fissure was more effective and had fewer side effects than topical glyceryl
      trinitrate. Recurrence was frequent with both drugs.

TI  - Treatment of resistant anal fissure with advancement anoplasty.
PG  - 463-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to assess the outcome of advancement
      anoplasty in the treatment of chronic anal fissure, resistant to conventional
      therapy. The secondary aim was to evaluate the anal resting pressure in these
      patients with resistant fissures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a five-year period
      eight patients (2 male, median age 55 years, range 20-74) with resistant anal
      fissure were referred from 6 centres. They had endured symptoms for a median of 8
      years (range 2-20) and had undergone a median of 2 previous surgical procedures
      (range 1-3), including lateral sphincterotomy and anal dilatation. Anorectal
      physiological testing was performed on all patients who then underwent
      advancement anoplasty. The outcome was analysed retrospectively. RESULTS:
      Pre-operative anorectal physiological testing showed a significantly lowered
      median maximal anal resting pressure of 42 mm H2O (range 12-72 mm H2O, normal
      range > 60 mm), P=0.03. All patients underwent advancement anoplasty. At a median
      of seven months follow-up (range 2-22) seven of eight patients had healed their
      fissure and were asymptomatic. The median healing time was four months (range
      2-6). CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic anal fissure, resistant to conventional
      therapy, may be successfully treated by advancement anoplasty. Healing time
      however, may be prolonged. In this series patients had a decreased anal resting
      pressure rather than anal hypertonia.

TI  - The role of topical diltiazem in the treatment of chronic anal fissures that have
      failed glyceryl trinitrate therapy.
PG  - 430-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The treatment of anal fissures has evolved over the last 5 years with 
      the development of topical treatments aimed at reducing sphincter hypertonia.
      This is thought to improve anal mucosal blood flow and promote healing of the
      fissure. This study reports the use of topical diltiazem in patients with chronic
      anal fissures that have failed previous treatment with topical 0.2% glyceryl
      trinitrate (GTN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients with chronic anal
      fissure who had previously failed at least one course of topical GTN were
      recruited prospectively from a single centre. Patients were instructed to apply 2
      cm (approximately 0.7 g) of 2% diltiazem cream to the anal verge twice daily for 
      eight weeks. Symptoms of pain, bleeding and itching were recorded on a linear
      analogue score prior to starting the cream and then repeated at 2 weekly
      intervals. Patients were asked to report side-effects throughout the study
      period. Healing of the fissure was assessed after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: 
      Forty-six patients completed treatment; of these, 22 had healed fissures (48%).
      Ten of the 24 patients with persistent fissures were symptomatically improved and
      wished no further treatment. Of the 14 patients who remained symptomatic, one was
      given a repeat course of 0.2% glyceryl trinitrate with subsequent healing of the 
      fissure, 10 were recruited into an ongoing study involving injections of
      botulinum toxin into the internal anal sphincter and three were referred for
      surgery. CONCLUSION: This study shows that topical 2% diltiazem is an effective
      and safe treatment for chronic anal fissure in patients who have failed topical
      0.2% GTN. The need for sphincterotomy can be avoided in up to 70% of cases.

TI  - A prospective randomized trial of diltiazem and glyceryltrinitrate ointment in
      the treatment of chronic anal fissure.
PG  - 256-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare prospectively diltiazem with GTN 
      ointment in the treatment of anal fissure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 43
      outpatients with chronic anal fissure, 22 patients were randomized to topical
      diltiazem (2%) ointment and 21 patients to glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) (0.5%)
      ointment twice daily for 8 weeks. During the course of treatment each patient was
      seen three times. Side-effects and healing were recorded. RESULTS: Healing
      occurred in 19 of 22 patients treated with diltiazem and 18 of 21 patients were
      cured with GTN (P = 0.95). Those who were treated with nitroglycerin ointment
      developed headache and dizziness developed after GTN in 33.3% of cases while no
      patient had any side-effects after diltiazem. CONCLUSIONS: Diltiazem and
      glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) were equally effective in healing anal fissure but the
      former resulted in fewer side-effects.

TI  - Diarrhoea, vomiting and ACE inhibitors:--an important cause of acute renal
      failure.
PG  - 419-23
AB  - The occurrence of severe acute renal failure in 3 patients who developed
      diarrhoea while taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors led us to
      undertake a retrospective cohort survey to determine the frequency with which
      diarrhoea and vomiting are associated with acute renal failure in patients taking
      this class of drug. Serum creatinine was measured as part of the diagnostic
      workup of 2398 consecutive admissions to an acute medical receiving unit in a
      district general hospital. Outcome measures were the presence of diarrhoea and/or
      vomiting, and whether taking an ACE inhibitor, NSAID or diuretic at the time of
      admission, also previous, initial and follow up serum creatinine concentrations. 
      Peak serum creatinine in the 3 cases was 1159, 989 and 765 micromol/l. None of
      the 3 required dialysis and all recovered renal function completely after
      receiving large volumes of intravenous fluid. In the cohort study, 89 of
      2398(3.7%) admissions had serum creatinine >/=200 micromol/l. Nine were regular
      dialysis patients. Of the remaining patients, 30 (37.5%) were taking an ACE
      inhibitor. Six of 30 (20%) gave a history of diarrhoea and/or vomiting. Median
      creatinine concentration in this group was 135 (range 111-209) micromol/l before 
      admission, 292 (216-724) micromol/l when first seen in hospital, and 134 (94-219)
      micromol/l following the withdrawal of drug therapy and fluid replacement. In
      conclusion, volume depletion causing acute renal failure in patients taking ACE
      inhibitors is not uncommon. Such patients and their general practitioners should 
      be aware that reversible renal impairment may occur during intercurrent
      illnesses, particularly if characterised by diarrhoea and/or vomiting.

TI  - Antihypertensive therapy with verapamil SR plus trandolapril versus atenolol plus
      chlorthalidone on glycemic control.
PG  - 381-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence that diuretics and beta blockers impair glucose
      tolerance, whereas calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme
      blockers lack this metabolic effect. We compared the effect of a combination
      therapy with a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker plus an angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor and a beta blocker plus a diuretic on hemoglobin
      A(1c) (Hb A(1c)) in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild-to- moderate
      hypertension. METHODS: A total of 463 hypertensive outpatients with non-insulin
      treated type 2 diabetes on stable antidiabetic therapy for at least 3 months and 
      with HbA(1c) between 6.5% and 10% were recruited. In a randomized, double blind
      trial patients were treated for 20 weeks with fixed combinations of verapamil
      sustained release (SR) plus trandolapril and of atenolol plus chlorthalidone
      following a 2-week placebo run-in period. The main outcome measures were HbA(1c),
      fasting plasma glucose, and fructosamine levels as well as systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure. RESULTS: HbA(1c) remained stable at 7.9% after administration of 
      verapamil SR plus trandolapril and increased from 7.8% to 8.6% with atenolol plus
      chlorthalidone; the differences between treatment groups were significant at 4,
      12, and 20 weeks of treatment and at last visit (P <.0001). Mean blood pressure
      fell from 169/96 to 150/85 and from 168/95 to 145/83 mm Hg after administration
      of verapamil SR plus trandolapril and atenolol plus chlorthalidone, respectively.
      Both combinations were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: HbA(1c) and other parameters 
      of short- and long-term glycemic control were in a more favorable range after
      antihypertensive treatment with verapamil SR plus trandolapril as compared with
      atenolol plus chlorthalidone.

TI  - Long QT syndrome caused by noncardiac drugs.
PG  - 415-27
AB  - Numerous medications not intended for cardiac use (including antibiotics,
      histamine blockers, and antipsychotic medications) incidentally block potassium
      channels in myocardial cells, prolong the QT interval, and may trigger malignant 
      arrhythmias. Although the odds for a given patient for developing arrhythmias are
      small, the number of patients receiving such drugs is enormous. Most patients
      developing proarrhythmia have additional risk factors that could be easily
      identified from their medical history. The list of risk factors includes female
      gender, organic heart disease, hypokalemia, and a history of long QT or
      drug-induced arrhythmias. Patients without risk factors are at very low risk. For
      these patients, it is neither practical nor necessary to record an
      electrocardiogram before therapy is initiated and the most important preventive
      measure is to avoid concurrent administration of 2 or more drugs that prolong the
      QT interval or administration of a medication that impairs the metabolism of a
      QT-prolonging drug. We performed a computerized literature search using the key
      words "long QT," "torsade," "drug-adverse effects," and "drug-ventricular
      arrhythmias," searching for published reports of drug-induced torsade de pointes.

TI  - Evaluation of the effect of the sublingually administered nifedipine and
      captopril via transcranial doppler ultrasonography during hypertensive crisis.
PG  - 46-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to show the effects of sublingually
      administered nifedipine and captopril on middle cerebral arterial blood flow
      during hypertensive crisis in the emergency department. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) was performed on the patients
      fulfilling the criteria (15 patients given captopril, 13 patients given
      nifedipine, mean (+/-SD) age 56 +/- 11 and 54 +/- 10 years, respectively). Then, 
      patients were randomized into sublingually administered captopril or nifedipine
      groups and after the drug administration, TCD was repeated. Initial systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressures were 200 +/- 21/125 +/- 21 mmHg in the captopril group 
      and 199 +/- 17/ 123 +/- 20 mmHg in the nifedipine group. There was no significant
      difference between antihypertensive effects of the drugs after initiation of
      treatment. Before the treatment with captopril, middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow
      velocities (Vm) and pulsatility index (PI) were 76.74 +/- 6.38 cm/s and 1.18 +/- 
      0.09, respectively. The values after the treatment with captopril were 78.21 +/- 
      5.24cm/s (p < 0.05) and 0.92 +/- 0.08 (p < 0.001), respectively. Before the
      treatment with nifedipine, Vm and PIs were 64.73 +/- 5.11 cm/s and 1.14 +/- 0.18,
      respectively. After the treatment with nifedipine, Vm was 60.04 +/- 5.36 cm/s (p 
      < 0.01) and PI was 1.21 +/- 0.09 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: After treatment with
      captopril, PIs were decreased to normal limits but in the group treated with
      nifedipine, PIs increased to more pathological values. These results showed that 
      we should reconsider the use of nifedipine in the emergency departments as an
      antihypertensive agent in hypertensive attack treatment.

TI  - Relative perioperative bradycardia does not lead to adverse outcomes after
      cardiac transplantation.
PG  - 484-91
AB  - Since the effects of bradycardia after cardiac transplantation are not known, we 
      tested the hypothesis that perioperative bradycardia would lead to an increase in
      adverse outcomes after cardiac transplantation. We conducted a retrospective case
      control study with inclusion criterion of a heart rate (HR) less than 80 bpm
      during the 1st week after transplantation. Control patients were matched for
      gender, age and time since transplantation. We identified 34 patients as having
      perioperative bradycardia out of the 174 who underwent cardiac transplantation
      between 1994 and 1997. The results demonstrated no significant differences in
      donor ischemic times (180 vs. 183, p = 0.88), operative surgeon (p = 0.62) or
      pretransplant cardiac disease (p = 0.81) between groups. Bradycardic patients
      were more likely to be on pretransplant amiodarone (RR = 20.4, p < 0.001).
      Perioperative bradycardia did not lead to increases in cellular rejection (p =
      0.72) or vasculopathy (p = 0.79). The patients prescribed pretransplant
      amiodarone (n = 14) had a trend toward delayed time to first rejection episode
      (31.0 vs. 15.5 days, median, p = 0.07). In conclusion, perioperative bradycardia 
      does not increase adverse outcomes after cardiac transplantation and is
      associated with pretransplant use of amiodarone. Amiodarone may modify the
      recipients' immune response by delaying the occurrence of rejection.

TI  - The effect of high dose losartan on erythropoietin resistance in patients
      undergoing haemodialysis.
PG  - 59-62
AB  - AIM: In some of the patients undergoing haemodialysis, (HD) resistance might
      develop against recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) used for treatment of
      anaemia. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that are used
      to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure in HD patients have been
      suggested to contribute to anaemia as well by inhibiting erythropoiesis. Our
      purpose in this study is to investigate whether or not losartan, an angiotensin
      II (ATII) receptor antagonist, is causing rHuEPO resistance. METHODS: In this
      prospective study of 12 months, we compared the effects of high dose losartan
      (100 mg/day) and amlodipine (10 mg/day) on rHuEPO requirement in 40 hypertensive 
      patients receiving rHuEPO for more than 12 months on maintenance HD. Twenty
      normotensive rHuEPO dependent patients served as control group. Iron deficiency, 
      hyperparathyroidism, aluminium intoxication, infections and inflammations were
      excluded in all patients. RESULTS: The mean haemoglobin level was found >8 g/dl
      in all groups. The mean weekly rHuEPO dose increased in the losartan group
      (p<0.0001 vs before) and remained constant in the other groups. No significant
      differences were found with PTH, iron status, aetiologies of renal failure in all
      groups. CONCLUSION: High-dose losartan increases rHuEPO requirement and should be
      reserved for dialysis patients with hypertension uncontrollable with other
      antihypertensive medications.

TI  - Cardiovascular outcomes in the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial of patients 
      with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy.
PG  - 542-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes have increased risk for adverse cardiovascular
      events. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are protective in type 1
      diabetes. However, no definitive studies have examined the use of
      angiotensin-receptor blockers in patients with type 2 diabetes and overt
      nephropathy. The primary outcomes of the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial
      were doubling of serum creatinine levels, end-stage renal disease, and death from
      any cause. OBJECTIVE: To compare rates of cardiovascular events among patients
      with type 2 diabetic nephropathy who received conventional antihypertensive
      therapy with an angiotensin-receptor blocker (irbesartan) or a calcium-channel
      blocker (amlodipine), or placebo. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial with a median follow-up of 2.6 years. A time event
      analysis was used. SETTING: 209 centers in the Americas, Europe, Israel, and
      Australasia. PARTICIPANTS: 1715 adults with type 2 diabetic nephropathy and
      hypertension; serum creatinine levels of 89 micromol/L (1.0 mg/dL) to 266
      micromol/L (3.0 mg/dL) in women and 106 micromol/L (1.2 mg/dL) to 266 micromol/L 
      (3.0 mg/dL) in men; and urinary protein excretion rates of at least 900 mg/d.
      INTERVENTION: Treatment with irbesartan, amlodipine, or placebo. MEASUREMENTS:
      Time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure,
      strokes, and coronary revascularization. RESULTS: The three groups were not
      statistically different in the composite of cardiovascular events. Among the
      components of the composite, there was a trend toward a decrease in strokes in
      patients receiving amlodipine versus those receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.65 
      [95% CI, 0.35 to 1.22]; P = 0.18). Likewise, patients receiving amlodipine had a 
      significantly lower rate of myocardial infarction when compared with placebo
      recipients (hazard ratio, 0.58 [CI, 0.37 to 0.92]; P = 0.02). In contrast,
      patients receiving irbesartan had a significantly lower incidence of congestive
      heart failure when compared with placebo recipients (hazard ratio, 0.72 [CI, 0.52
      to 1.00]; P = 0.048) or amlodipine recipients (hazard ratio, 0.65 [CI, 0.48 to
      0.87]; P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The composite cardiovascular event rate did not
      differ in patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy treated with
      irbesartan, amlodipine, or placebo in addition to conventional antihypertensive
      therapy.

TI  - Treatment of stable angina with low dose diltiazem in combination with the
      metabolic agent trimetazidine.
PG  - 83-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk/benefit of moderate to high doses of calcium antagonists in 
      stable angina is uncertain. This study investigates the efficacy and
      acceptability of low dose diltiazem in combination with trimetazidine for the
      treatment of stable angina. METHODS: In a 28-day, randomized, double blind study,
      treatment with 90 mg diltiazem in combination with 60 mg trimetazidine or placebo
      per day was compared in 50 patients with stable angina. The primary outcomes were
      time to 1-mm ST segment depression and the Duke treadmill score. RESULTS: Of the 
      25 patients in each treatment group, the number (%) of patients responding to
      trimetazidine compared to placebo was, in time to 1-mm ST segment depression, 13 
      (52) versus 5 (20), P<0.05; in the Duke treadmill score, 18 (72) versus 8 (32),
      P<0.01; and in angina 17 (68) versus 3 (12), P<0.01. Compared to placebo there
      was an improvement with trimetazidine in mean exercise time to 1-mm ST segment
      depression of 128 s (95% confidence interval 45.0-208.5; P<0.01); in the mean
      Duke treadmill score of 57.4% (95% confidence interval 9.9-100; P<0.02); and in
      mean anginal attacks of 5.1 per week (95% confidence interval, 3.1-7.3, P<0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: The combination of low dose diltiazem with trimetazidine is effective
      with few side-effects in the symptomatic control of patients with stable angina.

TI  - Health economics in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study: costs and
      cost-effectiveness of intensive blood pressure lowering and low-dose aspirin in
      patients with hypertension.
PG  - 472-80
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the marginal cost-effectiveness of different targets
      for the reduction of blood pressure and the cost-effectiveness of adding
      acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to the treatment of hypertension. DESIGN: Patients
      with hypertension were randomized to three target groups for blood pressure; < or
      =90, < or =85 and < or =80 mmHg. Patients were also randomly assigned ASA and
      placebo. The average follow-up time was 3.8 years. The direct costs for drugs,
      visits, hospitalizations, and side-effects were calculated and related to
      clinical outcome. SETTING: Resource utilization data from all the 26 countries in
      the study were pooled, and Swedish unit costs were applied to the aggregated
      resource utilization. SUBJECTS: A total of 18 790 patients, 50-80 years of age
      (mean 61.5 years), with a diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 115 mmHg (mean
      105 mmHg). INTERVENTIONS: Antihypertensive treatment with the long-acting calcium
      antagonist felodipine was given to all patients. Additional therapy and dose
      increments in four further steps were prescribed to reach the randomized target
      blood pressure. Fifty per cent of the patients were randomized to a low dose, 75 
      mg daily, of acetylsalicylic acid. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct health care
      costs, major cardiovascular (CV) events (myocardial infarction and stroke) and CV
      death. RESULTS: The average cost of drugs and visits increased with more
      intensive treatment. The increase in treatment costs was partly but not fully
      offset by a nonsignificant reduction in the cost of CV hospitalizations. For
      patients with diabetes there were no significant differences in total cost
      between the target groups. The cost of avoiding a major CV event was negative in 
      the base case analysis, SEK -10 360 (CI: -78 195, 75 630), and SEK 18 450 (CI:
      -88 789, 192 980) in a sensitivity analysis. For patients on ASA, costs were
      slightly but significantly higher than for patients on placebo. The estimates of 
      the cost of avoiding a major CV event varied between SEK 41 600 and SEK 477 400, 
      with very wide confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment cost increases as
      the target for hypertension treatment is lowered. In patients with diabetes,
      intensive treatment to a lower target is cost-effective. Because of the
      nonsignificant difference in events, no conclusion can be made for all patients
      in the study. Furthermore, no conclusive evidence was found regarding the
      cost-effectiveness of adding ASA to the treatment of hypertension.

TI  - Esmolol blunts the cerebral blood flow velocity increase during emergence from
      anesthesia in neurosurgical patients.
PG  - 1145-9, table of contents
AB  - Cerebral hyperemia has been demonstrated during emergence from anesthesia in
      neurosurgical patients, but its mechanism is speculative. We performed this study
      to test the hypothesis that this could be attributed to sympathetic overactivity.
      Thirty neurosurgical patients were included in a prospective, randomized,
      double-blinded study comparing esmolol, a short-acting beta-blocker, and a
      placebo. Esmolol (0.3 mg. kg(-1). min(-1)) was infused from the end of anesthesia
      to 15 min after extubation. Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), mean arterial
      blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded before anesthesia, during anesthesia
      after surgery, at extubation, and 5-60 min after extubation. Cardiac output (COe)
      was estimated by using an esophageal Doppler from anesthesia to 60 min after
      extubation. CBFV, COe, and heart rate were significantly lower in the esmolol
      group. Mean arterial blood pressure was comparable between the groups. There was 
      no correlation between CBFV and COe at any time point during the study. In
      conclusion, esmolol blunted the CBFV increase during emergence, confirming that
      sympathetic overactivity contributes to cerebral hyperemia during neurosurgical
      recovery. IMPLICATIONS: Esmolol blunted the postoperative increase in cerebral
      blood flow velocity in neurosurgical patients. The origin of sympathetic
      hyperactivity and its potential deleterious consequences require further study.

TI  - Treatment of the scorpion envenoming syndrome: 12-years experience with
      serotherapy.
PG  - 170-4
AB  - The pathophysiology of the scorpion envenoming syndrome is described with
      emphasis on the body systems commonly affected. Concepts of the mechanisms
      underlying venom action, as can be explained by the recently discovered effects
      on ionic channels, are discussed. A protocol for the treatment of scorpion stings
      based mainly on antivenom therapy was applied nationwide in Saudi Arabia. A list 
      of drugs with alternatives was specified to be used in adjunctive therapy, when
      required. Analysis of the outcome from 1,033 cases at Al-Baha region, 791 cases
      at Al-Qassim region and more than 2,000 cases from 12 central and specialist
      hospitals in the Central Province, Saudi Arabia gave impressive results. The
      incidence of severe venom toxicity following antivenom administration was almost 
      negligible. The period of stay in the hospital was reduced. The early reaction to
      antivenom administration was lower than expected the severity of the reaction
      consisting mainly of skin rashes, urticaria, wheezing and bronchial
      hypersensitivity, but no anaphylaxis. About 13.8% of the victims had been
      previously treated with antivenom but only 1.7% of the patients showed positive
      skin tests. This might be due to the low protein content of the antivenom and the
      action of the venom in releasing massive amounts of catecholamines.

TI  - An update on the controversies of tocolytic therapy for the prevention of preterm
      birth.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Preterm birth is the major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity in the
      developed world. Where there are no contraindications to their use, tocolytics
      can improve neonatal survival rates by approximately 3% per day between 23 and 27
      weeks gestation with a concomitant reduction in morbidity. The ultimate aim of
      tocolytic therapy is to prolong pregnancy until growth and maturation is
      complete, but even short-term delay may enable the administration of antepartum
      glucocorticoids to reduce hyaline membrane disease or to arrange transfer to a
      center with neonatal intensive care facilities. Both of these have been shown to 
      reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity. Until recently, none of the currently
      used tocolytics, whether licensed or unlicensed, were developed specifically for 
      the inhibition of preterm labor and consequently, they exhibit various
      potentially serious side-effects. As a result of the recent licensing of the
      oxytocin antagonist, atosiban, developed for the treatment of preterm labor and
      due to its high utero-specificity, obstetricians have experienced an advance in
      their options for the management of spontaneous preterm labor.

TI  - Effects of isosorbide mononitrate and AII inhibition on pulse wave reflection in 
      hypertension.
PG  - 297-301
AB  - The aortic pulse wave contour in isolated systolic hypertension often shows a
      prominent reflection peak, which combines with the incident wave arising from
      cardiac ejection so as to widen pulse pressure. We investigated the effects of an
      extended-release nitrate preparation and of 2 angiotensin II (AII) inhibitors (an
      AII receptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor) on the aortic pulse wave contour
      and systemic blood pressure in hypertensive subjects with high augmentation index
      caused by exaggerated pulse wave reflection. Two double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled crossover studies were carried out in a total of 16 elderly
      patients with systolic hypertension resistant to conventional antihypertensive
      therapy. In 1 study, pharmacodynamic responses to single doses of placebo,
      isosorbide mononitrate, eprosartan, and captopril were determined; in the other, 
      single-dose isosorbide mononitrate and placebo were compared in subjects treated 
      with AII inhibitors at baseline. Blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometry 
      and pulse wave components by applanation tonometry at the radial artery. All 3
      agents were shown to decrease brachial systolic blood pressure, aortic systolic
      blood pressure, and aortic pulse pressure. Qualitative effects on the aortic
      pulse wave contour differed: augmentation index was not significantly altered by 
      either captopril or eprosartan but was decreased (P<0.0001) by approximately 50% 
      of the placebo value with isosorbide mononitrate in both study groups. We propose
      that isosorbide mononitrate corrected the magnified wave reflection in systolic
      hypertension of these elderly patients by an effect that was distinct from that
      exercised by either acute or chronic AII inhibition.

TI  - Antipsychotics and QT prolongation.
PG  - 85-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate literature relating to cardiac QT prolongation and the use
      of antipsychotic drugs. METHOD: Literature searches of EMBASE, Medline, PsychLIT 
      were performed in December 2001 and reference sections of retrieved papers
      scrutinized for further relevant reports. RESULTS: The Cardiac QTc interval is
      difficult to measure precisely or accurately but appears to be a useful predictor
      of risk of dysrhythmia (specifically torsade de pointes) and sudden death. It is 
      less clear that drug-induced QTc prolongation gives rise to similar risks but
      data are emerging, linking antipsychotic use to increased cardiac mortality. Many
      antipsychotics have been clearly associated with QTc prolongation. Methodological
      considerations arguably preclude assuming that any antipsychotic is free of the
      risk of QTc prolongation and dysrhythmia. CONCLUSION: Available data do not allow
      assessment of relative or absolute risk of dysrhythmia or sudden death engendered
      by antipsychotics but caution is advised. Risk of dysrhythmia can very probably
      be reduced by careful prescribing of antipsychotics in low doses in simple drug
      regimens which avoid metabolic interactions. Electrocardiographic monitoring may 
      also help to reduce risk but review by specialist cardiologist may be necessary.

TI  - Treatment of sporadic hemiplegic migraine with calcium-channel blocker verapamil.
PG  - 120-1
AB  - Gene mutations within the P/Q type neuronal calcium channel in familial
      hemiplegic migraine (FHM) suggest a therapeutic role for calcium-channel
      blockade. The authors have previously reported abortive therapy of FHM with IV
      verapamil. Here the authors describe four cases of sporadic hemiplegic migraine
      (SHM) responsive to verapamil, administered either orally or IV. The findings
      indicate that verapamil is effective therapy for both SHM and FHM.

TI  - The angiotensin-receptor blockers: from antihypertensives to cardiovascular
      all-round medications in 10 years?
PG  - 328-38
AB  - Angiotensin-receptor blockers have been part of the antihypertensive treatment
      armamentarium since the mid-1990s. During this period, the number of agents has
      increased greatly, as has the number of indications for which these drugs are
      being tested in randomized controlled clinical trials. Beginning as efficacious
      and very well tolerated antihypertensives, angiotensin-receptor blockers have
      been shown to have benefits in patients with diabetes and heart failure that are 
      not only attributable to the reduced blood pressure, as supported by recently
      concluded trials. The expanding treatment areas with these agents widen the
      interest in their applicability across the entire cardiovascular continuum. A
      number of large-scale studies set to report within the next few years will
      further determine the effects of angiotensin-receptor blockers in a range of
      cardiovascular indications beyond hypertension.

TI  - Doxazosin, but not amlodipine decreases insulin resistance in patients with
      chronic renal failure: a prospective, randomized-controlled study.
PG  - 405-10
AB  - Insulin resistance (IR) in chronic renal failure (CRF) is well-known. In this
      randomized-controlled study, we aimed to compare the effect of doxazosin and
      amlodipine on IR in patients with CRF. Fifteen patients with CRF (male/female:
      5/10, mean age: 46 +/- 13 years) and 9 controls (male/female: 3/6, mean age: 35
      +/- 8 years) were included. Patients and controls had no family history of
      diabetes mellitus. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was calculated as a marker
      of IR. Patients were grouped randomly to doxazosin (n = 8; 2-4 mg/day) and
      amlodipine (n = 7; 5-10 mg/day) arms. Baseline biochemical analysis (fasting
      serum glucose, BUN, creatinine, uric acid, cholesterol and cholesterol subgroups)
      and parameters related with insulin metabolism (insulin, C peptide, HOMA) were
      similar between amlodipine and doxazosin groups. There was no difference in age, 
      gender and body mass index among study groups. The follow-up time was 12 weeks.
      Patients with CRF had higher HOMA (1.83 +/- 0.55 vs 1.00 +/- 0.36, p = 0.001),
      fasting insulin (8.06 +/- 1.98 vs 4.46 +/- 1.31 IU/l, p < 0.001) and serum
      triglyceride levels (197 +/- 136 vs 112 +/- 67 mg/dl, p = 0.04) as compared to
      controls. Serum HDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in patients with 
      CRF than controls (40 +/- 10 vs 57 +/- 14 mg/dl, p = 0.02). HOMA significantly
      decreased after doxazosin (1.91 +/- 0.45 vs 1.41 +/- 0.21, p = 0.02), however, no
      difference was found after amlodipine. Also, fasting insulin levels were
      decreased after a 12-week doxazosin therapy from 8.17 +/- 1.22 vs 6.58 +/- 0.84
      IU/l, p = 0.02), but no change was seen after amlodipine. Lipid parameters did
      not significantly change during the study period in 2 groups. No adverse effect
      requiring drug discontinuation was observed during the 12-week period in the
      study groups. In conclusion, doxazosin decreases IR in patients with CRF, whereas
      amlodipine has no effect. This may be of advantage in the treatment of
      hypertension in this group of patients for preventing some long-term complication
      of IR.

TI  - The use of sildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction in relation to
      diabetes mellitus--a study of 1,511 patients.
PG  - 387-90
AB  - Erectile dysfunction (ED) seriously impairs the quality of life. Patients with
      diabetes mellitus (DM) are prone to ED due to various factors, including
      vasculopathy, neuropathy and sex hormone abnormalities. This is a retrospective
      study involving 1,511 patients taking sildenafil. Patients with DM have
      significantly more comorbidities like hypertension and ischaemic heart disease.
      They are also more likely to be on medications which may affect erectile
      function, including various antihypertensive drugs. 77.9% of patients with DM
      reported success with sildenafil, as compared to 86.5% of patients without DM. A 
      significant number of patients with DM require a higher dose of sildenafil as
      compared to those without DM.

TI  - Citalopram-induced severe hyponatraemia with coma and seizure. Case report with
      literature and spontaneous reports review.
PG  - 179-87
AB  - Numerous case reports of hyponatraemia followed increasing use of selective
      serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) but this adverse effect was only rarely
      observed in relation to citalopram. We report a case of severe hyponatraemia
      associated with deep coma, seizure, atrial fibrillation and muscle damage in a
      92-year-old woman after only two doses of citalopram, and review 14 cases
      previously published in the literature and 28 cases spontaneously reported to
      Australian Drug Reaction Advisory Committee (ADRAC). The data presented suggest
      that citalopram, as well as SSRIs may cause hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome
      of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). The majority of
      symptomatic cases occurred in elderly patients (79% were older than 70 years) and
      in women (74%). Polymedication and concomitant use of another psychotropic drug
      or thiazide diuretic may precipitate and/or augment the development of
      hyponatraemia/SIADH. In 84% of cases, the hyponatraemia associated with
      citalopram was detected during the first month of treatment. High level of
      suspicion, close and careful monitoring of serum sodium concentration
      particularly in elderly patients and especially in the first month of therapy
      with citalopram may reduce the incidence of this serious and likely not rare
      adverse effect.

TI  - Effect of intracoronary nicorandil administration on preventing no-reflow/slow
      flow phenomenon during rotational atherectomy.
PG  - 1119-23
AB  - A major limitation of the rotational atherectomy (RA) procedure is the occurrence
      of the no-reflow/slow flow phenomenon and the optimal strategy is still evolving.
      Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of nicorandil,
      an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel opener, on no-reflow 
      in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the effect of nicorandil on no-reflow/slow flow phenomenon during RA
      procedures. Sixty-one patients who underwent RA of complex coronary lesions were 
      randomly divided into 2 groups: (i) nicorandil cocktail (n=24 patients, 37
      lesions) and (ii) verapamil cocktail (n=37 patients, 63 lesions). In each group, 
      the drug cocktail mixed with pressurized saline was infused through the 4Fr
      Teflon sheath of the rotablator system during the RA procedure. In the nicorandil
      group, the drug cocktail consisted of 24 mg of nicorandil, 5 mg of nitroglycerin,
      and 10,000 U of heparin. In the verapamil group, the drug cocktail consisted of
      10 mg of verapamil, 5 mg of nitroglycerin, and 10,000 U of heparin. Baseline and 
      procedure characteristics did not differ between the 2 groups. RA was performed
      successfully, and death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or emergency coronary
      artery bypass surgery did not occur in any patients. The no-reflow/slow flow
      phenomenon was observed in 11/63 (17.4%) lesions of the verapamil group, but in
      only 1/37 (2.7%) lesions of the nicorandil group (p=0.03). No untoward
      complications were observed during nicorandil infusion. These data indicate that 
      the intracoronary continuous infusion of nicorandil during RA procedures is easy 
      and safe, and prevents no-reflow/slow flow phenomenon more effectively than
      infusion of verapamil.

AB  - Interest in envenoming syndromes caused by Australian jellyfish has been intense 
      since the deaths in early 2002 of two tourists in Queensland, attributed to the
      Irukandji syndrome. We review current knowledge of these envenoming syndromes,
      mechanisms of venom action and therapy, focusing on the deadly box jellyfish,
      Chironex fleckeri, and the array of jellyfish thought to cause the Irukandji
      syndrome. Current understanding of jellyfish venom activity is very limited, and 
      many treatments are unproven and based on anecdote.

TI  - A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with atrial
      fibrillation.
PG  - 1825-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are two approaches to the treatment of atrial fibrillation: one
      is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus
      rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial
      fibrillation to persist. In both approaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is
      recommended. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these 
      two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of 
      stroke or death. The primary end point was overall mortality. RESULTS: A total of
      4060 patients (mean [+/-SD] age, 69.7+/-9.0 years) were enrolled in the study;
      70.8 percent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery 
      disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged 
      in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent.
      There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and
      310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years,
      23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent
      confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control 
      group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more
      adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the
      majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the
      international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic. CONCLUSIONS: Management of
      atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advantage
      over the rate-control strategy, and there are potential advantages, such as a
      lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy.
      Anticoagulation should be continued in this group of high-risk patients.

TI  - Investigation of the effect of FK506 (tacrolimus) and cyclosporin on gingival
      overgrowth following paediatric liver transplantation.
PG  - 398-403
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gingival overgrowth associated with immunosuppression following
      liver transplantation is a commonly recognized clinical problem. The aims of this
      study were to determine the incidence of gingival overgrowth in a group of
      children post liver transplantation and to compare gingival overgrowth in
      children receiving FK506 with those receiving cyclosporin. METHODS: Seventy-nine 
      children (aged 15-196 months) undergoing liver transplantation at Birmingham
      Children's Hospital between October 1998 and October 2000 were studied. Gingival 
      overgrowth was assessed in a blinded fashion and scored in a previously validated
      manner. Gingival overgrowth scores of the patients on each immunosuppressant drug
      were then compared. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were treated with cyclosporin and
      27 treated with tacrolimus. Eighteen children were also receiving nifedipine
      (also known to cause gingival overgrowth) and were considered separately. Of the 
      41 children receiving cyclosporin alone, 26 exhibited gingival overgrowth
      compared to zero of 20 patients receiving tacrolimus alone. Those children
      treated with immunosuppression plus nifedipine developed gingival overgrowth,
      however, this was much less marked in the tacrolimus group. CONCLUSION:
      Tacrolimus, unlike cyclosporin, is not associated with gingival overgrowth when
      used for immunosuppression following liver transplantation in children, and may
      be the drug of choice for children.

TI  - Myocardial ischaemia in patients with impaired left ventricular function
      undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting--milrinone versus nifedipin.
PG  - 796-802
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Myocardial ischaemia and infarction are major
      complications immediately after coronary artery bypass grafting. They may be due 
      to incomplete surgical revascularization, perioperative anaesthetic management or
      vasospasm of arterial grafts, e.g. the internal mammary artery. Infusions of
      nifedipine or milrinone have been advocated to prevent spasm of the mammary
      artery. The study compared the incidence of myocardial ischaemia after continuous
      infusion of either nifedipine (0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) or milrinone (0.375
      microg kg(-1) min(-1)) in patients with compromised left ventricular function
      scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft. METHODS: After Institutional
      Review Board approval, this double-blinded randomized clinical study enrolled 30 
      adult patients with compromised left ventricular function (ejection fraction <
      0.4) scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting after written
      informed consent had been obtained. Ischaemia was detected by Holter
      electrocardiographic monitoring. The incidence of myocardial cell death was
      monitored by serial determinations of the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and
      troponin-I. RESULTS: New ST elevation > or = 0.2 mV or new ST depression < or =
      0.1 mV occurred in five of 15 patients in the milrinone group (33.3%) and in 13
      of 15 patients (86.6%) in the nifedipine group (P < 0.05). There were increases
      in CK-MB and troponin-I in both groups. Twenty-four hours postoperatively, CK-MB 
      (P = 0.003) and troponin-I (P = 0.001) were significantly higher in the
      nifedipine group. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative continuous infusion of milrinone,
      compared with nifedipine, results in a significantly lower incidence of
      myocardial ischaemia and myocardial cell damage after elective coronary artery
      bypass grafting.

AB  - A new method for preclinical evaluation of safety of antiarrhythmic drugs is
      proposed. During chronic stress, class I antiarrhythmic preparations increased
      mortality of test animals. By contrast, class II-IV antiarrhythmic agents and
      antioxidants produced no significant effect on mortality of experimental mice.
      These data agree with published results of multicenter studies.

TI  - New therapeutic and surgical approaches for sporadic and hereditary
      pheochromocytoma.
PG  - 41-53
AB  - Pheochromocytoma is a rare, surgically correctable cause of hypertension. Modern 
      medical blockade has significantly improved patient survival and morbidity. The
      last decade has seen the identification of the genes responsible for several
      hereditary causes of pheochromocytoma. Evaluation of these patients has
      demonstrated different catecholamine profiles associated with the different
      syndromes. Genetic testing and new, more sensitive catecholamine tests are
      allowing better, earlier diagnosis of affected patients. Some patients with small
      tumors deemed nonfunctional by traditional methods may be safely observed until
      function is demonstrated. Laparoscopic surgery has supplanted the use of open
      surgery in the management of these tumors. Adrenocortical-sparing surgery may be 
      performed using laparoscopy in patients with hereditary forms of
      pheochromocytoma.

TI  - Antiplatelet activity of semotiadil fumarate.
PG  - 187-90
AB  - Calcium antagonists are known to exert antiplatelet activity. Semotiadil fumarate
      (SD-3211), a new benzothiazine, was therefore examined for its antiplatelet
      activity. The inhibitory activity on adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-, collagen-,
      arachidonic acid (AA)-, and platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced platelet
      aggregation after the 1-, 30-, 60- and 120-min incubation at concentrations
      ranging from 1 x 10(-3), 1 x 10(-4), 1 x 10(-5), 1 x 10(-6) and 1 x 10(-7) was
      examined. The data were compared with those using diltiazem, nifedipine and
      amlodipine under identical conditions in blood from eight healthy volunteers
      (four males, four females; aged 23-36 years) and eight hypertensive patients
      (four males, four females; aged 31-46 years). Semotiadil showed a dose-dependent 
      inhibition of platelet aggregation in vitro with all the agents examined. Using
      the various aggregation-inducing agents, the dose-dependent inhibitory action was
      comparable for all the compounds tested. The antiaggregatory potency was in the
      order diltiazem, semotiadil, amlodipine and nifedipine. The incubation period did
      not significantly affect the antiaggregatory effect. No difference between
      platelets derived from healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients was noted.
      These findings indicate potent antiplatelet activity of the new calcium
      antagonist semotiadil.

TI  - Migraine: preventive treatment.
PG  - 491-512
AB  - Migraine is a common episodic headache disorder. A comprehensive headache
      treatment plan includes acute attack treatment to relieve pain and impairment and
      long-term preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration. 
      Circumstances that might warrant preventive treatment include: (i) migraine that 
      significantly interferes with the patient's daily routine despite acute
      treatment; (ii) failure, contraindication to, or troublesome side-effects from
      acute medications; (iii) overuse of acute medications; (iv) special
      circumstances, such as hemiplegic migraine; (v) very frequent headaches (more
      than two a week); or (vi) patient preference. Start the drug at a low dose. Give 
      each treatment an adequate trial. Avoid interfering, overused, and
      contraindicated drugs. Re-evaluate therapy. Be sure that a woman of childbearing 
      potential is aware of any potential risks. Involve patients in their care to
      maximize compliance. Consider co-morbidity. Choose a drug based on its proven
      efficacy, the patient's preferences and headache profile, the drug's
      side-effects, and the presence or absence of coexisting or co-morbid disease.
      Drugs that have documented high efficacy and mild to moderate adverse events
      (AEs) include beta-blockers, amitriptyline, and divalproex. Drugs that have lower
      documented efficacy and mild to moderate AEs include selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel antagonists, gabapentin, topiramate,
      riboflavin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

      hypertension, require treatment with a short-acting antihypertensive in order to 
      quickly achieve blood pressure (BP) control. We administered isradipine, a
      short-acting, second-generation calcium antagonist, to 72 such children.
      Retrospective data collection was undertaken to determine the effects of
      isradipine treatment. The mean age of children treated with isradipine was
      74+/-55 months (mean+/-SD). Nearly all of these children had secondary
      hypertension and were initially treated as hospital inpatients for newly
      diagnosed hypertension. Mean isradipine dose was 0.36+/-0.17 mg/kg per day, with 
      no significant variation in dose according to patient age. Isradipine was
      administered three times per day in most instances, but 21% of the time it was
      administered four times per day. An extemporaneous isradipine suspension was used
      in 62% of treatment courses. BP control was achieved with isradipine alone in 38 
      children; the remainder received isradipine in combination with additional
      antihypertensives. Comparison of pre-treatment BP with BP obtained 8+/-9 days
      later demonstrated a significant BP reduction with isradipine treatment, with a
      mean reduction of 14+/-13 mmHg for systolic BP and 13+/-15 mmHg for diastolic BP.
      There was no effect of isradipine treatment on heart rate. Adverse effects
      occurred in 9.5% of treatment courses, and included headache, flushing,
      dizziness, and tachycardia. We conclude that isradipine successfully lowers BP in
      hypertensive children with secondary forms of hypertension. Use of isradipine
      suspension allows infants and young children to be treated as readily as older
      children.

TI  - Utility of computed tomographic renal angiogram in the management of childhood
      hypertension.
PG  - 741-7
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of computed tomography (CT)
      renal angiogram (CTRA) in the management of childhood hypertension. This is a
      retrospective study of 24 children with clinical suspicion of renovascular
      disease who underwent CTRA examinations. CTRA demonstrated surgically correctable
      etiology of hypertension in 38% of the patients [5 with renal artery stenosis
      (RAS) and 4 with renal pathology]. In 5 patients, CTRA findings of RAS were
      confirmed by catheter angiogram. CTRA missed RAS in 1 patient in whom catheter
      angiogram showed beaded narrowing of the renal artery. All 6 patients with RAS
      had resolution of hypertension immediately after angioplasty or surgery. One
      patient with diffuse renal artery stenosis had an ipsilateral multicystic
      dysplastic kidney. In this patient hypertension resolved spontaneously as the
      dysplastic kidney shrunk in size. Seven patients had a renal etiology for
      hypertension. In 3 of these patients hypertension resolved after nephrectomy.
      Malignant hypertension in the 4th patient with reflux nephropathy was controlled 
      medically after she underwent bilateral ureteral reimplantation. The remaining 3 
      patients with renal etiology were managed medically. We found that the etiology
      was central for hypertension in 4 patients with brain abnormalities, obesity in 1
      overweight patient, essential hypertension in 4 patients, and thoracic aorta
      coarctation in 1 patient. Our study showed that in all except 1 instance CTRA
      could diagnose a surgically correctable cause for hypertension. CTRA provided
      useful information for the management of pediatric hypertension in all our
      patients.

TI  - Primary pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale.
PG  - 265-78
AB  - Primary pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale represent forms of precapillary 
      pulmonary hypertension due to intrinsic lung disease. In the case of primary
      pulmonary hypertension, this is due to disease of the pulmonary vasculature while
      cor pulmonale is related to diseases of the pulmonary vasculature, airways, or
      interstitium. Patients present with signs and symptoms of right ventricular
      dysfunction and low cardiac output including dyspnea, chest pain and peripheral
      edema. Therapy is directed at the underlying disease and may include supplemental
      oxygen for diseases causing chronic hypoxemia and anticoagulation for thrombotic 
      disease. Vasodilator therapy has variable efficacy for pulmonary vascular
      disorders. Postacyclin by continuous infusion has been a major advance in the
      therapy of primary pulmonary hypertension and has prolonged survival and delayed 
      the need for lung transplantation. Bosentan, an endothelin receptor blocking
      agent is the first oral medication approved for the therapy of pulmonary
      hypertension.

TI  - Diltiazem heals glyceryl trinitrate-resistant chronic anal fissures: a
      prospective study.
PG  - 1091-5
AB  - PURPOSE: Both topical diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, and glyceryl
      trinitrate, a nitric oxide donor, lower anal pressure and heal two-thirds of
      chronic anal fissures. This study evaluated the efficacy of diltiazem for
      fissures that failed to heal with glyceryl trinitrate. METHODS: Consecutive
      patients with persistent chronic fissures despite treatment with 0.2 percent
      glyceryl trinitrate ointment underwent anal manometry before and for 1 hour after
      application of 700 mg of 2 percent diltiazem gel to the distal anal canal.
      Patients applied diltiazem twice daily for eight weeks or until the fissure had
      healed. At fortnightly review, fissure healing was assessed, and side effects
      were noted. Patients scored symptoms of pain, bleeding, and irritation using
      linear visual analog scales at the initial and follow-up visits. RESULTS: In 39
      patients (13 males; median age, 42 (range, 20- 80) years), topical 2 percent
      diltiazem gel lowered anal resting pressure by 20 percent from a median of 93 to 
      74 cm H2O (P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon), and fissures healed in 19 (49 percent) within 8
      weeks. Before diltiazem, 27 patients (69 percent) had used a complete course of
      glyceryl trinitrate (0.5 g twice daily for 8 weeks), and 12 (44 percent) of these
      healed with diltiazem. The remaining 12 patients had discontinued glyceryl
      trinitrate prematurely or used less because of headaches; 7 (58 percent) of these
      healed with diltiazem, and 5 (42 percent) did not. Side effects occurred in four 
      patients (10 percent): three reported perianal itching but continued with
      treatment, and one developed headaches, drowsiness, and mood swings six weeks
      into treatment and stopped diltiazem at that time. CONCLUSION: Topical 2 percent 
      diltiazem is effective treatment for glyceryl trinitrate-resistant chronic anal
      fissures. Side effects, mainly perianal itching, may occur in 10 percent of
      patients but are generally tolerated.

TI  - Nicardipine hydrochloride injectable phase IV open-label clinical trial: study on
      the anti-hypertensive effect and safety of nicardipine for acute aortic
      dissection.
PG  - 337-45
AB  - We performed a multicentre, phase IV, open-label clinical trial to examine the
      clinical usefulness of a continuous infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride to
      control hypertension in 31 patients with acute aortic dissection. Target blood
      pressure levels were reached within 15 min in 16 patients; in 15-30 min in 10
      patients; in 30-45 min in three patients; and in 45-60 min in two patients.
      Baseline average systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures were 147
      +/- 23 mmHg, 82 +/- 18 mmHg and 104 +/- 18 mmHg, respectively, with third-day
      pressures significantly reduced at 119 +/- 12 mmHg, 69 +/- 9 mmHg and 86 +/- 8
      mmHg. Blood pressures after discontinuation of the infusion were not
      significantly different from those measured on the third day of infusion and no
      definite adverse effects attributable to the treatment were observed. Nicardipine
      hydrochloride was both effective and safe at controlling blood pressure in
      patients with acute aortic dissection.

TI  - Admissions caused by adverse drug events to internal medicine and emergency
      departments in hospitals: a longitudinal population-based study.
PG  - 285-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate incidence rates of drug-related hospitalizations (DRHs) in
      a longitudinal population-based study with prospective event assessment. DESIGN: 
      Cohort study and time-trend analysis. SETTING: All departments of internal
      medicine and emergency departments in the urban regions of Jena and Rostock,
      Germany, serving about 520,000 residents. PARTICIPANTS: All patients admitted
      between October 1997 and March 2000. Patients with severe cutaneous reactions
      were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of DRH was defined by symptoms or
      diagnoses at admission that were very likely, likely, or possibly caused by
      prescription medications, according to a standardized assessment. RESULTS: The
      incidence of DRH was 9.4 admissions per 10,000 treated patients [95% confidence
      interval (CI) 9.0-9.9]. Rates were highest for antithrombotics with 26.9
      admissions per 10,000 treated patients (95% CI 23.6, 30.1). Most frequent events 
      were gastroduodenal lesions and bleeding (45%). Digitalis preparations showed a
      linearly increasing trend from 2/10,000 to 14/10,000 during ten quarters (
      P<0.0001), which was exclusively attributable to digitoxin, the major source of
      digitalis in the study area (93%). The incidence of DRH increased with age
      (4/10,000 to 20/10,000). The mean length of stays in patients with DRH was
      13+/-10.6 days. Cumulative direct costs for hospitalization were Euro 4 million
      in the two urban study areas. The annual direct costs for Germany were estimated 
      to be Euro 400 million. CONCLUSIONS: DRHs are a considerable public health and
      economic burden. A longitudinal design can observe changes in population-based
      incidence over time. This approach can be used for public-health planning or to
      evaluate outcomes of quality management programs designed to reduce drug-induced 
      illness.

TI  - Experience with intraplaque injection of verapamil for Peyronie's disease.
PG  - 621-5; discussion 625-6
AB  - PURPOSE: We examined the use of intraplaque injection of verapamil for the
      treatment of Peyronie's disease through its effects on pain, curvature,
      indentation, sexual function and erectile capacity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      total of 156 men underwent treatment with intraplaque verapamil injection.
      Patients were assessed objectively, during dynamic penile duplex ultrasound, as
      well as subjectively using a questionnaire before and after initiation of the
      treatment protocol. Patients were also stratified by duration of disease before
      therapy and into 1 of 3 Kelami classification groups based on pretreatment plaque
      size and severity of curvature. Differences before and after treatment and among 
      the Kelami classification groups were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 140 patients who 
      completed treatment 73 (60%) had an objectively measured decrease in curvature
      while 79 (62%) reported a subjective decrease in curvature during the followup
      interview. After treatment 111 (83%) men reported an increase in girth, 107 (80%)
      an increase in rigidity distal to the plaque and 92 (71%) an improvement in
      sexual function. Among each Kelami class curvature was objectively measured to
      decrease in 41%, 68% and 62% of patients in classes I, II and III, respectively. 
      There was no significant difference in response based on duration of disease (60%
      improvement versus 61% improvement for disease duration of less or greater than 1
      year in duration, respectively). Mean followup was 30.4 months (range 10 to 81)
      and there was no reported recurrence of penile deformity in those men with an
      initial posttreatment positive response. CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil injection of
      Peyronie's plaques appears to be a clinically effective treatment option for pain
      and curvature and can contribute to subjective improvement in sexual function and
      erectile capacity. The low incidence of complications indicates that this therapy
      is also clinically safe.

TI  - Topical lidocaine does not limit autonomic dysreflexia during anorectal
      procedures in spinal cord injury: a prospective, double-blind study.
PG  - 104-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Autonomic dysreflexia is a common and potentially dangerous 
      response in patients with spinal cord injury at T6 or above. Acute blood pressure
      elevation may be precipitated by rectosigmoid distention and anal manipulation.
      Topical anesthetics are widely recommended to minimize the incidence and severity
      of autonomic dysreflexia, although no scientific evidence supports or refutes
      this practice. This study tested whether topical lidocaine would prevent or limit
      anorectal procedure-associated autonomic dysreflexia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We
      enrolled patients with chronic, complete spinal cord injury scheduled for
      anoscopy and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy. In a double-blind fashion they were
      randomized to receive either 2% lidocaine jelly (n = 18) or nonmedicated
      lubricant (control; n = 32) just prior to the procedure. We measured blood
      pressure before, during, and after procedures. RESULTS: Mean maximal systolic
      blood pressure increased 35 +/- 25 mmHg in the lidocaine group vs. 45 +/- 30 mmHg
      in the control group (NS). However, there was a significant difference between
      anoscopic procedures and flexible sigmoidoscopies without anoscopy (49 +/- 29 vs.
      25 +/- 20 mmHg). CONCLUSION: Topical lidocaine did not significantly limit or
      prevent autonomic dysreflexia in susceptible patients. Both anoscopy and flexible
      sigmoidoscopy caused significant blood pressure elevation. Anoscopy, which
      involves stretching of the anal sphincters, was a more potent stimulus for
      autonomic dysreflexia than flexible sigmoidoscopy, which involves gaseous
      distention of the rectosigmoid. Anal sphincter stretch and rectosigmoid
      distention, rather than a mucosal stimulus, are likely nociceptive triggers for
      procedure-associated autonomic dysreflexia.

TI  - Class benefits of AT(1) antagonists in Type 2 diabetes with nephropathy.
PG  - 625-8
AB  - Diabetes mellitus has reached epidemic proportions in many countries and is the
      most common cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD). The angiotensin II
      receptor-1 (AT(1)) antagonists losartan and irbesartan have recently been
      evaluated as renoprotective agents in large clinical trials of patients with Type
      2 diabetes and nephropathy. In the Reduction of End points in
      Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist
      (RENAAL) study, losartan decreased the number of patients reaching the primary
      end point of a composite of measures of neuropathy. The relative risk reduction
      was approximately 15% with losartan and this was due to a reduction in both the
      doubling of creatinine concentration (25%) and of ESRD (28%) but not in death. In
      the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT), the beneficial effect of
      irbesartan was mainly against the doubling of the baseline creatinine
      concentration (37% risk reduction) but there was also a 20% reduction in the
      onset of ESRD. Irbesartan had no effect on mortality. Beneficial effects occurred
      in addition to blood pressure being controlled by agents other than the AT(1)
      antagonists. These clinical trials suggest that there may be a class
      renoprotective action with AT(1) antagonists, although the mechanism is not
      clear. Patients with Type 2 diabetes and nephropathy should receive either an
      AT(1) antagonist or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril to
      ensure renoprotection.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial assessing the side-effects of glyceryl trinitrate and
      diltiazem hydrochloride in the treatment of chronic anal fissure.
PG  - 413-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) ointment (0 small middle dot2 per cent)
      has an efficacy of up to 68 per cent in healing chronic anal fissure, but with
      headache as a major side-effect. Diltiazem hydrochloride (DTZ) cream (2 per cent)
      is expected to have fewer side-effects. METHODS: A prospective double-blind
      randomized two-centre trial requiring at least 26 patients in each group (alpha =
      0.05, beta = 0.9) was instituted after approval of the local ethics committee, to
      compare the incidence of side-effects (primary endpoint) with 0.2 per cent GTN
      ointment and 2 per cent DTZ cream in the treatment of chronic anal fissure.
      Treatments were applied perianally, twice daily for 6-8 weeks. All patients gave 
      written informed consent. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable in patient
      demographics and clinical characteristics. Twelve patients violated the protocol,
      withdrew or did not attend follow-up. There were more side-effects with GTN (21
      of 29 patients) than with DTZ (13 of 31) (relative risk (RR) 1.84 (95 per cent
      confidence interval (c.i.) 1.11 to 3.04), P = 0.01). In particular, more
      headaches occurred with GTN (17 of 29 patients) than with DTZ (eight of 31) (RR
      2.06 (95 per cent c.i. 1.18 to 3.59), P = 0.01). There were no significant
      differences in healing and symptomatic improvement rates between patients
      receiving GTN (25 of 29) and DTZ (24 of 31). DISCUSSION: DTZ cream caused
      substantially fewer headaches than GTN ointment. There was no significant
      difference in the healing or improvement of chronic anal fissure between the
      treatments. DTZ may be the preferred first-line treatment for chronic anal
      fissure.

TI  - Nifedipine or hydralazine as a first-line agent to control hypertension in severe
      preeclampsia.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is one of the most serious and common complications of 
      pregnancy. Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, and the vasodilator hydralazine
      have both been used as antihypertensive agents in this condition. The aim of this
      study was to determine which of these two agents is the most appropriate
      antihypertensive in the management of severe pre-eclampsia. METHODS: One hundred 
      and twenty-six pre-eclamptic patients with a gestational age of more than 20
      weeks were randomized to receive either 8 mg nifedipine sublingually or 5-10 mg
      intravenous hydralazine. Women with a history of heart failure and women
      receiving antihypertensive treatment during the course of the current pregnancy
      were excluded. For each patient the following data were recorded; the number of
      drug administrations, the time needed to control blood pressure, mean urinary
      output, the time interval between effective control and a new hypertensive crisis
      after each drug administration and relevant adverse effects in mother or fetus.
      RESULTS: Effective control of blood pressure was achieved in both treatment arms.
      Data analysis indicated significantly fewer drug administrations in the
      nifedipine arm of the study. The time interval before a new hypertensive crisis
      following initial effective control of blood pressure was significantly longer in
      the nifedipine group when compared with hydralazine. Effective control of blood
      pressure was achieved more rapidly in multiparous patients receiving nifedipine
      (p=0.026). Mean urinary output before and after delivery was greater in the
      nifedipine arm of the study. There were no significant differences between the
      two groups in other variables. In addition, in neither group were there any
      serious adverse effects in mother or fetus. CONCLUSION: Nifedipine is safe and
      more effective than hydralazine in controlling blood pressure in severe
      pre-eclampsia. It has the added advantage of being cheaper and more widely
      available than the latter and is easily administered.

TI  - Dipyridamole may be used safely in patients with ischaemic heart disease.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - It is thought that up to 50% of patients with cerebrovascular disease will have
      concurrent ischaemic heart disease. Dipyridamole co-formulated with aspirin has
      been shown to increase the relative reduction in risk of second stroke in
      patients with prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack beyond that obtaining with 
      aspirin alone. We have sought to resolve the question of whether dipyridamole
      treatment increases the risk of cardiac adverse events in patients with
      co-existing ischaemic heart disease. The published literature, periodic safety
      update reports, the randomised controlled trials of antiplatelet agents in stroke
      prevention and those including dipyridamole in cardiovascular indications, have
      been reviewed and analysed. The early reports of serious adverse cardiac effect
      attributable to dipyridamole occurred in patients with severe coronary artery
      disease using dipyridamole as a stress test adjunct to cardiac imaging. The
      randomised controlled trials databases show no evidence of mortality and only
      isolated cases of significant cardiac morbidity attributable to dipyridamole at
      recommended oral doses in patients with ischaemic heart disease. We conclude that
      patients with cerebrovascular and mild to moderate concomitant ischaemic heart
      disease may be treated safely with dipyridamole for the secondary prevention of
      stroke.

TI  - Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, losartan, causes regression of left
      ventricular hypertrophy in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 256-61
AB  - Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) commonly occurs in patients with end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD) and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events.
      Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) antagonists may be able to reverse LVH
      independent to the hypotensive effect in the ESRD setting. Thirty chronically
      hemodialyzed uremic patients with hypertension were randomly assigned to receive 
      the AT1-R antagonist losartan (n = 10), the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACD)
      inhibitor enalapril (n = 10), or calcium antagonist amlodipine (n = 10). Left
      ventricular mass (LVM) index was measured by echocardiography before and 6 months
      after treatment. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics did not
      differ between the three groups. The mean baseline LVM index also did not differ 
      in the three groups. After 6 months of treatment, losartan treatment
      significantly reduced the LVM index (-24.7 +/- 3.2%) than amlodipine (-10.5 +/-
      5.2%) or enalapril (-11.2 +/- 4.1%) therapy. All three groups had a similar
      decrease in the mean blood pressure with treatment. The plasma angiotensin II
      concentration increased 5-fold with losartan treatment. In contrast, the plasma
      angiotension II concentration did not change with enalapril and only increased
      2-fold with amlodipine. Thus, the present study indicates that losartan more
      effectively regresses LVH in patients with ESRD than do enalapril and amlodipine 
      despite a comparable depressor effect between the three drugs.

TI  - Evaluation of the safety of short-acting nifedipine in children with
      hypertension.
PG  - 35-40
AB  - Concerns regarding the safety of nifedipine emerged in 1995 with the report of an
      increased risk of myocardial infarction associated with adult patients receiving 
      short-acting calcium channel blockers. There have been few case reports of
      adverse events in children. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      effect on blood pressure (BP) and the incidence of adverse events associated with
      nifedipine in our pediatric population. We conducted a retrospective chart review
      of pediatric patients who received nifedipine. We recorded the dose administered,
      all BP measurements and all adverse events reported within six hours of a
      nifedipine dose regardless of the likelihood that those events were related to
      the nifedipine dose. 1,746 doses of nifedipine in 166 pediatric patients were
      reviewed. Systolic BP decreased by a mean of 17% and a maximum of 63%. Diastolic 
      BP decreased by a mean of 28% and a maximum of 89%. Adverse events included: a)
      change in neurologic status, six cases; b) hypotension, two cases; c) oxygen
      desaturation, 16 cases. Neurologic events occurred in 33% of patients with acute 
      CNS injury and 3.6% of all patients. Short-acting nifedipine is an important and 
      effective oral antihypertensive agent which can be safely used for the treatment 
      of hypertensive emergencies in children. It should be used with caution in
      children with acute CNS injury.

TI  - Statin-associated myopathy.
PG  - 486-9
AB  - Myopathy occurs in 0.1%-0.2% of patients receiving statins in clinical trials.
      This adverse effect is shared by all statins, but is more common with
      cerivastatin, especially in combination with gemfibrozil. The risk of myopathy is
      increased by: the use of high doses of statins, concurrent use of fibrates,
      concurrent use of hepatic cytochrome P450 inhibitors, acute viral infections,
      major trauma, surgery, hypothyroidism and other conditions. Statin-associated
      myopathy should be suspected when a statin-treated patient complains of
      unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. Statin therapy should be stopped
      in cases of suspected myopathy, and serum creatine kinase levels should be
      checked and monitored. No specific therapies other than statin withdrawal and
      supportive measures for rhabdomyolysis are currently available.

TI  - Efficacy of nifedipine or lisinopril in the treatment of hypertension after renal
      transplantation: a double-blind randomised comparative trial.
PG  - 426-31
AB  - Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors are
      commonly used in the treatment of hypertensive renal transplant recipients. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate if the response rate to treatment
      differs with these drugs in this setting. A single centre, prospective,
      randomised, double-blinded, comparative study to address the efficacy of
      controlled release nifedipine or lisinopril in the treatment of hypertension
      (diastolic blood pressure > or =95 mmHg) in cyclosporin (CsA)-treated renal
      transplant recipients was performed. Recipients were randomised to receive either
      lisinopril (10 mg once daily) or controlled release nifedipine (30 mg once
      daily). The dose was doubled on indication. The number of responders (diastolic
      blood pressure <90 mmHg on monotherapy) were addressed during the early
      post-transplant phase (first 3 months) and during a late post-transplant phase
      (from 3 to 12 months after renal transplantation) in the same patient population.
      One hundred and fifty-four patients (nifedipine=78, lisinopril=76) with untreated
      hypertension (diastolic blood pressure> or =95 mmHg) were randomised within 3 wk 
      after renal transplantation. One hundred and twenty-three patients
      (nifedipine=69, lisinopril=54) completed the study. Fourteen (20%)
      nifedipine-treated recipients responded during the early, and 26 (38%) during the
      late post-operative phase (months 4-12 after renal transplantation). Eleven (20%)
      lisinopril-treated recipients responded during the early, and 18 (33%) during the
      late post-transplant phase. Non-responders were, on average, 8.5+/-1.5 kg heavier
      both in the early phase and after 1 yr of treatment (p<0.01), and 6.1+/-0.9 yr
      older than responders (p<0.05). In conclusion, these results indicate that both
      controlled release nifedipine and lisinopril are equally efficient in the
      treatment of post-transplant hypertension. As monotherapy, both drugs show a
      "response rate" of 20-38%, depending on time interval after transplantation.

TI  - Beneficial effects of diltiazem during myocardial reperfusion: a randomized trial
      in acute myocardial infarction.
PG  - 757-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although in experimental models of coronary occlusion diltiazem
      administration has been shown to reduce the degree of stunning and of reperfusion
      injury, the majority of clinical trials has failed to demonstrate significant
      benefits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of diltiazem,
      administered before coronary reperfusion, on infarct size, residual myocardial
      viability and recovery of left ventricular function. METHODS: We studied 90
      patients admitted within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial
      infarction. They were immediately randomized to either intravenous diltiazem (10 
      mg bolus + 10 mg/hour for 3 days) (group 1, n = 43) or placebo (group 2, n = 47) 
      and subsequently treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. All 
      underwent serial echocardiograms upon admission, 4 days post-admission during
      low-dose dobutamine stress echo, at discharge and after 6 months. We calculated
      the dysfunction score (1 = hypokinesia, 2 = akinesia, 3 = dyskinesia) on
      admission and its percent reduction after dobutamine (viability) and at follow-up
      (recovery). The 12-lead electrocardiograms were continuously monitored for 3 days
      and coronary angioplasty was performed whenever the residual stenosis was > 60%. 
      RESULTS: Upon admission, there were no differences in age, sex, infarct location 
      and size, degree of ST-segment elevation, time from onset of symptoms and
      dysfunction score. Creatine kinase peaked early in 70% of patients in both
      groups; the incidences of recurrent ischemia, infarct-related vessel patency and 
      the need for coronary angioplasty were also similar. The creatine kinase peak was
      significantly higher in group 2 (2931 +/- 2456 vs 1726 +/- 1004 IU/l, p < 0.05). 
      Conversely, in group 1 the residual viability was significantly higher (51 +/- 23
      vs 36 +/- 30% improvement in dysfunction score, p < 0.05) and the early recovery 
      of regional function was significantly greater (35 +/- 34 vs 18 +/- 22% at
      discharge, p < 0.05). On the other hand, the delayed recovery was not
      significantly different (15 +/- 29 vs 21 +/- 32% from the time of discharge to 6 
      months of follow-up). CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous diltiazem, started before coronary
      reperfusion, has beneficial effects on the infarct size, residual viability and
      recovery of regional function. If confirmed by larger trials, these preliminary
      results suggest the use of diltiazem as adjunctive therapy in patients with acute
      myocardial infarction and undergoing reperfusion.

TI  - Adverse and beneficial effects of tocolytic therapy.
PG  - 316-40
AB  - In addition to questions raised about the efficacy of many tocolytics,
      appropriate concern has been voiced about the safety of these potent drugs.
      Although some degree of risk for adverse effects with drugs promising a strong
      therapeutic effect can be accepted, caution needs to be exercised when benefits
      are marginal or unproven. Unfortunately, some of the tocolytics, most notably the
      betamimetics and magnesium sulfate, have been found to have considerable
      potential for adverse maternal cardiovascular and respiratory effects. Although
      less clearly established, the use of indomethacin appears to be associated with
      increased fetal and neonatal risks. Concerning magnesium sulfate, in addition to 
      the well-known maternal effects, the accumulating evidence showing an increased
      frequency of adverse outcomes in the fetus and neonate has led to the
      recommendations to abandon its use entirely as a tocolytic. Given the limitations
      of our current state of knowledge, nifedipine would appear to be among the more
      efficacious and safer tocolytics available to use when properly indicated.

TI  - Postdischarge adverse drug reactions in primary care originating from hospital
      care in France: a nationwide prospective study.
PG  - 781-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe and estimate the incidence and preventability of
      postdischarge adverse drug reactions (ADRs) detected in primary care in France.
      DESIGN: Prospective study of patients referred to hospital by participating
      general practitioners (GPs). These GPs reported all cases of an adverse reaction 
      to a drug instituted in hospital among patients who consulted them within 30 days
      of discharge. SETTING: 305 general practices from all French regions. PATIENTS:
      7540 patients referred by GPs to private or public hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: The incidence for postdischarge ADRs in primary care, and their
      preventability. RESULTS: 30 cases of postdischarge ADR were detected in 29
      re-consulting patients, yielding a minimal incidence for France of 0.4 per 100
      admissions (95% confidence interval 0.3 to 0.6). The ADRs were assessed as
      serious in 60% of cases. The main drug classes implicated were cardiovascular
      drugs (8 ADRs), oral anticoagulants (6), psychoactive drugs (4), antidiabetics
      (3), and opioid analgesics (3). Patients experiencing a postdischarge ADR were
      older than patients not experiencing one (median age: 77 vs 68 years; p = 0.004).
      Detected ADRs were considered preventable in 59% of cases. CONCLUSIONS:
      Physicians and patients should be aware of the possible occurrence of
      postdischarge ADRs. Patient information in hospital, close postdischarge
      follow-up of patients at risk, and appropriate transmission of information
      between hospital physicians and GPs can help to prevent them.

TI  - Effects of long-term cyclic iloprost therapy in systemic sclerosis with Raynaud's
      phenomenon. A randomized, controlled study.
PG  - 503-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Iloprost is a stable prostacyclin analogue which has been shown to be 
      effective in the short-term symptomatic treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP)
      secondary to systemic sclerosis (SSc). The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      effects of long-term cyclic therapy with iloprost in comparison with nifedipine
      on the skin score, pulmonary function and Raynaud's severity score in patients
      with SSc and RP. METHODS: We conducted a 12-month prospective, randomised,
      parallel-group, blind-observer trial to compare the effects of intravenously
      infused iloprost (2 ng/kg/min on 5 consecutive days over a period of 8 hours/day 
      and subsequently for 8 hours on one day every 6 weeks) with those of conventional
      vasodilating therapy with nifedipine (40 mg/day for os) in 46 patients with SSc
      and RP. RESULTS: At 12 months, iloprost but not nifedipine reduced the skin score
      (iloprost: from 13.26 +/- 2.05 to 9.26 +/- 1.32, p = 0.002; nifedipine: from
      10.83 +/- 2.09 to 12.17 +/- 3.02, p = n.s.; iloprost vs nifedipine: p = 0.016)
      and the RP severity score (iloprost: from 2.17 +/- 0.2 to 1.22 +/- 0.13, p = 0.02
      vs baseline; nifedipine: from 2.08 +/- 0.34 to 1.33 +/- 0.22, p = n.s.). Carbon
      monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), expressed as % of the predicted normal value,
      worsened significantly in the nifedipine group (from 69.6 +/- 7.4% to 61.5 +/-
      6.5%, p = 0.044) and remained stable in patients treated with iloprost (from 53.2
      +/- 4.8 to 56.0 +/- 4.6%, iloprost vs nifedipine: p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: In SSc 
      patients, cyclic intravenous iloprost infusion is able to control vasospastic
      disease. Our results suggest that it might also act as a disease-modifying agent,
      as it seems to improve the course of the disease. Further studies principally
      focused on organ involvement and the natural history of the disease are needed to
      confirm our results.

TI  - Pharmacological management of detrusor instability.
PG  - 271-8
AB  - Urinary incontinence and lower urinary tract dysfunction remain an important
      cause of morbidity, affecting at least 14% of women over the age of 30 years.
      Whilst the etiology and pathophysiology of detrusor instability remains to be
      elucidated drug therapy remains important in the management of women with the
      irritative symptoms of urgency, frequency and urge incontinence. The number of
      drugs which have been developed illustrates the point that none are ideal, often 
      having systemic adverse effects limiting their therapeutic usage and affecting
      compliance. This review aims to assess the current pharmacological management of 
      detrusor instability as well as examining recent progress in the development of
      new agents, some of which may prove to be efficacious.

TI  - Renoprotective effect of the angiotensin-receptor antagonist irbesartan in
      patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 851-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether either the angiotensin-II-receptor blocker
      irbesartan or the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine slows the progression of
      nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes independently of its capacity to
      lower the systemic blood pressure. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1715
      hypertensive patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes to treatment with
      irbesartan (300 mg daily), amlodipine (10 mg daily), or placebo. The target blood
      pressure was 135/85 mm Hg or less in all groups. We compared the groups with
      regard to the time to the primary composite end point of a doubling of the
      base-line serum creatinine concentration, the development of end-stage renal
      disease, or death from any cause. We also compared them with regard to the time
      to a secondary, cardiovascular composite end point. RESULTS: The mean duration of
      follow-up was 2.6 years. Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a risk of 
      the primary composite end point that was 20 percent lower than that in the
      placebo group (P=0.02) and 23 percent lower than that in the amlodipine group
      (P=0.006). The risk of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration was 33
      percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.003) and 37 
      percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the amlodipine group (P<0.001).
      Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a relative risk of end-stage renal 
      disease that was 23 percent lower than that in both other groups (P=0.07 for both
      comparisons). These differences were not explained by differences in the blood
      pressures that were achieved. The serum creatinine concentration increased 24
      percent more slowly in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.008)
      and 21 percent more slowly than in the amlodipine group (P=0.02). There were no
      significant differences in the rates of death from any cause or in the
      cardiovascular composite end point. CONCLUSIONS: The angiotensin-II-receptor
      blocker irbesartan is effective in protecting against the progression of
      nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes. This protection is independent of the
      reduction in blood pressure it causes.

TI  - A systematic approach to the management of preterm labor.
PG  - 223-35
AB  - Preterm birth occurs in 7% to 12% of all deliveries, but accounts for over 85% of
      all perinatal morbidity and mortality. Although the ability of obstetric care
      providers to identify women at risk for preterm delivery has improved, the
      overall incidence of preterm birth has remained unchanged for the past 30 years. 
      Preterm birth remains the single greatest challenge for physician-researchers in 
      the field of maternal-fetal medicine in the 21st century. This article reviews in
      detail the current state of the literature as regards the etiology,
      pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of premature labor and preterm birth. 
      A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the process of
      labor, both at term and preterm, will improve our ability to identify and manage 
      women at risk of premature delivery.

TI  - Adverse drug reaction monitoring--digitoxin overdosage in the elderly.
PG  - 336-43
AB  - Drug-related illness is an everlasting universal problem and also an important
      cause of admissions to hospitals. Adverse reactions are still grossly
      underreported by medical professions. Little information is available regarding
      the frequency or type of ADRs managed in hospitals. Since January 1997, we have
      taken part in a study, supported by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and
      Medical Device to improve the spontaneous drug information reporting system in
      Germany. Three German regionalized Departments of Clinical Pharmacology--Jena,
      Dresden, Rostock--serve as Pharmacovigilance Centers in collaboration with the
      Pharmacoepidemiology Research Group of the University of Munich. Since January
      1997, the regional group in Jena has been monitoring the University Clinic of
      Internal Medicine for admissions caused by adverse drug reactions. All emergency 
      cases and patients on intensive care units were checked for adverse drug
      reactions. We present our results, including clinical and demographic data,
      concerning intoxications and especially those involving digitoxin in 210 patients
      with ADR. Forty patients with digitoxin toxicity had an average age of 81 years
      (81.1+/-6.3), a low body weight (59.7+/-12.7 kg) and 3 out of 4 were women. 75%
      of all patients with digitoxin side effects had elevated serum digitoxin levels
      with concentrations higher than 25 microg/ml. The relatively high frequency of
      digitoxin intoxications in our hospital may reflect the advanced age and low body
      weight of patients. Patients received digitoxin regardless of age, weight and,
      sometimes, clinical indication. Physicians should be aware of drugs having a high
      risk when used in elderly patients. The use of digitoxin assays and keeping serum
      levels within or near the therapeutic range will diminish the incidence of
      overdoses.

TI  - Chronic hypertension in pregnancy.
PG  - 447-63
AB  - Pregnant women with chronic hypertension are at risk for maternal and perinatal
      morbidity. Careful assessment and management of these patients during pregnancy
      are the keys to reducing maternal and fetal complications. Antihypertensive
      treatment should be used in women with high-risk chronic hypertension, whereas
      drug therapy does not improve pregnancy outcome in women at low risk.
      Prophylactic low-dose aspirin started early in pregnancy in women with chronic
      hypertension is not effective in reducing the frequency of superimposed
      preeclampsia and should be avoided.

TI  - Reduction of left ventricular mass by lisinopril and nifedipine in hypertensive
      renal transplant recipients: a prospective randomized double-blind study.
PG  - 107-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the dominant cause of death in renal
      transplant recipients. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a known risk factor.
      After renal transplantation, persistent hypertension is an important determinant 
      for the further evolution of LVH. The aim of the present study was to compare the
      effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril) with a
      calcium channel blocker (CCB) (controlled release nifedipine) in treatment of
      posttransplant hypertension focusing on changes in LVH. METHODS: One hundred
      fifty-four renal transplant recipients presenting with hypertension (diastolic
      BP> or =95 mmHg) during the first 3 weeks after transplantation were randomized
      to receive double-blind 30 mg nifedipine or 10 mg lisinopril once daily. RESULTS:
      One hundred twenty-three patients completed 1 year of treatment. Good quality
      echocardiographic data were available in 116 recipients (62 nifedipine/54
      lisinopril) 2 and 12 months posttransplant. Blood pressure was equally well
      controlled in the two groups throughout the study (mean systolic/diastolic+/-SD
      after 1 year: 140+/-16/87+/-8 mmHg with nifedipine and 136+/-17/85+/-8 mmHg with 
      lisinopril). Left ventricular mass index was reduced by 15% (P<0.001) in both
      groups (from 153+/-43 to 131+/-38 g/m2 with nifedipine and from 142+/-35 to
      121+/-34 g/m2 with lisinopril). There were no statistically significant
      differences between the two treatment groups at baseline or at follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: In hypertensive renal transplant recipients with well-controlled
      blood pressure, there is a regression of left ventricular mass after renal
      transplantation. The regression of left ventricular mass index is observed to a
      similar extent in patients treated with lisinopril or nifedipine.

TI  - Antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine in children with chronic kidney diseases.
PG  - 387-91
AB  - In adults the calcium antagonist amlodipine given once a day has proved to be an 
      attractive addition to the antihypertensive armamentarium. The present report
      describes our experience in 43 paediatric outpatients (26 boys and 17 girls, aged
      between 1.1 and 19, median 9.8 years) with chronic kidney diseases. The patients 
      were given amlodipine for 16 weeks as part of their antihypertensive treatment.
      Before amlodipine arterial pressure was 150 (142-163)/90 (84-95) mm Hg (median
      and interquartile range). Six patients withdrew from amlodipine because of
      oedema, flushing or headache. In the remaining patients amlodipine 7.7 (6.9-9.4) 
      mg/m(2) body surface area once a day significantly decreased arterial pressure by
      17 (13-22)/10 (7-13) mm Hg. The efficacy of amlodipine was more pronounced in
      girls than in boys. No changes in heart rate, body weight and circulating
      haemoglobin, sodium, potassium and creatinine were noted. In none of the patients
      circulating potassium, sodium or creatinine changed by more than 0.5 mmol/l, 5
      mmol/l respectively 20%. In 11 patients concomitantly treated with cyclosporine
      the dosage and the trough-level of this agent were stable throughout the trial.
      In conclusion the present experience in paediatric outpatients with chronic
      kidney diseases supports the view that amlodipine is an effective and rather well
      tolerated antihypertensive drug when given once a day.

TI  - Contemporary management of chronic stable angina.
PG  - 109-21
AB  - Chronic stable angina is a common condition with a prognosis that is less benign 
      than is generally appreciated. The optimal treatment strategy of this disorder is
      unclear, and few anti-ischaemic agents have been rigorously tested in
      prospectively randomised mortality studies. The evidence base for the
      anti-ischaemic therapy of chronic angina draws upon data 'borrowed' from studies 
      in acute coronary syndromes, and from studies in chronic angina using surrogate
      endpoints such as ambulatory silent ischaemia. Such evidence leads us to believe 
      that anti-ischaemic therapy with beta-blockers offers a mortality benefit in
      chronic angina. In contrast, the mortality benefit of lipid lowering therapy and 
      antiplatelet agents is well proven. Angioplasty offers no mortality benefit in
      the treatment of chronic angina, although it is more effective than medical
      therapy alone for the relief of symptoms. In a few patients with high order
      proximal coronary disease, coronary bypass surgery offers a distinct mortality
      advantage compared with medical treatment alone. Most patients, however, do not
      warrant such an approach, and only require surgery for when they remain
      symptomatic despite adequate medical therapy. Alternative strategies such as
      cardiac transplantation, transmyocardial laser revascularisation and spinal cord 
      stimulation are now accepted in a subgroup of patients for the treatment of
      chronic angina refractory to standard therapy.

TI  - Pharmacologic therapy of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
PG  - 67-79
AB  - Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a potentially
      life-threatening condition characterized by a failure of pulmonary vascular
      resistance to decrease adequately during the transition to extrauterine life.
      Inhaled nitric oxide, a vasodilator that acts selectively on the pulmonary
      circulation, has revolutionized the treatment of this condition. However, inhaled
      nitric oxide has not proven effective in all patients, particularly those with
      congenital diaphragmatic hernias or meconium aspiration syndrome. Furthermore,
      large clinical trials of inhaled nitric oxide have failed to demonstrate
      significant differences in mortality between nitric oxide-treated and control
      infants with PPHN. Other therapeutic approaches to PPHN have been limited by a
      relative lack of specificity for the pulmonary circulation, and have received
      much less attention. Pharmacologic approaches, including pulmonary surfactants,
      prostacyclin, endothelin antagonists, Ca(2+)-channel blockers, magnesium sulfate,
      and tolazoline, have exhibited varying degrees of efficacy in lowering pulmonary 
      vascular pressures in humans and/or animals. A number of these agents are also
      effective when used in combination. For example, phosphodiesterase inhibitors
      have been reported to act synergistically with inhaled nitric oxide. Surfactants 
      also appear to be useful in PPHN, particularly in patients with congenital
      diaphragmatic hernia, when used in combination with other therapies. Surfactant
      lavage and other novel therapies may also be effective in combination therapy of 
      meconium aspiration syndrome. Further studies should be directed at defining the 
      optimal therapies in specific clinical settings. Validation of multiple
      therapeutic modalities for PPHN, including inhaled nitric oxide, will allow for
      rational, combined vasodilator strategies that are specific for the underlying
      pathophysiology in each patient.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients treated with
      oral diltiazem and limited intensive care management.
PG  - 138-46; discussion 146-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients are frequently
      treated with prophylactic nimodipine and undergo invasive monitoring of blood
      pressure and volume status in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting to decrease
      the incidence of delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) and improve
      functional outcomes. The goal of this study was to examine the incidence of DIND 
      and poor functional outcomes in a consecutive series of SAH patients treated with
      a different regimen of prophylactic oral diltiazem and limited use of intensive
      care monitoring. METHODS: The study involved a consecutive series of 123
      aneurysmal SAH patients treated by the senior author who were admitted within 72 
      hours of hemorrhage and who never received nimodipine or nicardipine. Functional 
      outcomes were graded using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). RESULTS: Of the 123
      patients identified, favorable outcomes (GOS 4 and 5) were achieved in 74.8%. The
      incidence of DIND was 19.5%. Hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilutional (HHH)
      therapy was used in 10 patients (8.1%) and no patients were treated for DIND by
      endovascular means. Seven patients (5.7%) had a poor functional outcome or death 
      because of DIND and two of these were related to complications of HHH therapy.
      These results were compared to contemporary series of SAH patients managed with
      other treatment protocols. CONCLUSIONS: Functional outcomes of patients treated
      with a regimen of oral diltiazem, limited use of ICU monitoring and HHH therapy
      for DIND compare favorably with other contemporary series of SAH patients.

TI  - Topical diltiazem ointment in the treatment of chronic anal fissure.
PG  - 553-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic anal fissure has traditionally been treated surgically.
      Initial enthusiasm for chemical sphincterotomy has waned because of poor outcomes
      with glyceryl trinitrate ointment. In this study the use of topical 2 per cent
      diltiazem ointment has been investigated as an alternative method of chemical
      sphincterotomy. METHODS: A prospective assessment of 71 consecutive patients with
      a chronic anal fissure treated with 2 per cent topical diltiazem ointment for a
      median duration of 9 (range 2--16) weeks was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-one
      patients (75 per cent) experienced healing of the fissure after 2--3 months of
      treatment with topical diltiazem. Seventeen patients who did not heal were
      treated for a further 8 weeks with topical diltiazem. Eight of these patients
      subsequently healed with diltiazem. Fifty-nine of 67 patients who completed
      follow-up therefore healed on diltiazem ointment. Four patients experienced
      perianal dermatitis and one patient experienced headaches. No other side-effects 
      were recorded. After a median of 32 (range 14--67) weeks' follow-up following
      completion of treatment, 27 of 41 patients available remain symptom free. Six of 
      seven patients with recurrent fissure were treated successfully by repeat
      chemical sphincterotomy. CONCLUSION: Topical 2 per cent diltiazem ointment used
      as an agent for chemical sphincterotomy for chronic anal fissure offers
      significant healing rates but does not have a significant side-effect profile,
      which may aid compliance to treatment. Early recurrences are common but usually
      amenable to further chemical sphincterotomy.

TI  - Hypothesis: Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and weight gain: A systematic
      analysis.
PG  - 250-4
AB  - One of the arguments put forward against the primary use of beta-blockers has
      been concern about adverse metabolic effects, such as unfavorable effects on
      lipids or insulin sensitivity. Another less-appreciated potential drawback is
      their propensity to cause weight gain in some patients. In 8 evaluable
      prospective randomized controlled trials that lasted >/=6 months, body weight was
      higher in the beta-blocker than in the control group at the end of the study. The
      median difference in body weight was 1.2 kg (range -0.4 to 3.5 kg). A regression 
      analysis suggested that beta-blockers were associated with an initial weight gain
      during the first few months. Thereafter, no further weight gain compared with
      controls was apparent. There was no relationship between demographic
      characteristics and changes in body weight. Based on these observations, the
      first-line use of beta-blockers in obese hypertensive patients should be
      reviewed. Obesity management in overweight hypertensive patients may be more
      difficult in the face of beta-blocker treatment.

TI  - Comparative effects of mibefradil and nifedipine gastrointestinal transport
      system on autonomic function in patients with mild to moderate essential
      hypertension.
PG  - 279-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: L-type dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been
      implicated in increased cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension,
      perhaps due to adverse effects on autonomic nervous system (ANS) function.
      Blockade of T-type calcium channels may limit ANS dysfunction by inhibition of T 
      channel-mediated neuroendocrine effects. OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: This double-blind,
      parallel group study compared the effect of nifedipine gastrointestinal transport
      system (GITS) (L-type CCB) versus mibefradil (T-type CCB) on ANS function in
      patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension. METHODS: Sixteen patients (10
      male, 6 female; age 57.2 +/- 2.3 years), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 95 mmHg
      were randomized to nifedipine 30 mg daily or mibefradil 50 mg daily (2 weeks),
      then nifedipine 60 mg daily or mibefradil 100 mg daily (4 weeks). Sympathetic
      nervous system activity (SNSA) was assessed using norepinephrine kinetics.
      Parasympathetic nervous system activity (PSNA) was assessed from 24 h Holter
      recordings of heart rate variability (HRV). Non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity
      (BRS) provided integrated assessment of ANS. RESULTS: Patient groups were well
      matched at baseline. Achieved DBP was lower in patients treated with mibefradil
      compared with nifedipine, (83.4 +/- 1.7 versus 95.25 +/- 3.3 mmHg). There were no
      significant differences in SNSA and BRS between groups, however the root mean
      square of successive differences and high frequency power (HFP) were increased in
      mibefradil compared with nifedipine-treated patients [(+ 1.07 +/- 1.6 versus
      -3.36 +/- 1.2 ms, P < 0.05) and (+ 0.28 +/- 0.1 versus -0.23 +/- 0.1 ms2, P <
      0.01), respectively]. Furthermore, Ln HFP/Ln total power was increased from week 
      0 to week 6 in the mibefradil-treated group, (0.71 +/- 0.02 versus 0.74 +/- 0.03,
      P = 0.046). CONCLUSION: No differences existed between effect of L- and T-type
      CCBs on SNSA and BRS. However, T-type CCBs increased PSNA, independent of
      achieved changes in heart rate.

TI  - Importance of rate control or rate regulation for improving exercise capacity and
      quality of life in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and normal left
      ventricular function: a randomised controlled study.
PG  - 171-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the importance of rhythm regulation or rate control in
      patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) and normal left ventricular
      function. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Thirty six patients with a mixed fast and
      slow ventricular response rate to their AF were randomised to either His bundle
      ablation (HBA) and VVIR pacemaker (HBA group) or VVI pacemaker and
      atrioventricular modifying drugs (Med group). Outcomes assessed at one, three,
      six, and 12 months included exercise duration and quality of life. RESULTS:
      Exercise duration significantly improved from baseline in both groups. There was 
      no difference in outcome between the groups (Med +40% v HBA +20%, p = NS). The
      heart rate profile on exercise was similarly slowed in both groups compared to
      baseline. Quality of life significantly improved in both treatment arms for the
      modified Karolinska questionnaire (KQ) (Med +50% v HBA +50%, p = NS) and the
      Nottingham health profile (NHP) (Med +40% v HBA +20%, p = NS). However, for the
      individual symptom scores of each questionnaire more were improved in the Med
      group (KQ-Med 6 improved v HBA 4, NHP-Med 3 v HBA 1). Left ventricular function
      was equally preserved by both treatments during follow up. CONCLUSION: In these
      patients control of ventricular response rate with either HBA + VVIR pacemaker or
      atrioventricular modifying drugs + VVI pacemaker will lead to a significant
      improvement in exercise duration and quality of life. Rhythm regulation by HBA
      did not confer additional benefit, suggesting rate control alone is necessary for
      the successful symptomatic treatment of these patients in permanent AF.

TI  - Effects of long-term treatment with verapamil on left ventricular function and
      myocardial blood flow in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy without overt heart
      failure.
PG  - 744-50
AB  - Myocardial blood flow (MBF) abnormalities are present in early stage dilated
      cardiomyopathy (DCM) and have been attributed to coronary microvascular
      abnormalities. The favorable effects of verapamil on coronary microcirculation
      might indicate its use in early stage DCM. We assessed the safety of long-term
      combination therapy of verapamil and enalapril and its effects on both left
      ventricular function and myocardial perfusion compared with enalapril alone in 18
      patients with DCM (15 men, 3 women; mean age, 50+/-9 years) without overt heart
      failure (NYHA class I-II). At baseline and after 6 months of randomized treatment
      with either enalapril (10-20 mg) (nine patients, group 1) or enalapril (10-20 mg)
      and verapamil (120-240 mg) (nine patients, group 2), left ventricular function
      was assessed at rest, during handgrip, and during bicycle exercise by equilibrium
      radionuclide angiography. Mean MBF was measured at rest and after dipyridamole by
      positron emission tomography (PET) and 13N-ammonia as a flow tracer. At baseline,
      the two groups had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at rest, which was 
      further impaired during isometric exercise, but increased at peak bicycle
      exercise. MBF was similarly reduced in the two groups at rest and during
      dipyridamole. During treatment, no adverse events occurred in either group. After
      6 months there was no significant difference in the main study variables either
      between the two groups or within each group before and after treatment. Long-term
      combination therapy with verapamil and enalapril is safe in patients with DCM
      without overt heart failure. Despite no favorable effect on myocardial perfusion,
      combined treatment prevented deterioration of left ventricular function,
      similarly to enalapril alone.

TI  - Effects of a slow-release nifedipine on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and
      ischemic changes on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in patients with severe 
      coronary artery disease.
PG  - 36-43
AB  - Calcium antagonists have long been used as first-line drugs for hypertension and 
      angina. However, deleterious effects have also been reported in patients treated 
      with calcium antagonists. Thus, we evaluated the effect of a slow-release
      twice-daily formulation of nifedipine in 10 patients with severe coronary artery 
      disease. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) and blood
      pressure monitoring (ABPM) were performed simultaneously to detect any
      association between ischemic episodes on the ECG and changes in blood pressure
      (BP) and heart rate with and without nifedipine. Increased oxygen demand due to
      an increased systolic BP and heart rate was associated with ischemic episodes
      without nifedipine, while those with nifedipine were accompanied by a fall in
      diastolic BP and a rapid increase in heart rate. This slow-release twice-daily
      formulation of nifedipine may induce myocardial ischemia through a heart-rate
      increase and a decrease in coronary blood flow due to lower diastolic BP in
      patients with severe coronary artery disease. A once-daily formulation of
      nifedipine might be of great value for such patients.

TI  - [Effectiveness of felodipine in hypertensive patients with mild cerebral
      cognition disorders in a randomized double-blind study].
PG  - 1350-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment occurs more frequently in
      hypertensives than in normotensive individuals. Early signs of cognitive
      impairment are predictors of dementia in late life. Felodipine is capable of
      almost normalizing plasma viscosity, which is elevated in most of hypertensive
      patients, thus improving microcirculation. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      whether this hemorheologic property of felodipine in addition to its blood
      pressure lowering effect can improve cognitive performance in hypertensive
      patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Randomized, double-blind comparison between
      felodipine 10 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg amiloride 5 mg (HCT/amiloride) in 
      patients 50-70 years of age with impaired cognitive function (c.l. test 1-2
      points) and with resting blood pressure values of diastolic > 95 and < or = 115
      mmHg and/or systolic > 160 and < or = 210 mmHg. Blood pressure measurements and
      evaluation of total short term storage capacity were done at the beginning and
      after 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: 31 patients (14 felodipine and 17
      HCT/amiloride) were included in the per protocol analysis. Blood pressure values 
      at the beginning and after 12 weeks of treatment were (mmHg): for felodipine
      systolic 168 +/- 4 and 150 +/- 6 (p < 0.01), diastolic 108 +/- 3 and 88 +/- 4 (p 
      < 0.001). For amiloride/HCT systolic 173 +/- 8 and 150 +/- 10 (p < 0.01),
      diastolic 105 +/- 5 and 88 +/- 5 (p < 0.001). Short term storage capacity
      improved by 15 +/- 6 bits during felodipine treatment (p < 0.001) and by 9 +/- 9 
      bits during amiloride/HCT treatment (p < 0.05). Thus cognitive improvement was
      superior by 67% in the felodipine group compared to amiloride/HCT (p < 0.05).
      CONCLUSION: In this study a pronounced improvement of mental performance occurred
      in patients treated with felodipine. Since the cognitive gain was significantly
      superior to amiloride/HCT treatment there must be an additional blood
      pressure-independent effect of felodipine, such as enhancing microcirculation.
      Whether these properties possibly counteract the development of dementia in
      hypertensives has to be evaluated in long term studies in more patients.

TI  - Rate-control versus conversion strategy in postoperative atrial fibrillation: a
      prospective, randomized pilot study.
PG  - 871-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation remains a frequent complication after heart
      surgery. The optimal strategy to treat the condition has not been established.
      Several retrospective studies have suggested that a primary rate-control strategy
      may be equivalent to a strategy that restores sinus rhythm. METHODS: Fifty
      patients with atrial fibrillation after heart surgery were randomly assigned to a
      strategy of antiarrhythmic therapy with or without electrical cardioversion or
      ventricular rate control. Both arms received anticoagulation with heparin
      overlapped with warfarin. The primary end point was time to conversion to sinus
      rhythm analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Atrial fibrillation relapse after the
      initial conversion was monitored in the hospital over a 2-month period. RESULTS: 
      There was no significant difference between an antiarrhythmic conversion strategy
      (n = 27) and a rate-control strategy (n = 23) in time to conversion to sinus
      rhythm (11.2 +/- 3. 2 vs 11.8 +/- 3.9 hours; P =.8). With the use of Cox
      multivariate analysis to control for the effects of age, sex, beta-blocker usage,
      and type of surgery, the antiarrhythmic strategy showed a trend toward reducing
      the time from treatment to restoration of sinus rhythm (P =.08). The length of
      hospital stay was reduced in the antiarrhythmic arm compared with the
      rate-control strategy (9.0 +/- 0.7 vs 13.2 +/- 2.0 days; P =.05). In-hospital
      relapse rates in the antiarrhythmic arm were 30% compared with 57% in the
      rate-control strategy (P =.24). There were no significant difference in relapse
      rates at 1 week (24% vs 28%), 4 weeks (6% vs 12%), and 6 to 8 weeks (4% vs 9%).
      At the end of the study, 91% of the patients in the rate-control arm were in
      sinus rhythm compared with 96% in the antiarrhythmic arm (P =.6). CONCLUSIONS:
      This pilot study shows little difference between a rate-control strategy and a
      strategy to restore sinus rhythm. Regardless of strategy, most patients will be
      in sinus rhythm after 2 months. A larger randomized, controlled study is needed
      to assess the impact of restoration of sinus rhythm on length of stay.

TI  - Management of mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy: a review.
PG  - 849-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of evidence relating to management of
      mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy, including associated risks, benefits,
      and harms of treatment with antihypertensive agents, nonpharmacologic measures,
      and aspirin and benefits of various monitoring strategies. DATA SOURCES: Using
      four broad search strategies, we searched English and non-English-language
      citations in 16 electronic databases from their inception to February 1999 and
      consulted relevant textbooks, references, and experts. STUDY SELECTION: Reviewers
      screened 6228 abstracts and found 215 articles that met multiple prespecified
      patient selection, study population, and design criteria. TABULATION,
      INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Forty-six studies consistently showed that chronic
      hypertension triples the risk for perinatal mortality (odds ratio [OR] 3.4; 95%
      confidence interval [CI] 3.0, 3.7) and doubles the risk for placental abruption
      (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1, 3.9). Thirteen small, randomized controlled trials had
      inadequate power to rule in or rule out moderate-to-large (20%-50%) benefits of
      antihypertensive treatment. Possible adverse effects were fetal renal failure
      when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are used in the second or third
      trimester and growth restriction when atenolol is used early in pregnancy. Trials
      showed that aspirin neither reduces nor increases perinatal and maternal
      morbidity, but they did not rule out possible small-to moderate beneficial or
      adverse effects. No studies provide guidance on benefits or consequences of
      various nonpharmacologic therapies or monitoring strategies. CONCLUSION: Mild
      chronic hypertension is associated with increased maternal and fetal risks.
      Beneficial treatment and monitoring regimens are not clear, but some treatments, 
      such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are best avoided.

TI  - Effect of indomethacin on blood pressure in elderly people with essential
      hypertension well controlled on amlodipine or enalapril.
PG  - 1161-7
AB  - Arthritis and hypertension are frequent comorbidities in the elderly hypertensive
      population. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to relieve pain
      in arthritic patients but a side effect is sodium retention and consequent
      elevation of blood pressure (BP). The effect of dihydropyridine calcium blocking 
      drugs is relatively independent of sodium intake, whereas the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors' effects can be blunted by a
      high-sodium diet. This study compared the effects of indomethacin with placebo in
      elderly patients with essential hypertension who had been controlled with
      amlodipine or enalapril. Indomethacin 50 mg twice daily or placebo was
      administered for 3 weeks in a double-blind crossover study to patients controlled
      with amlodipine or enalapril. The response was assessed by ambulatory BP
      measurement. Indomethacin raised BP and lowered pulse rates in patients taking
      enalapril but had little effect in patients receiving amlodipine. The difference 
      caused by indomethacin between the two groups was 10.1/4.9 mm Hg increase in BP
      and a 5.6 beats/min fall in pulse in people taking enalapril. Addition of
      indomethacin to patients taking either drug caused a rise in weight and a fall in
      plasma renin. It is postulated that the effect is due to inhibition of
      prostaglandin synthesis, which causes sodium retention. In patients taking
      amlodipine, the fall in plasma renin ameliorates the effect of sodium retention
      on BP. In patients taking enalapril, plasma renin falls but this is not
      translated into an effect because of the blockage of converting enzyme. Thus, the
      full effect of sodium retention on BP is expressed. In patients treated with
      indomethacin, fewer patients may respond to ACE inhibitors. However, the major
      problem is the patient who intermittently takes indomethacin or other
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which, if a person is treated by an ACE
      inhibitor causes BP to go out of control. In such patients amlodipine would
      appear to be a preferred choice to enalapril.

TI  - Haemodynamic and metabolic effects of rilmenidine in hypertensive patients with
      metabolic syndrome X. A double-blind parallel study versus amlodipine.
PG  - 1515-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of rilmenidine with those of amlodipine on
      blood pressure, glucose metabolism, plasma lipid concentration and fibrinolysis
      parameters. DESIGN: A four-month randomized double-blind, parallel group study.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Obese hypertensive patients with hypertriglyceridaemia (>
      or = 2.3 mmol/l) and impaired glucose tolerance (OMS-ADA) were included (n = 52).
      A placebo run-in period of 2 weeks was followed by 4 months of double-blind
      treatment with either rilmenidine or amlodipine. Blood pressure was recorded
      using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Glucose metabolism was evaluated by an oral
      glucose tolerance test RESULTS: Of the 52 patients recruited, 47 (21 rilmenidine 
      and 26 amlodipine) completed the 4-month treatment period. The intention-to-treat
      analysis showed a comparable reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure
      (SBP, DBP) with the two anti-hypertensive treatments (rilmenidine -13.9/-13.5
      mmHg; amlodipine - 17.6/-15.0 mmHg). Insulin concentrations under basal
      conditions and 2 h after a standard oral glucose load did not change
      significantly after treatment in both groups. Plasma glucose under basal
      conditions and 2 h after a standard oral glucose load as well as the area under
      the plasma glucose concentration curve tended to decrease in the rilmenidine
      group and to increase in the amlodipine group so that the changes in these
      parameters were significantly different between the two study groups (P= 0.041, P
      = 0.042 and P = 0.015, respectively). Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1
      (PAI-1) antigen and PAI-1 activity were only decreased in the rilmenidine group
      (not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that
      rilmenidine and amlodipine have a comparable anti-hypertensive effect but only
      rilmenidine is able to improve glucose metabolism.

TI  - Treatment of arterial hypertension in the elderly with diltiazem vs ramipril.
PG  - 183-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Around 40% of the elderly population suffer from arterial
      hypertension. An effective antihypertensive treatment is therefore required.
      Calcium antagonists are used to treat hypertension because, owing to their
      mechanism of action, they can provoke systemic, as well as coronary
      vasodilatation. In this study the authors aimed to evaluate the activity and
      tolerability of diltiazem compared to ramipril in a group of elderly patients
      suffering from essential arterial hypertension. METHODS: A controlled
      single-blind study was performed in which patients were randomly assigned to one 
      of two groups, A and B, consisting of 25 patients each, treated respectively with
      300 mg sustained-release diltiazem or 5 mg ramipril in a single daily dose. The
      study lasted 6 months and evaluated systolic and diastolic pressure and heart
      rate. RESULTS: The evolution was positive in all patients in Group A and most
      patients in Group B, with the normalisation of both systolic and diastolic
      values. Heart rate showed a more persistent fall in Group A, but this was
      expected owing to the mechanism of action of diltiazem. No patient in Group A had
      to suspend treatment, whereas one patient in Group B had to interrupt therapy
      following the onset of a persistent cough. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments resulted 
      in similar changes in systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. In the
      light of these results, it can be affirmed that, at an oral dose of 300 mg/day,
      sustained-release diltiazem was found to be effective and well tolerated in the
      treatment of mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension in the aged.

TI  - Treatment of hypertensive children with amlodipine.
PG  - 1061-6
AB  - Amlodipine, a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking agent, was
      administered to 55 children (age: 11.5 +/- 5.4 years) with hypertension, 49 of
      whom (89%) had secondary hypertension. Efficacy was assessed by comparing
      pretreatment blood pressure (BP) to follow-up BP obtained in our outpatient
      Pediatric Nephrology clinic. Thirty-two (58%) patients achieved BP control with
      amlodipine alone, and 31 (55%) patients received amlodipine twice daily. Eleven
      patients received amlodipine as a suspension. Mean amlodipine dose was 0.16 +/-
      0.12 mg/kg/day; there was an inverse relationship between patient age and
      amlodipine dose. Follow-up BP were significantly lower than pretreatment BP:
      systolic BP fell from 129 +/- 12 to 122 +/- 12 mm Hg (P = .004), and diastolic BP
      fell from 78 +/- 13 to 70 +/- 19 mm Hg (P = .003). A small, clinically
      insignificant increase in heart rate (from 91 +/- 19 beats/min to 99 +/- 26
      beats/min; P = .02) occurred during amlodipine treatment. Adverse effects
      reported included dizziness (three patients), fatigue (two patients), flushing
      (two patients), and leg edema (one patient). All improved with dose reduction. We
      conclude that amlodipine provides effective BP control without significant
      adverse effects in children with hypertension, and can be used as monotherapy in 
      most children. Young children appear to require significantly higher doses per
      kilogram of body weight than older children. Twice-daily dosing may be required
      in many children to achieve BP control. Detailed pharmacokinetic studies are
      needed to confirm these observations.

      stones.
PG  - 579-82
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of medical therapy during watchful
      waiting in patients with distal ureter stones. METHODS: Ninety-six patients with 
      radiopaque stones located in the distal tract of the ureter and with stone sizes 
      of 1 cm or smaller were involved in the study. The patients were randomly divided
      into two groups. Group A (n = 48) received oral treatment with 30 mg of
      deflazacort daily (maximum 10 days) plus 30 mg of slow-release nifedipine daily
      (maximum 4 weeks). Group B (n = 48) underwent a wait-and-watch approach. Both
      groups of patients were allowed to use diclofenac on demand. Statistical analyses
      were carried out using Student's t test, the chi-square test, and Fisher's exact 
      test. RESULTS: The average stone size was 5.8 +/- 1.8 mm for group A and 5. 5 +/-
      1.4 mm for group B. No statistically significant difference was found in stone
      size. Stone expulsion was observed in 38 (79%) of 48 patients in group A and in
      17 (35%) of 48 patients in group B. The average expulsion time was 7 days (range 
      2 to 10) for group A and 20 days (range 10 to 28) for group B. A statistically
      significant difference was observed in both the expulsion rate and the expulsion 
      time (P <0.05). The mean amount of sodium diclofenac used was 15 mg per patient
      for group A and 105 mg per patient for group B (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The
      medical treatment proved to be effective and safe, as demonstrated by the
      increased stone expulsion rate, decreased expulsion time, and reduced need for
      analgesic therapy.

PG  - 575-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare two treatment regimens in patients with ureteral calculi. 
      One regimen (control arm) used routine drugs, and the second regimen (treatment
      arm) used the same routine drugs plus uncommonly used drugs. METHODS: Between
      February and October 1998, 70 consecutive patients were evaluated for symptomatic
      ureteral calculi. Thirty-five patients were randomized to a control arm and
      received ketorolac, oxycodone, and acetaminophen combination tablets and
      prochlorperazine suppositories. Thirty-five patients were randomized to the
      treatment arm and received the same medications plus nifedipine XL, prednisone,
      and trimethoprim/sulfa combination tablets and plain acetaminophen. Stone passage
      rates, work days lost, emergency room visits, surgical interventions, and
      possible side effects of the drugs were recorded. RESULTS: The treatment arm
      (addition of nifedipine XL, prednisone, trimethoprim/sulfa, and plain
      acetaminophen) had higher (86% versus 56%) stone passage rates and fewer lost
      work days (mean 1.76 versus 4.9), emergency room visits (1 versus 4), and
      surgical interventions (2 versus 15). Both arms exhibited similar potential drug 
      side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a calcium channel blocking agent,
      steroids, antibiotics, and more acetaminophen effected a higher stone passage
      rate and fewer lost work days, emergency room visits, and surgical interventions.

TI  - Calcium channel blocker ingestions in children.
PG  - 581-6
AB  - Limited data exists regarding toxicity of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in
      children. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency, the range of 
      toxicity, the appropriate observation time, and to assess effective interventions
      for CCB ingestions in children. A 6-year retrospective review of CCB ingestions
      in children younger than 7 years of age reported to one regional poison center
      was undertaken. Patients with coingestants with recognized cardiovascular or
      central nervous system (CNS) effects were excluded. Two hundred eighty-three
      patients met criteria for review. The mean age was 27 months with 52% of all
      patients being boys. Nifedipine (38%), verapamil (34%), and amlodipine (14%) were
      most commonly ingested. Seventy-five percent of ingestions reportedly involved < 
      or =1 pill. Symptoms occurred in 16/283 (6%): 4 had vomiting, and 12 had CNS or
      cardiovascular effects. The mean time to onset of symptoms for regular-release
      and for sustained-release (SR) CCB preparations were 1.5 hours (range 0.5 to 3
      hr) and 4.5 hours (range 1 to 14 hr) respectively. Outcome: 74% of patients had
      no clinical effects, 4% minor effects, 2% moderate effects, and 20% other. No
      deaths or major effects were reported. Treatment: 88% of patients evaluated in an
      emergency department received gastric decontamination, usually one dose of
      charcoal. Calcium chloride was given in three verapamil SR cases. Five of six
      patients had reversal of hypotension with IV fluids and decontamination alone.
      Most pediatric CCB ingestions involve ingestions of small amounts of drug with no
      effects. Asymptomatic children in this study group who were known to have
      ingested <12 mg/kg of verapamil SR or <2.7 mg/kg of nifedipine SR could have been
      monitored at home. Of the children requiring evaluation and monitoring in a
      health care facility, an observation period for regular-release and SR-CCBs for 3
      and 14 hours respectively would have been appropriate. There were insufficient
      cases with symptoms to draw conclusions for optimal therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Retrospective evaluation of the conversion of amlodipine to alternative calcium
      channel blockers.
PG  - 1072-8
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and costs associated with
      a formulary conversion from amlodipine to alternative calcium channel blockers.
      DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PATIENTS: 
      One hundred patients with hypertension who were receiving amlodipine.
      INTERVENTION: Data from a random sample of 100 patients who were taking
      amlodipine and converted to a formulary calcium channel blocker from February 1, 
      1999-October 30, 1999, were entered into an Excel database for evaluation of the 
      conversion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were required to have a
      diagnosis of hypertension and have had two consecutive clinic visits with blood
      pressure measurements (and no changes in antihypertensive therapy) before
      conversion. End points were changes in average systolic blood pressure, diastolic
      blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) from the two clinic visits
      before and after conversion. In addition, data were collected and analyzed with
      regard to adverse drug reactions, average dosage of the alternative calcium
      channel blocker, number of additional antihypertensives begun or discontinued,
      and number of dosage changes in antihypertensives within the two visits after
      conversion, and the overall cost impact of conversion. Average systolic blood
      pressure was reduced from 141.6 +/- 15.1 to 139.2 +/- 15.3 mm Hg after the
      conversion (NS). Average diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced from 
      74 +/- 9.5 to 72.6 +/- 10.1 mm Hg after conversion (p=0.032), as was MAP (97.0
      +/-q 9.3 to 94.8 +/- 10.0 mm Hg, p=0.026). Five patients had other changes in
      therapy made concurrently at the time of conversion, and 19 had changes after
      conversion. When these patients were excluded from analysis, the reduction in
      systolic blood pressure after conversion was significant (141.4 +/- 14.5 to 137.7
      +/- 14.3 mm Hg, p=0.022), as were reductions in diastolic blood pressure (74.4
      +/- 9.4 to 71.7 +/- 9.8 mm Hg, p=0.014) and MAP (96.7 +/- 9.1 to 93.7 +/- 9.3 mm 
      Hg, p=0.007). Of patients who had postconversion changes in therapy, 8 (42%) were
      converted to diltiazem ER, nifedipine CC, or doses of felodipine that were 50% of
      the original dose of amlodipine. The overall cost impact of the conversion was a 
      net savings of $14,858/year for each 100 patients converted. CONCLUSION:
      Conversion from amlodipine to other calcium channel blockers resulted in
      statistically significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure and MAP, and was
      safe as well as cost-effective. Conversion to calcium channel antagonists other
      than felodipine or less than equal dosages of felodipine may require dosage
      titration. When converting patients from amlodipine, dosages usually should be
      equal to those of felodipine; if converting to other calcium channel antagonists,
      the need for adjustments should be anticipated.

TI  - Efficacy of candesartan cilexetil alone or in combination with amlodipine and
      hydrochlorothiazide in moderate-to-severe hypertension. UK and Israel Candesartan
      Investigators.
PG  - 454-60
AB  - This multicenter study evaluated the efficacy of candesartan cilexetil, an
      angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, used alone or in combination with
      amlodipine or in combination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide in the
      treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe essential hypertension. After a
      2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients entered a 12-week,
      open-label, dose-titration period. The candesartan cilexetil dose was increased
      from 8 to 16 mg once daily; amlodipine (5 mg once daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25
      mg once daily), and additional medication were also added sequentially if
      necessary. Patients then entered a final 4-week, parallel-group, double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled withdrawal period of candesartan alone. A total of
      216 patients were recruited. After a 2-week run-in period on placebo tablets,
      mean sitting blood pressure (BP) was 175/108 mm Hg. At the end of the 12-week
      dose-titration/maintenance period, mean sitting BP fell to 141/88 mm Hg. In 67
      patients who were randomized to placebo and had their candesartan withdrawn,
      there was a highly significant increase in mean systolic/diastolic BP (13/6 mm
      Hg) compared with those patients who continued with candesartan (ANCOVA,
      P:<0.0001). In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil is an effective BP-lowering drug
      when used alone or in combination with amlodipine or amlodipine plus
      hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of moderate-to-severe essential
      hypertension. The drug was well tolerated throughout the investigation period.

TI  - Modulation of tear film protein secretion with phosphodiesterase inhibitors.
PG  - 208-11
AB  - A double-blind randomized clinical study was conducted to determine whether
      nicardipine hydrochloride was a useful treatment for dry eye.We examined its
      effect on the tear film, ocular surface and ocular comfort. Nicardipine
      hydrochloride, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and pilocarpine hydrochloride were
      dissolved in an artificial tear vehicle and applied topically to one eye of 12
      subjects on separate days. Ocular physiology, ocular comfort and tear volume were
      assessed. The trial was repeated with nicardipine in an aqueous gel vehicle.
      Tears were collected and assessed for protein concentration and protein profile, 
      using electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Nicardipine induced conjunctival
      redness and symptoms of dryness and irritation. There was no change in total tear
      protein concentration or volume. An increase in a 68 kDa protein was observed,
      this was probably due to conjunctival vessel dilation and leakage of albumin. The
      adverse symptomatology and increased conjunctival redness experienced with
      nicardipine make it an undesirable treatment for dry eye.

TI  - The efficacy of divalproex sodium in the prophylactic treatment of children with 
      migraine.
PG  - 672-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the beneficial use of divalproex sodium as a prophylactic
      treatment for migraine in children. BACKGROUND: Previous studies for treatment of
      migraine in adults have shown a greater than 50% reduction in migraine attack
      frequencies. Few data exist, however, regarding the efficacy and safety of
      divalproex sodium use in children with migraine. METHODS: We studied the
      incidence of headache relief in our patients with migraine aged 16 years and
      younger treated with divalproex sodium prophylactically at our institution from
      July 1996 to December 1998 to determine medication dosage used, concomitant
      headache medications, and possible adverse effects. RESULTS: A total of 42
      patients, ranging in age from 7 to 16 years (mean age, 11.3 years), were treated 
      with divalproex sodium for headache. All had a history of migraine with or
      without aura. Baseline headache frequency during a minimum 6-month period was one
      to four headaches per month. Divalproex sodium dosage ranged from 15 mg/kg/day to
      45 mg/kg/day. Of the 42 patients, 34 (80.9%) successfully discontinued their
      abortive medications. After 4 months' treatment, 50% headache reduction was seen 
      in 78.5% of patients, 75% reduction in 14.2% of patients, and 9. 5% of patients
      became headache-free. CONCLUSION: These results indicate divalproex sodium to be 
      an effective and well-tolerated treatment for the prophylaxis of migraine in
      children.

TI  - Clinically additive effect between doxazosin and amlodipine in the treatment of
      essential hypertension.
PG  - 921-6
AB  - The Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment 
      of High Blood Pressure has reported that combinations of low doses of
      antihypertensive agents from different classes may provide additional
      antihypertensive efficacy and minimize the likelihood of dose-dependent adverse
      effects. Doxazosin and amlodipine, alone and in combination, were compared for
      efficacy in reducing blood pressure (BP) in 75 patients with predominantly
      moderate (Stage 2) hypertension. This was a double-blind, randomized, crossover
      study. After a 2-week washout period, patients in group A (n = 37) received
      amlodipine 10 mg and patients in group B (n = 38) received doxazosin 4 mg for 6
      weeks. All patients then received reduced-dose combination therapy (amlodipine 5 
      mg and doxazosin 2 mg) for 6 weeks. Subsequently, patients received 6 weeks of
      monotherapy with the alternate medication (group A received doxazosin 4 mg and
      group B received amlodipine 10 mg). During both monotherapy periods, doxazosin
      and amlodipine significantly reduced systolic and diastolic BP (P < .001 v
      baseline). BP further decreased with combination therapy (P < .01 v monotherapy).
      The percentage of patients with Stage 2 hypertension who achieved a target BP of 
      < 140/< 90 mm Hg increased from 78% with monotherapy to 94% with combination
      therapy. Fewer adverse effects were observed during combination therapy. It is
      concluded that there is an additional fall in blood pressure when reduced doses
      of doxazosin and amlodipine are used in combination for the treatment of
      hypertension, suggesting that doxazosin should be considered as an effective
      add-on treatment to calcium-channel blockers.

TI  - Evaluation of the effects of fixed combinations of sustained-release
      verapamil/trandolapril versus captopril/hydrochlorothiazide on metabolic and
      electrolyte parameters in patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 347-54
AB  - The objective of this randomised open, active controlled, cross-over study was to
      evaluate the effect of a fixed combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril compared 
      to captopril/hydrochlorothiazide on serum lipids, lipoproteins, and other
      metabolic and electrolyte parameters in patients with essential hypertension.
      Another objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of both combinations. One
      hundred hypertensives with systolic blood pressure 140-209 mm Hg and diastolic
      blood pressure 90-119 mm Hg were evaluated after 16 weeks receiving a fixed
      combination of verapamil SR 180 mg/ trandolapril 2 mg (VT) or captopril 50
      mg/hydro- chlorothiazide 25 mg (CH) both given once daily. Lipids and
      lipoproteins were assessed in duplicate on 2 consecutive days. The study was
      completed by 80 patients. There was no statistically significant difference
      between the two combined regimens with respect to low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL)-cholesterol for the 'intention-to-treat' population measured at the end of 
      each treatment period (3.44 +/- 0.87 mmol/L with VT, and 3.46 +/- 0.86 mmol/L
      with CH). No differences were found for other lipid parameters like total
      cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A1 and B, Lp(a). High-density
      lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was significantly higher with VT (1.39 +/- 0.01 vs 
      1.35 +/- 0.01, P < 0. 03). Serum potassium declined while uric acid and glucose
      increased on CH. In conclusion, no significant differences were found in
      LDL-cholesterol and in other lipid parameters with the exception of
      HDL-cholesterol which was significantly higher on VT. Serum potassium declined
      while uric acid and glucose increased on CH (all significantly). Both fixed
      combinations were well tolerated. The incidence of adverse events was higher on
      CH. Both fixed combinations significantly lowered BP. Journal of Human
      Hypertension (2000) 14, 347-354

TI  - The use of calcium salts in the prevention and management of verapamil-induced
      hypotension.
PG  - 622-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the available literature on the use of intravenous calcium
      salts for the prevention of hypotension associated with intravenous verapamil.
      METHODS: A MEDLINE search (1966-June 1999) identified pertinent articles;
      references from these articles were identified to serve as additional resources. 
      DISCUSSION: Verapamil is effective in inhibiting atrioventricular nodal
      conduction, thereby controlling ventricular rate in patients with atrial
      fibrillation/flutter and terminating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
      However, hypotension may be caused by the negative inotropic and vasodilating
      effects of verapamil. In vitro and animal data suggest that calcium pretreatment 
      may minimize the effects of verapamil on cardiac output and blood pressure. Case 
      reports suggest that intravenous calcium may be useful for both prevention and
      reversal of the hemodynamic effects of verapamil. A number of small clinical
      trials have been performed, suggesting that calcium administered prior to
      intravenous verapamil results in a decreased incidence of hypotension. The most
      common adverse effect of intravenous calcium is flushing. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium
      pretreatment prior to intravenous calcium-channel blocker administration should
      be considered in patients in whom further reductions in blood pressure may
      precipitate hypoperfusion or worsen underlying cardiovascular status. A dose of
      calcium gluconate 1 g (ionized calcium 90 mg) administered over three minutes is 
      recommended for preventing or lessening the hypotensive effect of verapamil
      without affecting the antiarrhythmic effects of verapamil.

TI  - Neonatal poisonings in middle Anatolia of Turkey: an analysis of 72 cases.
PG  - 115-9
AB  - In this study, 72 newborn infants who were followed with the diagnosis of
      poisoning in Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics,
      Division of Neonatology, between 1975 and 1997 were evaluated retrospectively.
      Our purpose was to emphasize the importance of newborn poisoning among general
      poisoning in childhood. The age of infants ranged from 10 min to 25 days (0.82
      +/- 2.81 days). Forty-seven (65.2%) infants were poisoned before or during
      delivery. Of the 47 infants' mothers, 46 had preeclampsia or eclampsia, and 27
      received only magnesium sulfate; nine magnesium sulfate + diazepam; four
      magnesium sulfate + nifedipine; and the others received various drug
      combinations. Aside from these, one mother had Addison's disease and she used
      long-term dexamethasone during her pregnancy. In the newborn period, five (6.9%) 
      infants inhaled organophosphate insecticides; eight (11.1%) ingested corrosive
      agents (four benzalkonium chloride; three chlorhexidine gluconate + cetrimide and
      an infant ammonium); four (5.5%) were poisoned by overdose of digoxin; three
      (4.1%) ingested overdose of phenobarbital; and two (2.7%) received acepromazine
      maleate. In addition, each infant ingested diphenoxilate HCL + atropine sulfate, 
      pipenzolate bromid and tizanidine HCL. Follow-up period of the infants ranged
      from 24 hr to 26 days (0.82 +/- 2.81 days). The mortality rate was 17% (12/72).
      Death was not noted in the infants who were followed with poisoning after
      delivery. The causes of death were as follows: sepsis in four infants,
      meningitis, respiratory distress syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis in two
      infants each, and the effects of overdose of magnesium sulfate and diazepam in
      two infants, respectively. In conclusion, we would like to stress that newborn
      infants whose mothers received magnesium sulfate or another drug during pregnancy
      or delivery should be closely monitored, and calculation of drug doses should be 
      carefully taught to hospital nurses. When baby-rooms are disinfected with
      organophosphate insecticides in a hospital or house, infants should be removed
      from the room for at least 24 hr, and use of drugs should be explained in detail 
      to the mothers.

TI  - Evaluation of amlodipine, lisinopril, and a combination in the treatment of
      essential hypertension.
PG  - 350-3
AB  - Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and dihydropyridine calcium
      antagonists are well established and widely used as monotherapy in patients with 
      mild to moderate essential hypertension. Earlier studies combining short acting
      drugs from these classes require multiple dosing and were associated with poor
      compliance. Availability of longer acting compounds allows once daily
      administration to avoid the inconvenience of a multiple daily dose. It was
      decided to perform a randomised double blind, crossover study with the long
      acting calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the long acting ACE inhibitor
      lisinopril, given either alone or in combination in essential hypertension.
      Twenty four patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 104 mm Hg
      received amlodipine 2.5 mg and 5 mg, lisinopril 5 mg and 10 mg, and their
      combination as per a prior randomisation schedule. Supine and standing blood
      pressure and heart rate were recorded at weekly intervals. Higher doses of both
      the drugs individually or in combination were used if the target supine DBP below
      90 mm Hg was not achieved. There was a significant additional blood pressure
      lowering effect with the combination when compared either with amlodipine or
      lisinopril alone. Five mg amlodipine and 10 mg lisinopril monotherapy achieved
      the target blood pressure in 71% and 72% patients respectively. The combination
      of 2.5 mg amlodipine with 5 mg lisinopril produced a much more significant
      lowering of blood pressure in a higher percentage of patients than that with an
      individual low dose.

TI  - Treatment of heart failure guided by plasma aminoterminal brain natriuretic
      peptide (N-BNP) concentrations.
PG  - 1126-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is currently no objective practical guide to intensity of drug 
      treatment for individuals with heart failure. We hypothesised that
      pharmacotherapy guided by plasma concentrations of the cardiac peptide
      aminoterminal brain natriuretic peptide (N-BNP) would produce a superior outcome 
      to empirical trial-based therapy dictated by clinical acumen. METHODS: 69
      patients with impaired systolic function (left-ventricular ejection fraction
      <40%) and symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II-IV) were
      randomised to receive treatment guided by either plasma N-BNP concentration (BNP 
      group) or standardised clinical assessment (clinical group). FINDINGS: During
      follow-up (minimum 6-months, median 9.5 months), there were fewer total
      cardiovascular events (death, hospital admission, or heart failure
      decompensation) in the BNP group than in the clinical group (19 vs 54, p=0.02).
      At 6 months, 27% of patients in the BNP group and 53% in the clinical group had
      experienced a first cardiovascular event (p=0.034). Changes in left-ventricular
      function, quality of life, renal function, and adverse events were similar in
      both groups. INTERPRETATION: N-BNP-guided treatment of heart failure reduced
      total cardiovascular events, and delayed time to first event compared with
      intensive clinically guided treatment.

TI  - Antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of once-daily sustained-release
      diltiazem alone and in combination with ramipril in hypertension.
PG  - 962-5
AB  - This study assessed once-daily (OD), sustained-release (SR) diltiazem alone and
      in combination with ramipril in essential hypertension. Fifty patients with
      supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 95-< or = 114 mm Hg were entered
      into the active treatment phase of the study after 2 weeks of placebo run-in.
      Sustained-release diltiazem 180 mg OD was administered for 2 weeks, then
      optimally titrated, at 2 week intervals, to SR diltiazem 240 mg OD and then SR
      diltiazem 180 mg + ramipril 2.5 mg OD to achieve supine DBP < or = 90 mm Hg.
      After 4 weeks of diltiazem monotherapy (SR diltiazem 180 mg or 240 mg OD) mean
      supine DBP was reduced from 102.84 +/- 3.81 mm Hg to 90.15 +/- 5.02 mm Hg (P <
      0.01) and mean supine heart rate was reduced from 85.15 +/- 11.02 bpm to 77.62
      +/- 11.45 bpm (p < 0.01). Diltiazem monotherapy reduced supine DBP to < or = 90
      mm Hg in 35/45 (77.77%) patients. Combination therapy (SR diltiazem 180 mg +
      ramipril 2.5 mg OD), received by non-responders to diltiazem monotherapy, reduced
      supine DBP to < or = 90 mm Hg in 3/10 (30%) patients. Sinus bradycardia was
      observed in one patient. Sustained-release diltiazem alone and in combination
      with ramipril reduce blood pressure in a dose related manner and is well
      tolerated.

TI  - Cardiovascular adverse drug reaction associated with combined beta-adrenergic and
      calcium entry-blocking agents.
PG  - 556-9
AB  - Numerous studies have shown a beneficial effect of combination therapy with
      beta-blockers and calcium antagonists in patients with anginal syndrome and/or
      hypertension. However, because both agents exert a negative chronotropic effect, 
      their combined use may cause bradyarrhythmias with resultant symptoms of
      cerebral, coronary, and systemic hypoperfusion. We describe our clinical
      experience with patients who had cardiovascular adverse drug reactions (CVADRs)
      with combination therapy. This prospective study included 26 patients who had
      CVADRs among 2,574 admissions during a 2-year period. The study group included 14
      men and 12 women with a median age of 73 years. Various combinations of calcium
      antagonists and beta-blockers were associated with the CVADRs. The most frequent 
      pharmacologic combination was diltiazem plus propranolol. The CVADRs were the
      cause for hospital admission in 10 patients, an associated cause in nine
      patients, and developed during hospitalization in seven patients. Cardiac
      bradyarrhythmias were found in 22 patients. These rhythm abnormalities resolved
      within 24 h after discontinuation of the offending drugs. Temporary transvenous
      pacemaker insertion was necessary in only one patient with complete
      atrioventricular block. Twenty-two patients recovered, two patients died of pump 
      failure not associated with CVADRs, and in two patients, the CVADRs contributed
      to the patients' death. CVADRs are not uncommon in elderly patients with ischemic
      heart disease and/or hypertension treated with the concomitant use of calcium
      antagonist and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Use of calcium antagonist plus
      beta-blocker may unpredictably cause serious hemodynamic events, marked
      suppression of sinus node activity, and prolongation of atrioventricular
      conduction in some patients. Enhanced therapeutic monitoring may be warranted
      when calcium antagonists are combined with beta-blockers.

TI  - Esophageal motility disorders: current concepts of pathogenesis and treatment.
PG  - 221-31
AB  - Current concepts of esophageal motility disorders are summarized. Primary data
      sources were located via MEDLINE or cross-citation. No attempt was made to be
      comprehensive or inclusive of the literature because fewer than 10% of citations 
      are discussed. Instead, emphasis was placed on new developments in diagnosis,
      therapeutics and practice patterns. Controlled therapeutic trials and
      pathophysiological observations are emphasized. Achalasia is a rare disease of
      failed lower sphincter relaxation and aperistalsis. Diffuse esophageal spasm
      (DES), an equally rare disease, is defined by nonpropagated esophageal
      contractions. Nonspecific motility disorders, including nutcracker esophagus and 
      hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter, are identified only by manometry and are
      10 times as prevalent. Neuromuscular pathology is evident only with achalasia
      (myenteric plexus neuron destruction). Pharmacological therapies have limited
      efficacy with achalasia, more limited efficacy with DES and no efficacy with the 
      nonspecific motility disorders. More efficacious therapies for the nonspecific
      disorders are directed at associated reflux disease or psychiatric disorders.
      Pneumatic dilation is effective therapy for achalasia in 72% of instances but
      frequently requires repeat dilation and is complicated by a 3% perforation rate. 
      Surgical myotomy is effective in 88% of patients with achalasia; morbidity from
      thoracotomy has been the major limitation but has been sharply reduced with a
      laparoscopic approach. In conclusion, although it has been suggested that
      esophageal motility disorders are distinct clinical entities, critical review of 
      the literature supports this only in the case of achalasia, a disease of well
      defined pathophysiology, functional disturbance and therapies. This clarity
      diminishes progressively for DES and nonspecific esophageal motility disorders.

TI  - Effects of isradipine, a dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonist, on
      D-methamphetamine-induced cognitive and physiological changes in humans.
PG  - 504-12
AB  - D-methamphetamine is abused for its euphoric effects and stimulatory action on
      cognitive function. Its abuse can, however, be associated with massive
      hypertension resulting in strokes, ruptured aneurysms, or myocardial infarction. 
      We examined the utility of isradipine, a dihydropyridine-class calcium channel
      antagonist, in treating d-methamphetamine induced hypertension and evaluated its 
      effects on cognitive function, both of which are mediated by dopaminergic
      mechanisms. D-methamphetamine dose-dependently increased all vital signs
      (systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, and pulse rate) parameters.
      Isradipine significantly reduced d-methamphetamine-induced increases in diastolic
      and mean arterial pressure; however, this potentially beneficial therapeutic
      effect was offset by a significant reflex rise in pulse rate. D-methamphetamine
      also improved attention, accuracy of reasoning ability, and performance on
      computerized cognitive function tasks. D-methamphetamine's cognitive improving
      effects were not altered significantly by isradipine. Isradipine increased the
      false responding rate but was without significant effect on any other attentional
      task, or on reasoning ability, or performance. Isradipine does not appear to
      enhance cognitive function in healthy humans.

TI  - Natural history of erythromelalgia: presentation and outcome in 168 patients.
PG  - 330-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographics, presentation, and outcome in patients
      with erythromelalgia--a rare and poorly understood clinical syndrome defined by
      the triad of red, hot, painful extremities. DESIGN: Retrospective medical record 
      review with follow-up by survey questionnaire. SETTING: Large tertiary care
      medical center. SUBJECTS: Patients with erythromelalgia examined at the Mayo
      Clinic, Rochester, Minn, between 1970 and 1994. INTERVENTION: The medical records
      of 168 patients were analyzed. Follow-up data, which consisted of answers to 2
      survey questionnaires or the most recent information in the medical record from
      patients still alive and death certificates or reports of death for those
      deceased patients, were obtained for all but 13 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Survival, morbidity, and quality of life. RESULTS: All patients were white; 122
      (72.6%) were female, and 46 (27.4%) were male. At presentation, the patients'
      mean age was 55.8 years (age range, 5-91 years). Symptoms had been present since 
      childhood in 7 patients (4.2%). Six patients (3.6%) had a first-degree relative
      with erythromelalgia. Symptoms were intermittent in 163 patients (97.0%) and
      constant in 5 (3.0%). Symptoms predominantly involved feet (148 patients [88.1%])
      and hands (43 patients [25.6%]). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed a
      significant decrease in survival compared with that expected in persons of
      similar age and of the same sex (P<.001). After a mean follow-up of 8.7 years
      (range, 1.3-20 years), 30 patients (31.9%) reported worsening of, 25 (26.6%) no
      change in, 29 (30.9%) improvement in, and 10 (10.6%) complete resolution of the
      symptoms. On a standard health status questionnaire, scores for all but one of
      the health domains were significantly diminished in comparison with those in the 
      US general population. CONCLUSION: Erythromelalgia is a syndrome with
      significantly increased mortality and morbidity compared with the US general
      population.

TI  - The calcium channel blocker used with cyclosporin has an effect on gingival
      overgrowth.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate whether the choice of calcium channel blocker,
      used in conjunction with cyclosporin A, affected the prevalence of gingival
      overgrowth. METHOD: A cohort of 135 renal transplant recipients who had been
      medicated with cyclosporin A in combination with either nifedipine (89) or
      amlodipine (46) since transplant, took part in the study. The inclusion criteria 
      were that eligible subjects had been in receipt of a kidney transplant for at
      least 12 months, had at least 10 teeth and had not received specialist
      periodontal treatment. The age, gender, current drug regimen and dosage were
      recorded for each participant and alginate impressions taken of both arches. The 
      presence and severity of gingival overgrowth were scored from plaster models.
      RESULTS: A higher proportion (72%) of the amlodipine group were categorised as
      having gingival overgrowth compared with only 53% of the nifedipine group, chi
      square=4.5, p<0.05. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the
      relationship between the presence or absence of gingival overgrowth (dependent
      variable) and age, gender, time since transplant, dose of cyclosporin A, centre
      in which the patient was treated, and the calcium channel blocker used
      (independent variables). Independent predictors of gingival overgrowth in this
      multivariate analysis were whether the individual was treated with amlodipine or 
      nifedipine (p=0.01) and whether the individual was young or old (p=0.01). Within 
      the multivariate analysis, the odds ratio for amlodipine to be associated with
      gingival overgrowth compared with nifedipine was 3.0 (confidence interval
      1.3-6.9). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of gingival overgrowth in renal transplant 
      recipients maintained on cyclosporin A and nifedipine is lower than those treated
      with cyclosporin A and amlodipine.

TI  - Amlodipine, enalapril, and dependent leg edema in essential hypertension.
PG  - 621-5
AB  - Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) blunt postural skin vasoconstriction, an
      autoregulatory mechanism that minimizes gravitational increases in capillary
      pressure and avoids fluid extravasation when standing. To evaluate the
      dose-response relation between this pharmacological interference and dependent
      edema, a frequent side effect of CCBs during antihypertensive treatment, skin
      blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry) at the dorsum of the foot, both supine and
      with the limb passively placed 50 cm below the heart level, and leg weight
      (Archimedes principle) were measured at baseline, during increasing doses of the 
      dihydropyridine amlodipine (5 and 10 mg UID each for 2 weeks), and after drug
      withdrawal in 10 hypertensive men. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitors may attenuate ankle swelling by CCBs, those parameters were evaluated 
      according to a similar design during amlodipine (10 mg UID) and enalapril (20 mg 
      UID) combined (n=10). As a control, the effect of enalapril monotherapy (10 and
      20 mg UID for 2 weeks each) was evaluated in a third series of patients (n=8).
      Amlodipine (5 mg UID) increased leg weight without modifying postural
      vasoconstriction (the percent skin blood flow decrease from horizontal to
      dependent position), which indicates that extravascular fluid shift was
      independent of postural skin vasoconstriction. At 10 mg UID, however, amlodipine 
      blunted postural vasoconstriction and increased leg weight further, which
      suggests that skin blood flow autoregulation limited additional fluid transfer.
      Both parameters normalized after drug withdrawal. Enalapril per se did not affect
      cutaneous vasomotion or leg weight but reduced the amount of dependent fluid
      extravasation by the CCB despite a persistent antagonism for postural
      vasoconstrictor responses.

TI  - The effect of amlodipine and enalapril on blood pressure and neurohumoral
      activation in hypertensive patients with Ribbing's disease (multiple epiphysal
      dystrophy).
PG  - 109-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with Ribbing's disease (RD)--a form of multiple epiphysal
      dystrophy--hypertension is frequent, often severe, and accompanied by a relevant 
      cardiac dysfunction. HYPOTHESIS: This study was undertaken to evaluate the
      contribution of the calcium antagonist amlodipine and of the
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril to blood pressure regulation by
      studying their effect on neurohormonal activation. METHODS: Fifty hypertensive
      patients with RD were studied. After a placebo run-in period of 4 to 6 weeks,
      patients were randomly assigned to receive either amlodipine (10 mg once daily)
      or enalapril (20 mg once daily) for 6 months. RESULTS: Both drugs significantly
      lowered blood pressure. Enalapril did not result in activation of the sympathetic
      system (as determined by measurement of the plasma norepinephrine level). On the 
      other hand, the hypotensive effect of amlodipine occurred with an increase in
      heart rate and in the levels of plasma norepinephrine and angiotensin II.
      CONCLUSION: It is unclear whether amlodipine may reduce cardiac dysfunction in
      patients with RD.

TI  - Intravenous nicardipine for severe hypertension in pre-eclampsia--effects of an
      acute treatment on mother and foetus.
PG  - 1277-81
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy in lowering blood pressure, and the safety for
      mother and foetus of an acute nicardipine therapy in severe pre-eclampsia.
      DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: One university hospital obstetric
      unit. PATIENTS: Twenty consecutive adult pre-eclamptic patients with severe
      hypertension. INTERVENTION: Nicardipine, 1 microgram/kg per min, was given
      intravenously to lower the mean arterial pressure (MAP) by at least 15%. Then,
      the dosage was reduced by 1/3, and the final dosage was determined to maintain
      MAP at 20-30% below the initial value, by increasing or decreasing the infusion
      rate by 0.5 mg/h. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Maternal MAP and heart rate (HR) were
      assessed every 5 min for 1 h. Foetal HR (FHR) was recorded throughout the study
      period and assessed for Fischer score. Gestational age, Apgar scores, birth
      weight, capillary filling time and the duration of stay in the paediatric
      intensive care unit (ICU) were used to evaluate the short-term perinatal outcome.
      A 15-30% decrease in MAP occurred within 15-20 min in all patients. An increase
      in HR was noted, and two patients had severe tachycardia. Maternal side effects
      included flushing, headache, nausea and dizziness. FHR showed a transient
      decrease in acceleration episodes and occurrence of decelerations. No
      nicardipine-related foetal distress occurred. Four infants born during the study 
      period did well at birth and had a good outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Acute nicardipine
      therapy can induce severe maternal tachycardia. No severe foetal or neonatal
      adverse effects occurred. This dose scheme requires comparison with alternative
      therapeutic options.

TI  - The use of esmolol, nicardipine, or their combination to blunt hemodynamic
      changes after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.
PG  - 280-5
AB  - Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation (LTI) often provoke an undesirable increase 
      in blood pressure (BP) and/or heart rate (HR). We tested the premise that
      nicardipine (NIC) and esmolol (ESM) in combination (COMB) would oppose both.
      Adult surgical patients received pretreatment (randomized) with IV bolus NIC 30
      microg/kg (n = 31), ESM 1.0 mg/kg (n = 34), or COMB (one-half dose each, n = 32).
      Peak BP and HR after LTI were compared with controls (CONT; n = 35) with no
      pretreatment. Anesthetic induction was standardized: IV thiopental (5-7 mg/kg),
      fentanyl (1-2 microg/kg), and succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg). Systolic (S),
      diastolic (D), and mean (M) BP and HR awake before pretreatment (baseline) were
      similar in all test groups. No patient was treated for hypotension, bradycardia, 
      or tachycardia after pretreatment or anesthetic induction. Peak HR after LTI was 
      increased versus baseline in CONT and all test groups, but did not differ from
      CONT among the test groups. Peak SBP and DBP increased versus baseline in CONT,
      and with ESM and NIC, but not COMB. Peak SBP, DBP, and MBP were increased with
      ESM versus COMB, and peak DBP with ESM versus NIC. Compared with no pretreatment 
      before the IV induction of general anesthesia, the peak increase in BP after LTI 
      is best blunted by the combination of nicardipine and ESM, compared with either
      drug alone. No single drug or combination in the doses tested opposed increased
      HR. IMPLICATIONS: Compared with no pretreatment before the IV induction of
      general anesthesia, the peak increase in blood pressure after laryngoscopy and
      tracheal intubation is best blunted by the combination of nicardipine and
      esmolol, compared with either drug alone. No single drug or combination in the
      doses tested opposed increased heart rate.

TI  - Comparative study of ACE-inhibition, angiotensin II antagonism, and calcium
      channel blockade on flow-mediated vasodilation in patients with coronary disease 
      (BANFF study)
PG  - 60-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibition on brachial flow-mediated vasodilation. BACKGROUND: Quinapril, an ACE 
      inhibitor with high affinity, has been shown to improve coronary endothelial
      dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease. The effectiveness of
      different vasoactive agents to improve human endothelial function is unknown.
      METHODS: High resolution ultrasound was used to assess endothelium-dependent
      brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in patients with coronary
      disease. We studied 80 patients (mean age 58 +/- 0.9 years) in a partial-block,
      cross-over design trial. Patients were randomized to one of four different drug
      sequences to receive quinapril 20 mg, enalapril 10 mg, losartan 50 mg or
      amlodipine 5 mg daily. Each patient received three drugs with a two-week washout 
      period between treatments. The primary end point was the absolute difference in
      FMD after eight weeks of each study drug compared with their respective baselines
      analyzed in a blinded fashion. RESULTS: There was mild impairment of FMD at
      baseline (7.3 +/- 0.6%). The change in FMD from baseline was significant only for
      quinapril (1.8 +/- 1%, p < 0.02). No change was seen with losartan (0.8 +/- 1.1%,
      p = 0.57), amlodipine (0.3 +/- 0.9%, p = 0.97) or enalapril (-0.2 +/- 0.8%, p =
      0.84). No significant change in nitroglycerin-induced dilation occurred with drug
      therapy. The improvement in quinapril response was not seen in those with the DD 
      ACE genotype (0.5 +/- 2.1%) but was seen in those with the ID and II genotype
      (3.3 +/- 1.2 and 3.2 +/- 1.9%, respectively, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Only
      quinapril was associated with significant improvement in FMD, and this response
      is related to the presence of the insertion allele of the ACE genotype.

TI  - Use of calcium-channel blockers in pediatric renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 288-92
AB  - Hypertension (HTN) is a significant problem in pediatric renal transplant (TP)
      recipients, predisposing the individuals to the development of cardiovascular
      disease and graft dysfunction. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are considered
      excellent agents to treat post-TP HTN. We compared the efficacy and adverse
      effects of the two most commonly prescribed CCBs in our pediatric renal TP
      population: nifedipine (Procardia, or P) and amlodipine (Norvasc, or N). All
      patients (n = 24) had been started on a CCB for systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic
      BP (DBP) > 95%. There were no other changes in adjunctive antihypertensive
      medications or doses during the cross-over period. Post-TP, pretreatment (pretx) 
      SBP was 137.6 +/- 10.9 mmHg. The post-treatment SBP were (in mmHg): 128.5 +/-
      11.9 (all patients, n = 24) (p = 0.009 vs. pretx); 126.4 +/- 10.0 (P alone, n =
      15) (p = 0.007 vs. pretx); 132.8 +/- 14.4 (P + other antihypertensive(s), n = 9) 
      (p = 0.331, NS vs. pretx). The post-TP, pretreatment DBP was 88.2 +/- 11.1 mmHg. 
      The post-treatment DBP were (in mmHg): 78.5 +/- 6.9 (all patients, n = 24) (p =
      0.03 vs. pretx); 77.2 +/- 7.4 (P alone, n = 15) (p = 0.008 vs. pretx); 80.7 +/-
      6.1 (P + other antihypertensive(s), n = 9) (p = 0.063, NS vs. pretx). P and N
      were equally effective in reducing SBP (p = 0.843, NS) and DBP (p = 0.612, NS).
      Cyclosporin A (CyA) dose (p = 0.81) and trough levels (p = 0.19) were similar in 
      P- and N-treated patients. Calculated GFR was virtually identical in P- and
      N-treated patients (p = 0.89). Patients (or parents of) reported a higher
      incidence of various side-effects while receiving P, including headache,
      flushing, dizziness and leg cramps. Furthermore, 22/24 (91.7%) reported some
      degree of gingival hyperplasia during treatment with P, and all these patients
      reported a stabilization or reduction of hypertrophy after the switch from P to
      N. We conclude that CCBs (N) are efficacious drugs for the purpose of BP control 
      and renal protection in pediatric renal TP recipients.

TI  - Nifedipine versus ritodrine for suppression of preterm labor; a meta-analysis.
PG  - 783-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since large randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of
      nifedipine and ritodrine in the suppression of preterm labor are lacking, we
      performed a meta-analysis on the subject. METHODS: We searched the databases
      Medline and EMBASE using the keywords 'nifedipine', 'ritodrine' and 'randomized' 
      or 'randomised'. The studies were scored for blinding, method of randomization
      and type of analysis ('intention-to-treat' versus 'par protocol'). Subsequently, 
      two by two tables were constructed using 'delay of labor by 48 hours or more',
      'delay of labor beyond 36 weeks gestation', perinatal mortality, respiratory
      distress syndrome and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit as end points. 
      Homogeneity between the studies was tested with a Breslow-Day test. Pooled odds
      ratios were calculated in case homogeneity could not be rejected. RESULTS: We
      could detect ten studies that were published between 1986 and 1998, incorporating
      data of 681 patients. Nifedipine reduced the risk of delivery within 48 hours
      compared to ritodrine, but this difference was not statistically significant
      (odds ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 1.1). Nifedipine also reduced
      the risk of delivery before 36 weeks compared to ritodrine, and this difference
      was statistically significant (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to
      0.90). We are not aware of studies reporting on long-term outcome. CONCLUSION:
      Since studies reporting on long-term outcome are lacking, the choice between
      nifedipine and ritodrine can only be based on obstetrical and short-term neonatal
      outcomes. From that perspective, nifedipine should be the drug of first choice
      for the suppression of preterm labor.

TI  - Comparison of intravenous metoprolol, verapamil and diltiazem on the attenuation 
      of haemodynamic changes associated with tracheal extubation.
PG  - 462-7
AB  - Changes in heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure were measured 
      after extubation in 60 ASA Grade I and II patients to assess the effects of
      diltiazem (0.2 mg kg-1), verapamil (0.05 mg kg-1) and metoprolol (0.02 mg kg-1)
      given as a bolus 2 min before tracheal extubation. All the haemodynamic variables
      measured increased significantly after extubation in the control and diltiazem
      groups when compared with the base-line recordings (P < 0.05). Metoprolol
      effectively blocked the increases in heart rate after extubation and the increase
      in blood pressure in this group was less when compared with the control group (P 
      < 0.05). Verapamil alleviated the increase in both heart rate and blood pressure.
      However, profound hypotension and bradycardia requiring therapy, occurred in the 
      verapamil group. For this reason, careful observation is necessary when using
      verapamil and the routine use of this drug in patients with coronary artery
      disease requires further studies.

TI  - Efficacy of amlodipine in pediatric patients with hypertension.
PG  - 304-10
AB  - We designed a study to determine the efficacy and safety of amlodipine given once
      daily in the pediatric population. Twenty-one patients (mean age 13.1 years) with
      either essential (n=160) or renal (n=5) hypertension, and newly diagnosed (n=15) 
      or poorly controlled or intolerant on existing antihypertensive therapy (n=6),
      were included. Patients received amlodipine once daily at a starting mean dose of
      0.07+/-0.04 mg/kg per day. The total daily dose of amlodipine was increased
      25%-50% every 5-7 days if the mean home blood pressure measurements (HBPM) were
      above the 95th percentile for age and gender. A baseline followed by a repeat
      24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitor study (ABPM) was performed in 20 patients 
      when the mean HBPM was below the 95th percentile goal. The mean titrated dose
      required to control BP was 0.29+/-0.11 mg/kg per day for those < 13 years,
      0.16+/-0.11 mg/kg per day for those > or = 13 years, 0.23+/-0.14 mg/kg per day
      for essential, hypertension and 0.24+/-0.13 mg/kg per day for renal hypertension.
      The ABPM demonstrated that amlodipine provided effective BP control as primary
      therapy in 14 essential patients. Adverse effects included fatigue (n=6),
      headache (n=5), facial flushing (n=4), dizziness (n=3), edema (n=3), abdominal
      pain (n=3), chest pain (n=2), nausea (n=1), and vomiting (n=1). Quality of life
      appeared to improve during therapy. Amlodipine was an effective once daily
      antihypertensive agent with an acceptable safety profile. Higher doses of
      amlodipine were required for younger patients, and monotherapy was effective in
      patients with essential hypertension.

TI  - Fixed-dose combination vs monotherapy in hypertension: a meta-analysis
      evaluation.
PG  - 477-83
AB  - Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive therapy has received interest since the
      publication of the JNC-VI report. Relatively few head-to-head comparative studies
      between fixed-dose combinations and first-line monotherapies for hypertension
      have been published. The objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis
      of various first-line monotherapies and the fixed-dose combination of
      amlodipine/benazepril. The results of the meta-analysis were used to compare the 
      efficacy and safety of the first-line monotherapies with amlodipine/benazepril.
      The meta-analysis included 82 studies that included 110 treatment groups
      (cohorts). The study compared nine different monotherapies and one combination
      therapy (amlodipine/benazepril). Of the 82 studies, 22 were placebo-controlled
      and 60 were active treatment controlled. The mean absolute decrease in supine
      diastolic blood pressure (BP) ranged from 9.7 to 13.3 mm Hg with verapamil
      showing the greatest effect and captopril the least (13.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg; 9.7 +/- 
      2.9 mm Hg, respectively). When studies were weighted by sample size, atenolol,
      verapamil, lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest BP effect.
      When studies were weighted by variance, amlodipine/benazepril and atenolol showed
      the greatest BP effect. The percentage of patients controlled on therapy ranged
      from 54% to 79%. Lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest percent
      controlled. The overall incidence of adverse effects ranged from 12.1% to 41.8%
      with lisinopril having the lowest and nifedipine having the highest incidence.
      The overall incidence of adverse effects resulting in drug discontinuance ranged 
      from 1.3% to 10.7%, with amlodipine/benazepril having the lowest and nifedipine
      having the highest incidence. The results of the meta-analysis indicate that
      amlodipine/benazepril produces above average reductions in BP with a lower than
      average incidence of overall side effects and the lowest incidence of adverse
      effects resulting in drug discontinuance. The fixed-dose combination of
      amlodipine/benazepril achieves its goal of effective BP lowering with a minimum
      of significant side effects.

TI  - Comparison between isosorbide dinitrate aerosol and nifedipine in the treatment
      of hypertensive emergencies.
PG  - 473-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide donors have been used in the management of hypertensive 
      emergencies (HE). Isosorbide dinitrate aerosol (ISA) is a nitric oxide
      fast-acting donor. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of ISA and
      nifedipine in the treatment of HE. METHODS: Sixty adult patients with an HE were 
      randomised to receive either ISA (2.5 mg) or nifedipine (10 mg). Patients were
      given an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately prior, and 30 min after
      administering the medication. Blood pressure (BP) was measured every 5 min for
      the first 30 min, and then every 30 min for a period of 6 h. RESULTS: Blood
      pressure values for all patients in the ISA group decreased significantly (187
      +/- 13/121 +/- 6 to 153 +/- 15/92.3 +/- 7.6 mmHg, P < 0.005). Two of the patients
      in this group had angor pectoris with evidence of subepicardial ischaemia as seen
      in the first ECG, both of which disappeared with the drug. Heart rate decreased
      by 14%. Similarly, all patients in the nifedipine group had significant decreases
      in BP (190 +/- 23/115 +/- 7 to 153 +/- 26/86 +/- 6 mm Hg, P < 0.005). Their first
      ECG was normal. Two patients suffered angor pectoris after nifedipine, with
      subepicardial ischaemia registering in the second ECG. Heart rate increased 11.9%
      in this group. During the follow-up period, no clinically significant side
      effects or cases of rebound hypertension were observed in the ISA group, whereas 
      in the nifedipine group, eight patients reported having headaches and four others
      rebound hypertension. CONCLUSION: Our results show a favourable effect of ISA in 
      the treatment of HE.

TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of therapies for premature labour.
PG  - 35-56
AB  - Prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, yet the
      incidence of preterm birth has not declined despite the use of multiple
      pharmacological agents to treat preterm labour. After reviewing the literature we
      conclude the following. beta-Agonists have been shown to prolong gestation for 24
      to 48 hours; however, these agents have not been shown to decrease neonatal
      morbidity or mortality. Adverse effects are inevitable and can be
      life-threatening. There are no proven benefits to mother or fetus with long term 
      therapy. More data are needed regarding the tolerability and efficacy of calcium 
      antagonists before routine clinical use can be recommended. Oxytocin antagonists 
      should be considered investigational drugs and further studies are needed to
      evaluate their effectiveness in the treatment of preterm labour. Furthermore, the
      tolerability of oxytocin antagonists in both mother and fetus has not been
      adequately established. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, has been shown
      to delay delivery in a limited number of randomised placebo-controlled clinical
      trials. Sulindac appears promising but has never been evaluated in a well
      controlled trial. Neonatal adverse effects appear to be minimal with
      prostaglandin inhibitors as long as the duration of treatment is short (<48 to 72
      hours) and the gestational age is <32 weeks. Magnesium sulfate appears to inhibit
      myometrial contractility but is ineffective at prolonging gestation or preventing
      preterm birth. Furthermore, magnesium has not been shown to decrease neonatal
      morbidity or mortality; in fact, some investigators have shown an increase in
      infant mortality with this agent. There are no data to support adjunctive
      antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of preterm labour. Oral maintenance
      therapy with any of these tocolytic agents has not been shown to decrease the
      rate of preterm birth or recurrent preterm labour.

TI  - [Medicamentous prevention after electric cardioversion of chronic atrial
      fibrillation. Goals and design of the PAFAC Study].
PG  - 195-207
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia. However,
      despite manifold publications reflecting numerous clinical trials about treatment
      of AF, the management of this arrhythmia is still under controversial discussion,
      in daily clinical work as well as in research. The present study concentrates on 
      three major questions: 1. How frequent are recurrences of AF in long-term
      follow-up? Most of the previous studies used the occurrence of symptoms as a
      surrogate parameter for recurrences of AF, despite the expected high rate of
      asymptomatic relapses. In the present study a daily transtelephonic ECG
      transmission enables a rhythm monitoring independent of symptoms. 2. Is the
      frequency of AF recurrences significantly reduced by antiarrhythmic medication? A
      direct comparison of class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs, which still are most
      frequently used for this indication, and of placebo will answer this question. 3.
      How safe is the long-term treatment for the prevention of AF recurrences with
      special respect to proarrhythmic effects? The daily transtelephonic ECG
      transmission enables a quantitative and qualitative monitoring of tachy- and
      bradyarrhythmias independent of symptoms. Additionally, the daily analysis of ECG
      measures may detect parameters predicting subsequent life threatening
      arrhythmias. The study design provides a prospective, randomised, double-blind,
      placebo controlled, multicenter parallel group comparison. In Germany and in the 
      Czech Republic about 90 hospitals will include 900 patients with documented
      chronic AF, age 18 to 80 years, if they are eligible for electrical cardioversion
      without concomitant antiarrhythmic drug therapy and if they are anticoagulated
      for at least three weeks prior to inclusion. Neither the size of the left atrium 
      nor the duration of chronic AF are exclusion criteria. A few hours after
      successful electrical cardioversion the patients are randomised either to sotalol
      (2 x 160 mg) or quinidine + verapamil (3 x 160 mg + 3 x 80 mg) or placebo.
      Starting at the day after cardioversion, the patient is asked to record and
      transmit electrocardiograms of one minute duration at least once a day using his 
      personal transtelephonic ECG recording unit (Tele-ECG recorder, credit card
      size), in case of symptoms as often as necessary. The ECGs can be transmitted at 
      any time by any regular phone without additional equipment using a toll free
      number. A custom made, computer based, fully automated receiving centre is
      handling the patient calls interactively with voice control, including a voice
      recording of the patient's symptoms. The ECG tracings and the patient's voice
      messages are subsequently computer based analysed by experienced technicians. All
      ECG measures are stored in a database. In case of AF recurrence, any other
      relevant arrhythmia or additional abnormalities (e.g. QT prolongation) the
      correspondent hospital is immediately informed by fax. In case of AF recurrence, 
      a subsequent Holter recording discriminates in paroxysmal and permanent AF. Study
      medication is ended if either permanent AF or the third episode of paroxysmal AF 
      are detected or after 12 months of follow-up. Regular follow-up visits are
      performed monthly. Major endpoints are the time to first recurrence of AF or the 
      time to death, secondary parameters are the number of AF recurrences, the time to
      end of medication and AF related symptoms. The recruitment started in the last
      days of 1996. Until the end of June 1998, 424 patients have been randomised. It
      is expected to end recruitment in spring 1999 and to close the study in spring
      2000. Final results will be available in summer 2000.

AB  - This study compared the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a
      combination tablet containing the vascular-selective calcium antagonist
      felodipine and the beta1-selective adrenergic antagonist metoprolol, with a
      combination tablet of captopril-hydrochlorothiazide in a randomized, double-blind
      trial involving 109 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After 2 weeks on
      placebo, patients with a supine diastolic blood pressure of 95-115 mm Hg were
      randomized to felodipine-metoprolol, 5/50 mg o.d. (Logimax) or
      captopril-hydrochlorothiazide, 25/25 mg o.d. (Capozide). After a further 4 weeks,
      there was a mandatory dose increase to felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg o.d., and 
      captopril-hydrochlorothiazide, 50/25 mg o.d., and treatment then continued for a 
      another 4 weeks. At the end of the study, felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine
      blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide. The mean
      differences in change in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure between
      treatments after 8 weeks were 5.2 and 3.4 mm Hg, respectively, in favour of
      felodipine-metoprolol (p<0.05). Standing blood pressure also showed trends in
      favour of felodipine-metoprolol. The proportion of responders was similar in both
      groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. Two patients treated with
      felodipine-metoprolol and 5 with captopril-hydrochlorothiazide discontinued
      treatment due to adverse events. Felodipine-metoprolol combination reduced supine
      blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide with
      maintained tolerability.

TI  - Antiischemic effects of nicardipine and nitroglycerin after coronary artery
      bypass grafting.
PG  - 417-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the efficacy of a continuous infusion of nicardipine and 
      nitroglycerin in reducing the incidence and severity of perioperative myocardial 
      ischemia during elective coronary artery bypass grafting procedures in a
      prospective, randomized, controlled study. METHODS: Patients received either
      nicardipine infusion (0.7 to 1.4 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1); n = 30) or
      nitroglycerin (0.5 to 1 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1); n = 30) or neither medication 
      (n = 17) after aortic occlusion clamp release and for 24 hours postoperatively.
      Myocardial ischemic episodes (MIE) were considered to have occurred with
      ST-segment depressions or elevations of at least 1 mm and at least 2 mm (for both
      depressions or elevations), each at J + 60 ms and lasting at least 1 minute,
      using a two-channel Holter monitor. RESULTS: Only nicardipine significantly
      decreased the duration (p = 0.02) of the 1-mm or greater minutes per hour (3.2
      +/- 1.2 minutes per hour) and eliminated the number (p = 0.02) of the 2-mm or
      greater minutes per hour (zero minutes per hour) when compared with control
      patients (17.2 +/- 5.6 minutes per hour and 0.17 minutes per hour, respectively) 
      during the intraoperative postbypass period. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest
      that nicardipine lessened the severity of myocardial ischemia shortly after
      coronary revascularization and could be considered as an alternative to standard 
      antiischemic therapy.

TI  - Low-dose combination treatment for hypertension versus single-drug
      treatment-bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide versus amlodipine, enalapril, and
      placebo: combined analysis of comparative studies.
PG  - 313-21
AB  - To assess the efficacy and safety of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg bisoprolol/6. 25 mg
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 2.5, 5, and 10 mg amlodipine; and 5, 10, 20, and 40
      mg enalapril in subjects (n = 541) with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95 
      to 114 mm Hg, data from two comparative studies were pooled. All drugs were
      titrated to a diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or less. Both studies were
      double-blind, randomized, parallel dose escalation trials with similar designs
      and included three active treatments. The second study also had a placebo group. 
      The mean change from baseline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure for
      placebo (n = 79) was -0. 1/-2.2 mm Hg; amlodipine (n = 154), -12.4/-10.3 mm Hg;
      enalapril (n = 155), -9.4/-8.2 mm Hg; and bisoprolol/HCTZ (n = 155), -14.0/-12.0.
      Overall efficacy analyses documented a statistically significant decrease in
      sitting diastolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with
      placebo, amlodipine, and enalapril. There was a significant reduction in sitting 
      systolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with placebo and
      enalapril but not amlodipine. Also, there was a significant decrease in sitting
      heart rate for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ (-6.2 beats/min) compared with placebo
      (+0.1 beats/min), amlodipine (+1.2 beats/min), and enalapril (+0.5 beats/min).
      The control rate (diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) for bisoprolol/6.25
      mg HCTZ (66.5%) was significantly better than for placebo (21.8%) and enalapril
      (47.1%) but not amlodipine (58.4%). Of those patients achieving and maintaining
      control, 49% of the bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ subjects were on the lowest two doses
      compared with 30% of the amlodipine and 26% of the enalapril subjects.
      Percentages of patients reporting at least one drug-related adverse event through
      week 12 were 27%, 24%, 28%, and 25% for placebo, bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ,
      amlodipine, and enalapril (not significant). Lower doses of two drugs in fixed
      combination can provide as good or better blood pressure control compared with
      higher doses of a single drug with similar tolerability and safety.

TI  - Antihypertensive monotherapy with nisoldipine CC is superior to enalapril in
      black patients with severe hypertension.
PG  - 194-203
AB  - A single-center, prospective double-blind randomized trial was conducted to
      compare the efficacy and safety of the calcium channel blocker nisoldipine in a
      sustained release coat-core formulation (CC), titrated from 10 mg to 40 mg daily,
      with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, titrated from 10 to
      40 mg daily, in the treatment of black South African patients with severe
      hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] between 115 and 140 mm Hg,
      confirmed by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring). Treatment target was a
      sitting DBP < 95 mm Hg by the 9th week of treatment. This was followed by a
      4-month open phase using nisoldipine CC 10 to 60 mg daily. Ninety-six patients
      had complete data at baseline, and at the end of the double-blind and open
      phases, and were included in this analysis. In both groups, all patients required
      titration up to the maximal dose of double-blind medication. Monotherapy with
      nisoldipine CC, but not enalapril, significantly reduced both sitting and 24-h
      ambulatory blood pressure (BP). Twenty-four-hour BP in the nisoldipine CC group
      decreased from 179+/-14 / 118+/-7 to 144+/-16 / 94+/-10 mm Hg (P < .0001) versus 
      181+/-13 / 117+/-5 to 171+/-17 / 110+/-11 mm Hg in the enalapril group (P = ns). 
      The profound decrease in blood pressure achieved with nisoldipine CC was
      accompanied by a significant reduction in left ventricular [LV] mass index,
      observed after only 2 months of treatment (from 146+/-40 to 129+/-35 g/m2, P =
      .05). In contrast, enalapril had no effect on LV mass (from 139+/-36 to 142+/-50 
      g/m2, P = NS). The antihypertensive effect of nisoldipine CC was further
      demonstrated in the open phase, during which 24-h BP decreased from 180+/-14 /
      118+/-6 mm Hg (at baseline) to 142+/-16 / 92+/-10 mm Hg at the end of the 16-week
      open phase (P < .0001). This effect was sustained with trough-to-peak ratio of
      74% for systolic and 67% for diastolic BP, with further regression in LV mass.
      Reduction in 24-h systolic BP to < 135 mm Hg was associated with a greater degree
      of regression of LV mass index in patients treated with nisoldipine CC. The
      incidence of adverse events in both groups was low and both nisoldipine CC and
      enalapril were well tolerated. The incidence of significant ventricular
      arrhythmia was also low and did not change with treatment. In conclusion, our
      findings suggest that nisoldipine CC administered once daily could be considered 
      as a suitable first-line antihypertensive agent in black patients with severe
      hypertension, based on its profound and sustained blood-pressure-lowering effect,
      associated with significant regression of left ventricular mass and its low side 
      effect profile.

      and lipoprotein profiles in men with hypertension. Department of Veterans Affairs
      Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents.
PG  - 551-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concern based on the reported short-term adverse effects of
      antihypertensive agents on plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles (PLPPs) has
      complicated the therapy for hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term
      (1-year) effects of 6 different antihypertensive drugs and placebo on PLPPs in a 
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial in 15 US
      Veterans Affairs medical centers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1292
      ambulatory men, 21 years or older, with diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) ranging 
      from 95 to 109 mm Hg taking placebo were randomized to receive placebo or 1 of 6 
      antihypertensive drugs: hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine,
      diltiazem, or prazosin. After drug titration, patients with a DBP of less than 90
      mm Hg were followed up for 1 year. Plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles were
      determined at baseline, after initial titration, and at 1 year. RESULTS: After 8 
      weeks on a regimen of hydrochlorothiazide, increases of 3.3 mg/dL (0.09 mmol/L)
      in total cholesterol and 2.7 mg/dL in apolipoprotein B were significantly
      different (P< or =.05) from decreases of 9.3 mg/dL in total cholesterol and 5.4
      mg/dL in ApoB levels while receiving prazosin but not from placebo. Patients
      achieving positive DBP control using hydrochlorothiazide (responders) showed no
      adverse changes in PLPPs, whereas nonresponders exhibited increases in
      triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
      Plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles did not change significantly among
      treatment groups after 1 year except for minor decreases in high-density
      lipoprotein 2 levels using hydrochlorothiazide, clonidine, and atenolol.
      CONCLUSIONS: None of these 6 antihypertensive drugs has any long-term adverse
      effects on PLPPs and, therefore, may be safely prescribed. Previously reported
      short-term adverse effects from using hydrochlorothiazide are limited to
      nonresponders.

TI  - Long-acting lacidipine versus short-acting nifedipine in the treatment of
      asymptomatic acute blood pressure increase.
PG  - 479-84
AB  - We compared antihypertensive efficacy and safety of a single administration of
      equipotent doses of lacidipine versus nifedipine in the hypertensive urgencies.
      Twenty-nine asymptomatic essential hypertensive patients (nine men, 20 women)
      with a mean age of 55.03+/-11.19 years and baseline diastolic blood pressure
      (DBP) of > or =120 mm Hg after resting 30 min, not taking antihypertensive drugs 
      for the last 24 h, were randomized in a single-blind fashion to receive
      lacidipine, 4 mg (LCD, 15 patients) or short-acting nifedipine, 20 mg (NFD, 14
      patients) in a single dose. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were taken
      every 30 min during the first 8 h and every 2 h until 24 h of follow-up. Baseline
      BP values were similar in the two groups (LCD, 222.5+/-32.8/124.6+/-8.4 mm Hg vs.
      NFD, 215.9+/-20.6/128+/-7.7 mm Hg; p = NS). Both drugs promoted a significant
      reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP; 169.6+/-27.8 vs. 170.6+/-25.3 mm Hg)
      and diastolic blood pressure (DBP; 104.1+/-16 vs. 102.9+/-12.4 mm Hg) after 8 h. 
      However, either SBP (165+/-27.3 vs. 190.6+/-18.2 mm Hg; p = 0.008) and DBP
      (99.9+/-12.3 vs. 117.2+/-11.4 mm Hg; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the 
      NFD group after 24-h dosing. Eleven patients in the LCD group had a decrease in
      BP >25% of the baseline value both 8 and 24 h after the dose. Although 10
      patients showed the same response in the NFD group 8 h after the dose, only four 
      patients maintained these values at 24 h. One patient treated with NFD had a
      transient cerebrovascular ischemic attack. No adverse effects were observed in
      the LCD group. We conclude that the long-acting calcium antagonist lacidipine was
      more effective than the short-acting nifedipine in both controlling BP and
      maintaining this BP reduction over 8 h in essential hypertensive patients with
      acute asymptomatic BP increase.

TI  - Preterm labor.
PG  - 593-602
AB  - Preterm labor is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in the
      United States. It is characterized by cervical effacement and/or dilatation and
      increased uterine irritability before 37 weeks of gestation. Women with a history
      of preterm labor are at greatest risk. Strategies for reducing the incidence of
      preterm labor and delivery have focused on educating both physicians and patients
      about the risks for preterm labor and methods of detecting preterm cervical
      dilatation. Methods used to predict preterm labor include weekly cervical
      assessment, transvaginal ultrasonography, detection of fetal fibronectin and home
      uterine activity monitoring. As yet, it is unclear if any of these strategies
      should be routinely employed. At present, management of preterm labor may include
      the use of tocolytic agents, corticosteroids and antibiotics.

PG  - 69-73
AB  - A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group comparison of nifedipine 
      GITS 20 mg (Adalat LA) once daily and bendrofluazide 2.5 mg once daily in
      patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension was conducted. Two hundred patients
      with a diastolic blood pressure (BP) in the range 95 to 109 mm Hg were randomised
      to active treatment for 6 weeks. For the per-protocol efficacy population, both
      treatments resulted in clinically significant mean reductions of trough diastolic
      BP (nifedipine GITS -8.9 mm Hg, bendrofluazide -7.9 mm Hg) and systolic BP
      (nifedipine GITS -10.4 mm Hg, bendrofluazide -10.5 mm Hg). The study demonstrated
      that nifedipine GITS was 'at least equivalent' to bendrofluazide in the reduction
      of trough diastolic BP (one-sided upper 95% confidence limit, 0.5 mm Hg), where
      inequivalence had been pre-defined as a difference in mean diastolic BP of > or
      =5 mm Hg. Both drugs were well tolerated, the overall incidence of adverse events
      in the nifedipine GITS treatment group being 34.0% (34/100) and in the
      bendrofluazide treatment group being 29.0% (29/100). The commonest events
      (incidence > or =5%) were headache, constipation, 'flu syndrome and
      vasodilatation with nifedipine GITS and headache and nausea with bendrofluazide. 
      An increased incidence of elevations of plasma urea and glucose was observed in
      patients treated with bendrofluazide (9.6% and 30.4% respectively) compared to
      those treated with nifedipine GITS (3.1% and 18.8% respectively). Nifedipine GITS
      20 mg once daily is 'at least equivalent' to bendrofluazide 2.5 mg once daily in 
      reduction of blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.

TI  - Verapamil SR/trandolapril combination therapy for the elderly hypertensive
      patient. German VeraTran Hypertension Study Group.
PG  - 61-7
AB  - A total of 254 elderly hypertensive patients (71 men and 183 women aged between
      63 and 92 years, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 95-115 mm Hg inclusive) were
      treated with the fixed combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril following a
      4-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Treatment was started with a response 
      dependent 3-step dose titration period. All patients were initiated at dose step 
      1 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 120/0.5 mg o.d.) and if not normalised (DBP <90 mm
      Hg) titrated at 4-weekly intervals over dose step 2 (verapamil SR/trandolapril
      180/1 mg o.d.) to dose step 3 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg o.d.) during
      the first 12 weeks. After 3 months of treatment all patients not normalised were 
      excluded from further participation in the study. The total duration of the
      treatment period was 6 months. Routine safety investigations were performed
      prior, during and on completion of the treatment period. Verapamil
      SR/trandolapril was highly effective in reducing blood pressure. At individual
      last visit during active treatment (also taking the non-responders into account),
      the mean reduction in SBP/DBP was 21.9/17.1 mm Hg (95% CI 19.8-24.1/16.1-18.1 mm 
      Hg), with most of this reduction occurring during the first 3 months of
      treatment. After 6 months, 81.9% of the patients enrolled showed normalisation of
      DBP (<90 mm Hg) and 85% were responders (normalisation and/or reduction in DBP by
      at least 10 mm Hg). Normalisation and responder rates appeared to be comparable
      when stratified by age subgroups (63-69, 70-79 and > or =80 years) and were all
      greater than 80%. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was very well tolerated and there was
      no evidence of any clinically relevant changes in routine laboratory safety
      variables or resting ECG. In conclusion, the fixed dose combination of verapamil 
      SR/trandolapril is an effective and safe alternative treatment for the elderly
      hypertensive patient.

TI  - Improved tolerability of felodipine compared with amlodipine in elderly
      hypertensives: a randomised, double-blind study in 535 patients, focusing on
      vasodilatory adverse events. The International Study Group.
PG  - 381-6
AB  - The primary aim of this double-blind, parallel group trial was to compare
      incidence of newly occurring vasodilatory adverse events in elderly patients
      treated with recommended once-daily doses of felodipine extended release (ER) or 
      amlodipine. A total of 535 patients over 65 years old with a sitting diastolic
      blood pressure of 90-115 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure 160-220 mmHg, were
      recruited at 46 centres worldwide. Patients were randomised to felodipine ER 2.5 
      mg or amlodipine 5 mg. If blood pressure was > 160/90 mmHg after three or six
      weeks, felodipine ER was increased to 5 and 10 mg and amlodipine to 10 mg. After 
      nine weeks, average doses of felodipine ER and amlodipine were 5.5 mg and 7.3 mg,
      respectively. Newly occurring vasodilatory adverse events were reported by 32% of
      felodipine ER patients and 43% of amlodipine patients (p = 0.007). Both
      treatments effectively reduced blood pressure 24 hours post-dose. Using a low
      starting dose and individual titration, felodipine ER achieves good control of
      blood pressure with few vasodilatory side-effects.

TI  - Divergent effects of ACE-inhibition and calcium channel blockade on NO-activity
      in systemic and renal circulation in essential hypertension.
PG  - 402-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nitric oxide is a vasodilating and blood pressure lowering substance. 
      To investigate whether calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors increase vascular nitric oxide activity, we assessed systemic and
      renal vascular sensitivity to nitric oxide synthase inhibition in hypertensives
      on and off medication. METHODS: Ten essential hypertensive patients, aged 22-51
      years, were studied 3 times: > or = 4 weeks off medication, after 3 weeks
      treatment with enalapril 20 mg twice a day and after 3 weeks nifedipine 60
      mg/day. Each time, 24-h blood pressure registration was performed, followed by a 
      clearance study to obtain a 3-h dose-response curve for intravenously infused
      NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, respectively 0.75, 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/h).
      RESULTS: L-NMMA dose-dependently increased mean arterial pressure with 5 +/- 2
      mmHg and systemic vascular resistance with 24 +/- 5% at maximum dose, whereas
      cardiac output decreased (all P < 0.001). Enalapril and nifedipine treatment
      decreased blood pressure, while the L-NMMA-induced increase in systemic vascular 
      resistance was potentiated (enalapril: 45 +/- 7% and nifedipine: 46 +/- 8%; both 
      P < 0.01). L-NMMA also dose-dependently decreased renal blood flow by 58 +/- 8%
      at maximum dose (P < 0.001), but neither drug potentiated these effects.
      CONCLUSION: These results indicate that, in essential hypertensives,
      antihypertensive therapy with enalapril or nifedipine increases nitric oxide
      dependency of systemic vascular tone, which may play a role in the blood pressure
      lowering effect of these drugs. However, this phenomenon cannot be observed in
      the renal circulation, suggesting a different regulation of endothelium-dependent
      vasomotion in the hypertensive kidney.

TI  - Study population and treatment titration in the International Nifedipine GITS
      Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT).
PG  - 2113-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the baseline characteristics of the high-risk
      hypertensive patients entering the International Nifedipine GITS Study:
      Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT). To determine the
      success of single and combination therapy in achieving target blood pressures in 
      such a population. DESIGN: INSIGHT is a double-blind, prospective outcome trial
      comparing the efficacy of the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine GITS, and the
      thiazide, co-amilozide, in preventing myocardial infarction and stroke. We
      recruited 2996 men and 3454 women, aged 55-80 years, with blood pressure during
      placebo run-in >150/95 mmHg or isolated systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg from
      nine countries. Treatment allocation to nifedipine GITS 30 mg daily or
      co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/amiloride 5 mg) once daily was performed 
      by minimization rather than randomization to balance additional risk factors.
      This was followed by four optional increases in treatment: dose-doubling of the
      primary drug, addition of atenolol 25/50 mg or enalapril 5/10 mg, and then any
      other hypotensive drug excluding calcium blockers or diuretics. Target blood
      pressure was 140/90 mmHg or a fall > or = 20/10 mmHg. RESULTS: Blood pressure at 
      randomization was 172+/-15 / 99+/-9 mmHg. Thirteen per cent of the patients were 
      previously untreated. The proportions of each additional risk factors were:
      smoking > 10/day, 29%; cholesterol > 6.43 mmol/l, 52%; family history of
      premature myocardial infarction or stroke, 21%; diabetes mellitus 20%; left
      ventricular hypertrophy, 10%; previous myocardial infarction, other presentations
      of coronary heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease, each 6%; proteinuria,
      3%. Fifty-five per cent of patients had one additional risk factor, whereas 33%, 
      9% and 3% had two, three or more additional risk factors, respectively. The blood
      pressure (and falls in blood pressure) at the end of titration and at 1 year
      after minimization was 139+/-12 / 82+/-7 mmHg (33+/-15 / 17+/-9) in the 5226
      patients still on randomized treatment The numbers requiring the four treatment
      increments were, respectively, 1591, 780, 597 and 294, meaning that almost 70% of
      patients on randomized treatment in INSIGHT are receiving only the primary drug. 
      At one year, 69% of patients had a blood pressure < or = 140/90 mmHg. CONCLUSION:
      INSIGHT is one of the first double-blind comparisons of active antihypertensive
      treatments, requiring high-risk patients to achieve sufficient power. Despite
      this requirement, it is possible to achieve good blood pressure control in most
      patients without the addition of multiple additional treatments that may dilute
      any differences between the primary agents.

TI  - Isradipine in prediabetic hypertensive subjects.
PG  - 2103-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Investigators from the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis
      Study (MIDAS) previously reported that the isradipine group had a higher
      incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events than the diuretic group. The
      ultimate objective of the analyses presented here was to assess how indices of
      glycemia (specifically, serum glucose, serum insulin, and HbA1c) might have
      influenced the effects of the two agents on blood pressure control and CVD
      events. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria included men and women > 
      or = 40 years of age with ultrasonographically confirmed carotid atherosclerosis 
      and a diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mmHg. Although insulin-dependent diabetic 
      patients were excluded, the three glycemia indices had wide enough ranges to
      include patients who may be classified as prediabetic. A total of 883 patients
      were randomized either to the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (CA) isradipine 
      (2.5-5 mg twice a day) or to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg twice a
      day) and followed in double-blind fashion for 3 years. RESULTS: Both treatment
      groups had achieved comparable control of diastolic blood pressure, and there
      were no statistically significant differences in any of the glycemia indices,
      either at baseline or during follow-up. However, the excess isradipine events
      were noted to be clustered among those patients with elevated baseline levels of 
      HbA1c who also experienced greater blood pressure reductions during follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: The increased cardiovascular risk associated with dihydropyridine
      CAs in prediabetic patients may be an explanation for the overall CA debate.

TI  - A study of losartan, alone or with hydrochlorothiazide vs nifedipine GITS in
      elderly patients with diastolic hypertension.
PG  - 693-9
AB  - We conducted a randomised, double-blind, parallel design study comparing the
      efficacy and tolerability of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan,
      alone or with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to the dihydropyridine calcium 
      channel blocker, nifedipine GITS (gastro-intestinal therapeutic system), in
      elderly patients (> or =65 years old) with a diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
      between 95 and 115 mm Hg. After a placebo wash out period, 140 patients were
      randomly assigned to receive either losartan 50 mg or nifedipine GITS 30 mg.
      Patients were evaluated at 4-week intervals during a 12-week treatment period.
      Patients receiving losartan had HCTZ 12.5 mg added and increased to 25 mg to
      reduce DBP <90 mm Hg. Patients receiving nifedipine GITS had their dose increased
      to 60 mg and 90 mg to reduce DBP <90 mm Hg. Efficacy, tolerability and quality of
      life were assessed during the 12 weeks on each regimen. Patients treated with the
      losartan regimen (n = 73) had reductions in trough sitting DBP of -10, -13, and
      -13 mm Hg after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of therapy, respectively. Patients receiving
      the nifedipine GITS regimen (n = 67) had DBP reductions of -14, -15, and -15 mm
      Hg, respectively. There were no significant differences in the DBP response
      between the treatment groups except at week 4 (P < 0.05). Similar reductions in
      systolic BP (SBP) between the two treatment groups were observed at all time
      points. The percentages of patients in the two treatment groups reaching goal DBP
      (<90 mm Hg or DBP > or =90 mm Hg with a reduction from a baseline of > or =10 mm 
      Hg) were comparable (81% on the losartan regimen and 90% on the nifedipine GITS
      regimen). There were significantly more adverse events reported in patients
      receiving nifedipine GITS when compared to the losartan regimen (54% vs 36%, P < 
      0.05). A patient-reported symptom inventory also showed that swollen ankles was
      bothersome in significantly more patients treated with the nifedipine GITS
      regimen when compared to the losartan regimen (24% vs 5%, P = 0.001). Thus, in
      elderly patients with diastolic hypertension, a regimen of losartan alone or with
      HCTZ has similar efficacy to a regimen of nifedipine GITS with greater
      tolerability and less symptom bother due to swollen ankles.

TI  - Antihypertensive effect of amlodipine compared with nifedipine retard in patients
      with mild and moderate essential hypertension.
PG  - 281-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of amlodipine for hypertension treatment in comparison with nifedipine retard.
      METHODS: We examined 31 patients with arterial blood pressure approximately
      155-165 mmHg/100-105 mm Hg at the beginning of the trial. It was a randomized
      double-blind, parallel-group trial including two groups of patients. Patients of 
      the first group were given active amlodipine and nifedipine retard placebo during
      6 weeks, while the second group was given active nifedipine retard and amlodipine
      placebo. Statistical analysis was made using the paired Student's t-test,
      chi-square test and ANOVA test. RESULTS: At end point we observed significant
      decrease in arterial blood pressure after treatment of both drugs. The treatment 
      with nifedipine retard increased the mean heart rate of patients. Amlodipine
      therapy in comparison to nifedipine retard did not change the heart rate in
      treated patients. Safety parameters: SGOT, SGTP, creatinine and others were in
      laboratory norms ranges. CONCLUSION: Amlodipine proved to be an effective, more
      safe and better-tolerated therapeutical alternative for hypertension management
      than nifedipine retard.

TI  - Nimodipine monotherapy and carbamazepine augmentation in patients with refractory
      recurrent affective illness.
PG  - 404-13
AB  - Of 30 patients with treatment-refractory affective illness, 10 showed a moderate 
      to marked response to blind nimodipine monotherapy compared with placebo on the
      Clinical Global Impressions Scale. Fourteen inadequately responsive patients (3
      unipolar [UP], 11 bipolar [BP]) were treated with the blind addition of
      carbamazepine. Carbamazepine augmentation of nimodipine converted four (29%) of
      the partial responders to more robust responders. Patients who showed an
      excellent response to the nimodipine-carbamazepine combination included
      individual patients with patterns of rapid cycling, ultradian cycling, UP
      recurrent brief depression, and one with BP type II depression. When verapamil
      was blindly substituted for nimodipine, two BP patients failed to maintain
      improvement but responded again to nimodipine and remained well with a blind
      transition to another dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB),
      isradipine. Mechanistic implications of the response to the dihydropyridine
      L-type CCB nimodipine alone and in combination with carbamazepine are discussed.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in African
      American patients with hypertension. ISHIB Investigators Group. International
      Society on Hypertension in Blacks.
PG  - 2029-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a prevalent disease among African Americans, and
      successful treatment rates are low. Since calcium channel blockers are
      well-tolerated and efficacious in African Americans, we undertook this study to
      compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 3 commonly prescribed calcium
      channel blockers: amlodipine besylate (Norvasc), nifedipine coat core (CC)
      (Adalat CC), and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) (Procardia
      XL). METHODS: One hundred ninety-two hypertensive patients across 10 study
      centers were randomly assigned to double-blind monotherapy with amlodipine
      besylate (5 mg/d), nifedipine CC (30 mg/d), or nifedipine GITS (30 mg/d) for 8
      weeks. Patients not achieving therapeutic response after 4 weeks had their dose
      doubled for the next 4 weeks. The primary end point was a comparison of the
      average reduction (week 8 minus baseline) in 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP). Secondary end points included a comparison of average 24-hour
      ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP), office SBP or DBP reduction, responder 
      rates, safety, and tolerability. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-three patients were
      evaluable for efficacy after 8 weeks. There was no significant difference in the 
      average 24-hour ambulatory DBP (-8.5, -9.0, and -6.1 mm Hg, respectively) or SBP 
      (-14.3, -15.7, and -11.8 mm Hg, respectively) reduction. Average office SBP and
      DBP were reduced to a comparable degree (19-22 mm Hg [P =.50] and 12-14 mm Hg [P 
      =.51], respectively). Responder rates (DBP <90 or reduced by > or = 10 mm Hg)
      were similar (P = .38). Discontinuation rates and adverse event frequency were
      distributed similarly across the 3 treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The efficacy,
      safety, and tolerability of the 3 dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are
      equivalent in African Americans with stages 1 and 2 hypertension.

      tocolysis with oral diltiazem to oral nifedipine in achieving 37 weeks gestation.
      After successful intravenous tocolysis with magnesium sulfate, 69 women with
      preterm labor at <35 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to nifedipine (20 mg 
      orally every 4-6 hr), or diltiazem (30-60 mg orally every 4-6 hr). The primary
      outcome was the percentage of patients achieving 37 weeks gestation. Maternal
      cardiovascular alterations and neonatal outcomes were also assessed. Sixty-nine
      patients were available for final analysis. Less patients on diltiazem as
      compared to nifedipine achieved 37 weeks (15.1% vs. 41.7%, P = 0.019).
      Gestational age at delivery was also less for patients receiving diltiazem (35.5 
      +/- 3.5 weeks vs. 33.4 +/- 3.9 weeks, P = 0.022). There were fewer days gained in
      utero from randomization to delivery with diltiazem as compared to nifedipine;
      however, this difference was not statistically significant (22.4 +/- 16.3 days
      vs. 31.2 +/- 24.4 days, P = 0.084). Maternal blood pressure and pulse during
      tocolysis did not differ significantly between groups. Despite the theoretical
      advantages of diltiazem tocolysis, maintenance tocolysis with diltiazem offered
      no benefit over nifedipine in achieving 37 weeks gestation. The cardiovascular
      alterations with either drug in normotensive, pregnant patients appear minimal.

TI  - Constipation as an adverse effect of drug use in nursing home patients: an
      overestimated risk.
PG  - 255-61
AB  - AIMS: To investigate whether results from case control and cross sectional
      studies which suggest an association between laxative use and other drug use
      could be confirmed in a cohort study of nursing home patients. METHODS: A
      prospective cohort study of 2355 nursing home patients aged 65 years and over was
      performed to estimate the incidence relative risk of constipation associated with
      drug use. The study was conducted with prescription sequence analysis of each
      resident's detailed pharmacy records and data on morbidity and mobility. RESULTS:
      Use of drugs, which according to the summaries of product characteristics (SPC)
      and the literature on adverse drug effects have moderately to strongly
      constipating properties, was associated with a relative risk of 1.59 (95% CI
      1.24-2.04) for the occurrence of constipation during exposure time. Use of drugs 
      with mildly to moderately constipating effects was not associated with laxative
      use (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.93-1.38). Stratification on the level of age, gender, type
      of nursing (psychogeriatric or somatic), morbidity, number of medications taken
      and mobility showed no confounding effects of these variables on outcome
      measurements. These variables all acted as effect modifiers. Effect of age and
      number of medications taken on the relative risk was nonlinear. CONCLUSIONS:
      Although an association between drugs that exhibit moderately to strongly
      constipating effects and occurrence of constipation was found, the risk was not
      as high as seen in previous studies. The high prevalence of constipation in
      nursing home patients is only partly due to adverse drug effects.

TI  - Reduction of cardiovascular structural changes by nifedipine GITS in essential
      hypertensive patients.
PG  - 160-9
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the calcium antagonist
      Nifedipine GITS in a double-blind, randomized comparison with the diuretic
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on reduction of left ventricular (LV) mass and minimal
      vascular resistance in a group of essential hypertensives with left ventricular
      hypertrophy (LVH). The effects on blood pressure and on echocardiographic LV
      functional parameters were also analysed. After two months of randomized
      treatment with Nifedipine GITS or HCTZ, if diastolic blood pressure was > 90
      mmHg, a combination of the two drugs was given and was continued for 24 weeks.
      M-mode, 2D-guided echocardiography was used to measure LV mass index (LVMI)
      according to the "Penn convention". Minimal vascular resistance was measured in
      the forearm, from arterial pressure and maximal blood flow, using a strain gauge 
      plethysmography. All examinations were performed before and after 8 and 24 weeks 
      of treatment. Changes in LVMI were analysed at 8 weeks and at 24 weeks in
      patients receiving monotherapy ("according to protocol" analysis), and also at
      the end of treatment in patients taking Nifedipine or HCTZ monotherapy or the
      combination of the two drugs ("intention to treat" analysis). Both Nifedipine and
      HCTZ significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001),
      without any significant difference between the two drug treatments. Heart rate
      was not significantly modified by either treatment. A progressive decrease in
      LVMI was observed after 8 and 24 weeks of treatment with Nifedipine monotherapy
      (ANOVA, p = 0.03), while the decrease in LVMI during HCTZ treatment did not
      progress further at 24 weeks (ANOVA, p = 0.49). A significant reduction of
      minimal vascular resistance was observed in patients treated with Nifedipine GITS
      monotherapy (ANOVA, p = 0.001), but not in the HCTZ group (ANOVA, p = 0.06).
      Comparison of changes of forearm minimal vascular resistance, considering
      baseline values, could demonstrate a greater effect during Nifedipine monotherapy
      as compared to HCTZ monotherapy. In conclusion, in a group of hypertensive
      patients with LVH, treatment for 24 weeks with Nifedipine GITS alone or in
      combination with HCTZ induced a significant reduction in LVMI and of forearm
      vascular structural changes, as evaluated by minimal vascular resistance. The
      decrease of minimal vascular resistance was significantly greater in patients
      treated with Nifedipine monotherapy, as compared to those given HCTZ.

TI  - Comparison between the effects of amlodipine and lisinopril on proteinuria in
      nondiabetic renal failure: a double-blind, randomized prospective study.
PG  - 1074-9
AB  - Double-blind, randomized controlled studies of longer than 1 week in duration
      comparing the antiproteinuric potential of long-acting dihydropyridine calcium
      channel blockers with that of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are 
      lacking. Therefore, we performed such a study in patients with nondiabetic renal 
      disease and proteinuria. After a 4-week wash-out period in which patients did not
      use any medication known to affect proteinuria, 21 patients were randomized in a 
      double-blind fashion to receive either the calcium channel blocker amlodipine
      (Amlo, 5 to 10 mg) or the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril (Lis, 5 to 10 mg). Throughout 
      the 16-week study period, blood pressure, creatinine clearances, and proteinuria 
      were measured every 2 weeks. In addition, device-measured blood pressure and
      renal hemodynamic studies were performed at the start and end of the study.
      Systolic blood pressure fell in the Lis group from 163+/-7 (SEM) to 140+/-8 mm Hg
      (P < .01) and from 157+/-10 to 147+/-6 mm Hg in the Amlo group; diastolic blood
      pressure fell from 101+/-3 to 86+/-7 mm Hg in the Lis group and from 98+/-3 to
      91+/-2 mm Hg in the Amlo group. Renal hemodynamics were not affected by
      amlodipine treatment, whereas a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was seen
      in lisinopril-treated patients (from 55+/-11 to 50+/-10 mL/min; P < .01).
      Amlodipine did not significantly affect proteinuria. Lisinopril induced a decline
      in the protein-creatinine ratio with a maximal effect reached after 12 to 16
      weeks of therapy (from 0.39+/-0.17 to 0.26 +/-0.11 g/mmol; P < .009). In
      conclusion, we could not demonstrate an antiproteinuric effect of the long-acting
      dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine, whereas therapy with the
      ACE-inhibitor lisinopril resulted in a decrease in proteinuria. Amlodipine did
      not affect renal hemodynamics, whereas lisinopril induced a fall in GFR.

TI  - A comparison of nisoldipine coat-core and felodipine in the treatment of
      mild-to-moderate hypertension.
PG  - 221-5
AB  - The efficacy and safety of nisoldipine CC and felodipine were compared in a
      multicentre, randomised, double-blind, trial in patients with mild-to-moderate
      hypertension (n = 229). Following a two-week placebo run-in period, patients were
      randomised to 16 weeks' active treatment with nisoldipine coat core (CC) 20-40 mg
      or felodipine 5-10 mg once daily. At week 16, a higher proportion of patients in 
      the nisoldipine CC group were on low-dose therapy (51% vs 36%, p = 0.07). The
      proportion of treatment responders was 77.8% with nisoldipine CC and 66.5% with
      felodipine. The mean change from baseline in systolic/diastolic blood pressure
      was -18.8/-13.6 mmHg with nisoldipine CC and -17.4/-11.3 mmHg with felodipine.
      The most common adverse events included peripheral oedema and headache; neither
      treatment affected heart rate. Thus, nisoldipine CC and felodipine provide
      comparable antihypertensive efficacy. The adverse effects of both drugs are
      related to their vasodilator properties and are common to the class.

TI  - Intravenous diltiazem in acute myocardial infarction. Diltiazem as adjunctive
      therapy to activase (DATA) trial.
PG  - 620-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was defined as a pilot investigation of the usefulness and
      safety of intravenous diltiazem as adjunctive therapy to tissue plasminogen
      activator in acute myocardial infarction, followed by oral therapy for 4 weeks.
      BACKGROUND: Experimental studies have documented that calcium antagonists protect
      the myocardial cell against the damage caused by coronary artery occlusion and
      reperfusion, yet no benefits have been conclusively demonstrated in acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI) in humans. METHODS: In this pilot study, 59 patients 
      with an AMI treated with tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) were
      randomized, double blinded, to intravenous diltiazem or placebo for 48 h,
      followed by oral therapy for 4 weeks. The primary objective was to detect an
      effect on indices of regional left ventricular function and perfusion. Patients
      were also closely monitored for clinical events, coronary artery patency and
      indices of infarct size and of left ventricular function. RESULTS: Creatine
      kinase elevation, Q wave score, global and regional left ventricular function and
      coronary artery patency at 48 h were not significantly different between the
      diltiazem and placebo groups. A greater improvement observed in regional
      perfusion and function with diltiazem was likely explained by initial larger
      defects. Diltiazem, compared to placebo, reduced the rate of death, reinfarction 
      or recurrent ischemia at 35 days from 41% to 13% (p=0.027) and prevented the need
      for an urgent intervention. The rate of death or myocardial infarction was
      reduced by 65% (p=0.15). These benefits could not be explained by differences in 
      baseline characteristics such as age, site and extent of infarction, time of
      inclusion or concomitant therapy. Heart rate and blood pressure were reduced
      throughout the study with active diltiazem treatment. Side effects of diltiazem
      were bradycardia and hypotension that required transient or permanent
      discontinuation of the study drug in 27% of patients, vs. 17% of patients with
      placebo. CONCLUSIONS: A protective effect for clinical events related to early
      postinfarction ischemia and reinfarction was suggested in this study, with
      diltiazem administered intravenously with t-PA followed by oral therapy for 1
      month, with no effect on coronary artery patency and left ventricular function
      and perfusion.

AB  - Sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains a significant medical problem in the United
      States. The incidence of SCD increases with advancing age because cardiovascular 
      disease is more prevalent in the elderly. Management of ventricular arrhythmias
      in the elderly patient is especially challenging because of increased risk of
      interventional and pharmacologic therapies, altered pharmacokinetics of drugs,
      and sometimes unclear long-term benefits.

TI  - Amlodipine once-daily in systemic hypertension.
PG  - 618-21
AB  - The calcium channel blocker nifedipine is widely used in children with systemic
      hypertension: however, because of the short duration of action, three to four
      daily doses of the standard preparation are required. Amlodipine once-daily, a
      calcium channel blocker structurally related to nifedipine with an excellent
      bioavailability and a long elimination half-time, has been shown to reduce blood 
      pressure in adults. No information is available on the use of amlodipine in
      childhood. The effects of amlodipine once-daily (5 to 10 mg) were therefore
      assessed in 28 paediatric patients with hypertension. Amlodipine was withdrawn in
      five patients who experienced oedema and flushing. In the remaining 23 patients
      blood pressure was significantly reduced 3 weeks after amlodipine (on average by 
      7/5 mm Hg) and further decreased at 12 weeks (by 21/12 mm Hg). Heart rate and
      body weight were unchanged. In eight patients concomitantly treated with
      cyclosporine, the blood level of this agent was stable throughout the study, thus
      not requiring any dose adjustment. CONCLUSION: The study illustrates the
      antihypertensive properties of amlodipine once-daily in paediatric hypertension. 
      Amlodipine appears particularly indicated in patients concomitantly treated with 
      cyclosporine.

TI  - Inhaled nitric oxide as a screening agent for safely identifying responders to
      oral calcium-channel blockers in primary pulmonary hypertension.
PG  - 265-70
AB  - In a subset of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), high doses of 
      oral calcium-channel blockers (CCB) produce a sustained clinical and haemodynamic
      improvement. However, significant side-effects have been reported during acute
      testing with CCB. Therefore, to identify accurately patients who may benefit from
      long-term CCB therapy, there is a need for a safe, potent and short-acting
      vasodilator. The aim of this study was to compare the acute response to inhaled
      nitric oxide (NO) and oral high doses of CCB in 33 consecutive patients with PPH.
      A significant acute vasodilator response was defined by a fall in both mean
      pulmonary artery pressure and total pulmonary resistance by >20%. Ten patients
      responded acutely to NO, nine of whom responded acutely to CCB, without any
      complications. The 23 other patients failed to respond to NO and CCB. In these
      nonresponders, nine serious adverse events were observed with CCB (38%). There
      was no clinical or baseline haemodynamic feature predicting acute vasodilator
      response. Long-term oral treatment with CCB was restricted to the nine acute
      responders and a sustained clinical and haemodynamic improvement was observed in 
      only six patients. In primary pulmonary hypertension, the acute response rate to 
      high doses of calcium-channel blockers is low (27%). Serious adverse reactions to
      high doses of calcium-channel blockers during acute testing are frequently
      observed in nonresponders. It is concluded that nitric oxide may be used as a
      screening agent for safely identifying patients with primary pulmonary
      hypertension who respond acutely to calcium-channel blockers and may benefit from
      long-term treatment with these agents.

TI  - Surgical treatment of cyclosporine A- and nifedipine-induced gingival
      enlargement: gingivectomy versus periodontal flap.
PG  - 791-7
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare probing depth resolution achieved by
      gingivectomy and periodontal flap techniques in the treatment of cyclosporine A- 
      and nifedipine-induced gingival enlargement. Ten kidney transplant patients who
      were receiving cyclosporine A and nifedipine for at least 6 months participated
      in the study. Five patients were randomly assigned to the gingivectomy group and 
      5 patients to the periodontal flap group. Only anterior segments of the oral
      cavity (canine to canine) were surgically treated. Clinical measurements,
      including probing depths, plaque index, and gingival sulcus index, were taken at 
      baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. Results showed that probing depths,
      while similar for both groups in the first 6 weeks of the study, were
      significantly shallower for the periodontal flap group when compared to the
      gingivectomy group at 6 months (2.48 +/- 0.34 mm versus 4.87 +/- 0.79 mm,
      respectively) and 1 year (322 +/- 0.65 mm versus 6.40 +/- 1.02 mm, respectively).
      Within its limitations, this study suggests that the pocket reduction achieved by
      the periodontal flap may be sustained for longer periods of time than by the
      gingivectomy technique in the treatment of cyclosporine A- and nifedipine-induced
      gingival enlargement.

TI  - Differences between amlodipine and lisinopril in control of clinic and

PG  - 411-6
AB  - The anti-hypertensive efficacy of once-daily amlodipine (up to 10 mg) and
      lisinopril (up to 20 mg) were compared in terms of clinic and ambulatory blood
      pressure (BP) control, in an observer-blind, two-period crossover study.
      Following a 4-week placebo run-in period, patients underwent two active treatment
      phases each lasting 12 weeks and separated by a 4-week washout period. Sixty
      patients with a supine diastolic BP between 90 and 120 mm Hg were included,
      irrespective of whether or not they had received previous anti-hypertensive
      medication. Amlodipine reduced supine systolic and diastolic clinic BP
      significantly more than lisinopril (-20+/-2/-14+/-1 vs -11 3/-7+/-1 mm Hg;
      P=0.02/ P=0.001) 24 h post-dose. Clinic standing diastolic BP was also
      significantly reduced with amlodipine compared with lisinopril (P=0.05). Both
      drugs produced control of mean ambulatory BP relative to baseline over 24 h.
      Amlodipine showed more consistent control of BP over the 24-h period in contrast 
      to lisinopril which exerted its greatest effect during the daytime.

      labor.
PG  - 239-44
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the tocolytic efficacy and maternal tolerance of
      nifedipine with ritodrine in the management of threatened preterm labor. METHODS:
      Prospective randomized study of 52 singleton pregnancies with preterm labor
      between 26 and 34 week's gestation. The capacity to delay delivery 48 h, 7 days, 
      until week 36 or until fetal weight reached 2500 g were the outcome variables
      assessed. Doppler ultrasound studies were performed on the fetal umbilical artery
      as control. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the delay of
      delivery, but significantly fewer maternal side-effects were found in the
      nifedipine group. Doppler ultrasound results were similar in both groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Nifedipine is a valid and well-tolerated alternative among the
      tocolytic drugs, and apparently does not significantly alter fetal vascular blood
      flow.

TI  - Effect of single-drug therapy on reduction of left atrial size in mild to
      moderate hypertension: comparison of six antihypertensive agents.
PG  - 140-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac effects of hypertension include increased left ventricular
      (LV) mass and LV hypertrophy, as well as increased left atrial size, a predictor 
      of stroke and atrial fibrillation. Although literature on reduction of LV mass
      with antihypertensive therapy is extensive, little information is available on
      effects of treatment on left atrial size. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with mild
      to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomly
      allocated to treatment with atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem,
      hydrochlorothiazide, or prazosin in a double-masked trial. Two-dimensional
      targeted M-mode echocardiography was used to assess left atrial size and LV mass 
      at baseline, 8 weeks, and 1 and 2 years. Longitudinal analysis examined changes
      in left atrial size from the baseline study, statistically adjusting for age,
      race, pretreatment left atrial size and LV mass, and serial measurements of
      systolic blood pressure, body weight, urinary sodium excretion, and physical
      activity score. Without adjustment for covariates, only hydrochlorothiazide was
      associated with decreases in left atrial size from baseline at 8 weeks (-1.0 +/- 
      5.2 mm; P=0.052), 1 year (-2.0 +/- 5.1 mm; P=0.02), and 2 years (4.6+/-7.2 mm;
      P=0.002). After adjustment for effects of covariates, patients with normal left
      atrial size had greater reduction (-3.3 mm) in left atrial size at 2 years with
      hydrochlorothiazide than with any other drug. For patients with left atrial
      enlargement, left atrial size decreased significantly with hydrochlorothiazide,
      atenolol, clonidine, and diltiazem at 1 year and with all treatments at 2 years. 
      However, reduction at 2 years was greater with hydrochlorothiazide than with
      captopril or prazosin. CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive drugs differ in their
      effects on left atrial size. Hydrochlorothiazide was associated with greater
      overall reduction of left atrial size than other drugs effective for the
      treatment of hypertension. Reduction of left atrial size with therapy is in part 
      independent of factors known to influence left atrial size, including LV mass and
      reduction of LV mass with treatment. The clinical benefit of reducing left atrial
      size with antihypertensive treatment remains to be determined.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, but not calcium antagonism, improves a 
      response of the renal vasculature to L-arginine in patients with essential
      hypertension.
PG  - 16-24
AB  - Endothelial function has been shown to be impaired in patients with essential
      hypertension. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether
      antihypertensive drug therapy improves impaired endothelium-dependent renal
      vasorelaxation in essential hypertensive patients without atherosclerosis. We
      evaluated the effects of intravenous infusion of L-arginine (500 mg/kg given over
      30 minutes) on systemic and renal hemodynamics in 27 patients with mild to
      moderate essential hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with
      either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor imidapril or the calcium
      antagonist amlodipine for 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion. After the 12 weeks,
      the decrease in blood pressure was similar in the imidapril (n=14) and amlodipine
      (n=13) groups. The increase in renal plasma flow was also similar in both groups.
      L-Arginine-induced renovascular relaxation was increased by imidapril (renal
      plasma flow, 9.6+/-5.1% to 14.4+/-7.4%; renal vascular resistance, -10.4+/-8.1%
      to -16.7+/-9.2%, P<0.05, respectively) but not by amlodipine. Urinary excretion
      of nitrite/nitrate in response to L-arginine was significantly increased by
      imidapril (90+/-29% to 134+/-63%, P<0.05) but remained unchanged by amlodipine.
      These findings suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improves the
      impaired endothelium-dependent renovascular relaxation in patients with essential
      hypertension due to the increase in nitric oxide production and that the
      reduction in blood pressure with a calcium antagonist does not play a major role 
      in the potentiation of L-arginine/nitric oxide-mediated effects.

PG  - 157-8
AB  - Mibefradil is a T-type and L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) released in the
      United States in 1997 for management of hypertension and chronic stable angina.
      Postmarketing surveillance revealed a potential serious interaction between
      mibefradil and beta-blockers, digoxin, verapamil, and diltiazem, especially in
      elderly patients. The manufacturer voluntarily withdrew mibefradil on June 8,
      1998. We describe 4 cases of cardiogenic shock in patients taking mibefradil and 
      beta-blockers who began taking dihydropyridine CCBs. One case resulted in death; 
      the other 3 survived episodes of cardiogenic shock with intensive support of
      heart rate and blood pressure. Physicians who are preparing to switch patients'
      medications from mibefradil to other antihypertensive agents should be aware of
      these potentially life-threatening drug-drug interactions.

PG  - 27-9
AB  - Calcium antagonists (CaAs) are divided into three structural classes, typically
      represented by verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine. As a group, the principal
      (type I) adverse effects of these drugs relate to the pharmacological action of
      calcium channel blockade, namely vasodilation, and include dizziness, flushing,
      palpitations and peripheral oedema. The clinical safety of the new
      dihydropyridine CaA, barnidipine, has been assessed in more than 12 clinical
      trials, including 2041 patients who have been treated with one or more doses of
      barnidipine (dose of up to 50 mg). Adverse events with barnidipine are of mild to
      moderate intensity, most commonly of type I, occurring in the early phase of
      treatment. The incidence of serious adverse events and the rate of withdrawals
      are low. Hence, barnidipine is likely to be well tolerated in general clinical
      use.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine versus felodipine extended release on 24-hour ambulatory
      blood pressure in hypertension.
PG  - 690-6
AB  - Amlodipine and felodipine are calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine type.
      The elimination half-life of amlodipine is longer than that of felodipine. To
      study whether the different elimination rates of the drugs were reflected in
      different duration of blood pressure (BP) control, we compared amlodipine and
      felodipine extended release (ER) by both conventional clinic BP 24 h after drug
      intake and 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), with special reference to
      nighttime and morning blood pressure. Two hundred and sixteen patients with
      primary hypertension (supine diastolic BP, 95 to 115 mm Hg) were randomized to
      receive amlodipine or felodipine ER in a multicenter study. The starting dose of 
      both drugs was 5 mg. If the target clinic diastolic BP (90 mm Hg) had not been
      achieved after 4 weeks the dose was increased to 10 mg. Twenty-four-hour ABPM was
      performed with the subjects taking placebo medication before randomization and
      after 4 and 8 weeks undergoing active treatment. Significantly more patients
      responded after 4 weeks of treatment with amlodipine (50%) as compared with
      felodipine (33%) (P = .013). ABPM during daytime (07:00 to 23:00) was similar
      during both treatments, but nighttime systolic (P = .026) and diastolic (P =
      .019) BP was more effectively reduced by amlodipine than by felodipine. After 8
      weeks 82% achieved the target pressure with amlodipine and 69% with felodipine (P
      = .036 for the difference). Amlodipine seems to be more effective than felodipine
      when the drugs are compared in the same dose, with regard to the effect on clinic
      BP 24 h after dosing and to ambulatory BP during the night. The longer
      elimination half-life of amlodipine as compared to felodipine is the probable
      reason for this finding.

TI  - Effects of amlodipine and lisinopril on left ventricular mass and diastolic
      function in previously untreated patients with mild to moderate diastolic
      hypertension.
PG  - 109-17
AB  - The aim of the study was to compare the effects of two long-acting
      antihypertensive agents, the calcium-antagonist amlodipine and the ACE inhibitor 
      lisinopril, on left ventricular mass and diastolic filling in patients with mild 
      to moderate diastolic hypertension from primary care centres. It is a 1-year
      prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, comparative study.
      Patients between 25 and 75 years of age with untreated hypertension with elevated
      diastolic blood pressure (> or = 95 mmHg) on three occasions (twice on the first 
      visit and once only on the second and third visits) were recruited from a
      population survey. After 4 weeks placebo run-in 71 patients were randomized to
      dosages of amlodipine 5-10 mg or lisinopril 10-20 mg, which were titrated on the 
      basis of the effects on blood pressure. Fifty-nine patients completed the study
      period. Primary endpoints were left ventricular mass index and early to atrial
      peak filling velocity. Office and ambulatory blood pressure and other
      echocardiographic measurements were considered secondary. Decrease in blood
      pressure was equal for both treatment regimens. A statistically significant
      decrease in left ventricular mass index in both treatment groups was observed:
      -11.0 g/m2 (95% CI: -6.0, -16.1) in the amlodipine group and -12.6 g/m2 (95% CI: 
      -8.2, -17.0) in the lisinopril group. The higher the baseline value of left
      ventricular mass before treatment, the more the decrease after treatment. Early
      to atrial peak filling velocity did not change significantly within the treatment
      groups: +0.07 (95% CI: -0.01, +0.15) in the amlodipine group and +0.01 (95% CI:
      -0.06, +0.08) in the lisinopril group. However, analysis of time measurements of 
      the early peak showed significant changes for both treatment groups. No
      significant differences in primary and secondary endpoints between treatment
      groups were found. Twelve patients did not complete the study, seven in
      amlodipine and five in lisinopril, basically due to adverse events. The effects
      of amlodipine and lisinopril on left ventricular mass and early to atrial filling
      peak velocity after 1 year of treatment in patients with previously untreated
      mild to moderate hypertension are similar. Further studies are recommended,
      particularly with a larger sample size and a follow-up of longer duration.

TI  - Calcium antagonists, is there a real concern about safety?
PG  - 61-5
AB  - Calcium antagonists are widely used in the treatment of arterial hypertension
      and, or in ischemic heart disease. During the last 3 years, controversial
      articles and editorials have been published concerning the potential risk of
      calcium antagonists in regard to mortality, cancer and haemorrhage. The
      information has been mainly derived from case-control studies. The major concern 
      about such observational studies of treatment outcome is the large potential for 
      systematic error to affect the results. However, overviews of controlled trials
      with calcium antagonists do not provide clear evidence of an effect of calcium
      antagonists on mortality, risk of cancer and risk of bleeding.

TI  - Comparative effects of felodipine ER, amlodipine and nifedipine GITS on 24 h
      blood pressure control and trough to peak ratios in mild to moderate ambulatory
      hypertension: a forced titration study.
PG  - 682-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 24 h antihypertensive efficacy and duration of action 
      of felodipine extended release (ER) in comparison with two other long acting
      dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, amlodipine and nifedipine gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system (GITS), in patients with mild to moderate essential
      hypertension substantiated by ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. DESIGN: 
      Randomized, forced titration, parallel group study. Clinic BP was measured at
      every patient's visit, and 24 h ambulatory BP was monitored at baseline and at
      the end of each dose-titration period. SETTING: Single centre: hypertension
      research unit in Quebec City, Quebec. PATIENTS: There were 89 patients enrolled
      into the study. Eighty-four eligible patients were randomized, and 83 completed
      the study and were included in the final efficacy analysis. INTERVENTIONS:
      Following a two-to four-week washout period (baseline), patients were randomly
      allocated to receive felodipine ER 5 mg, amlodipine 5 mg or nifedipine GITS 30 mg
      for four weeks (low dose). All study patients had their daily dose doubled to
      felodipine ER 10 mg, amlodipine 10 mg or nifedipine GITS 60 mg for a further four
      weeks (high dose). MAIN RESULTS: Significant (P < 0.001) and similar changes from
      baseline in clinic BP were observed in all treatment groups for low and high
      doses. Ambulatory BP profiles showed comparable blood pressure reductions with
      felodipine ER and amlodipine, and a trend towards a lesser reduction with
      nifedipine GITS during 24 h, daytime and night-time periods. BP loads were
      similarly reduced with the three treatments. Trough to peak ratios (T:Ps) were
      calculated from 24 h ambulatory BP curves according to two different approaches: 
      for diastolic and systolic BP, respectively, the global approach produced T:Ps of
      0.49 and 0.50 with felodipine ER 5 mg; 0.50 and 0.34 with felodipine ER 10 mg;
      0.70 and 0.60 with amlodipine 5 mg; 0.88 and 0.82 with amlodipine 10 mg; 0.65 and
      0.55 with nifedipine GITS 30 mg; 0.68 and 0.53 with nifedipine GITS 60 mg. T:Ps
      in the individual approach were 0.07 and 0.10 with felodipine ER 5 mg; 0.23 and
      0.31 with felodipine ER 10 mg; 0.22 and 0.31 with amlodipine 5 mg; 0.45 and 0.58 
      with amlodipine 10 mg; 0.27 and 0.31 with nifedipine GITS 30 mg; and 0.24 and
      0.40 with nifedipine GITS 60 mg. CONCLUSION: There was no evidence in this study 
      of a difference among felodipine ER, amlodipine and nifedipine GITS in lowering
      ambulatory or clinic BP. Treatment based on ambulatory BP may be preferable to
      treatment guided by T:Ps because ambulatory BP is firmly established as a
      predictor of cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, there is no consensus on how to
      calculate T:Ps, and different methods of calculation may give divergent results.

TI  - Cinnarizine-induced parkinsonism: ten years later.
PG  - 453-6
AB  - A retrospective study was carried out to investigate the evolution of patients
      diagnosed with cinnarizine-induced parkinsonism (CIP) over the past 15 years. A
      total of 74 cases of CIP were found among 172 patients with drug-induced
      parkinsonism (DIP). Both CIP and other DIP were significantly more frequent in
      women. No clinical differences between CIP and other DIP were found. Most of the 
      patients (66 of 74) completely recovered after cinnarizine withdrawal in 1-16
      months. Eleven patients later developed Parkinson's disease; four of them had
      previously recovered. Five patients had tardive dyskinesia. CIP accounts for a
      high proportion of DIP referred to neurologists in populations in which
      cinnarizine is widely prescribed. The symptoms typically resolve after drug
      withdrawal, although complete recovery may take more than 1 year.

TI  - Compliance and antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine compared with nifedipine
      slow-release.
PG  - 478-86
AB  - Poor compliance is a principal cause of treatment failure in hypertensive
      patients. Once-daily dosing improves compliance, but 24-h antihypertensive
      activity should be provided. The compliance, efficacy, and safety of amlodipine
      and nifedipine slow-release (SR) were compared in patients with mild-to-moderate 
      essential hypertension recruited among 24 centers in France. After a 2-week
      washout period, 103 patients were randomized to 12 weeks of 5 to 10 amlodipine mg
      once daily (n = 55) or 20 mg nifedipine SR twice daily (n = 48). Compliance was
      calculated by electronic drug monitoring. Efficacy was measured by ambulatory and
      casual BP recordings. Patients receiving amlodipine demonstrated better
      compliance than patients receiving nifedipine SR with respect to compliance index
      (the total number of doses taken divided by the total number of doses prescribed,
      expressed as a percentage; 98.3% v 87%; P < .0001), days on which the correct
      number of doses were taken (92.5% v 74.8%; P < .0001), and prescribed doses taken
      on schedule (88.7% v 71.6%; P < .0001). Absolute and relative therapeutic
      coverage were higher in patients receiving amlodipine than nifedipine SR (P <
      .0001). Mean SBP and DBP decreased equally in both groups, although amlodipine
      offered better BP control compared with nifedipine SR at specific times of day.
      Fewer patients had high nocturnal SBP with amlodipine (39.3%) than nifedipine SR 
      (71.4%; P = .042). Adverse events and treatment withdrawals occurred less
      frequently in amlodipine-treated patients than in nifedipine SR-treated patients.
      Amlodipine (5 to 10 mg) once daily provides improved compliance, better 24-h BP
      control, and fewer adverse events than 20 mg nifedipine SR twice daily in
      patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.

TI  - Direct medical costs of coronary artery disease in the United States.
PG  - 1110-5
AB  - To generate current incidence-based estimates of the direct medical costs of
      coronary artery disease (CAD) in the United States, a Markov model of the
      economic costs of CAD-related medical care was developed. Risks of initial and
      subsequent CAD events (sudden CAD death, fatal/nonfatal acute myocardial
      infarction [AMI], unstable angina, and stable angina) were estimated using new
      Framingham Heart Study risk equations and population risk profiles derived from
      national survey data. Costs were assumed to be those related to treatment of
      initial and subsequent CAD events ("event-related") and follow-up care
      ("nonevent-related"), respectively. Cost estimates were derived primarily from
      national public-use databases. First-year direct medical costs of treating CAD
      events are estimated to be $17,532 for fatal AMI, $15,540 for nonfatal AMI,
      $2,569 for stable angina, $12,058 for unstable angina, and $713 for sudden CAD
      death. Nonevent-related direct costs of CAD treatment are estimated to be $1,051 
      annually. The annual incidence of CAD in the United States is estimated at
      616,900 cases, with first-year costs of treatment totaling $5.54 billion. Five-
      and 10-year cumulative costs in 1995 dollars for patients who are initially free 
      of CAD are estimated at $9.2 billion and $16.5 billion, respectively; for all
      patients with CAD, these costs are estimated to be $71.5 billion and $126.6
      billion, respectively. The direct medical costs of CAD create a large economic
      burden for the United States health-care system.

      Intervention Trial in Dilated Cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the interventional effects of diltiazem on
      autoantibody mediated myocardial damage in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). 221
      patients with DCM in 16 hospitals were included in the multiple centre clinical
      trial from January 1995 to November 1996, using the diltiazem or placebo based on
      the background therapy for heart failure. Patients were randomly divided into
      groups for a single blind trial, followed by observation for an average of 7.4
      months. After treatment, the heart function of 84% of patients in the diltiazem
      group recovered to grade I or II, but this occurred for 64% of patients in the
      placebo group. Heart-thorax ratio was decreased from 0.59+/-0.07 to 0.56+/-0.07
      and the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDd) from 65.40+/-8.60 mm to 
      61.12+/-9.86 mm, the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was increased from
      35.75+/-10.78% to 42.52%+/-11.41% (P<0.01) in the diltiazem group (n=114). The
      above parameters were not significantly changed in the placebo group (n=107).
      Mortality was 3.5% in the diltiazem group and 11.2% in the placebo group
      (P<0.05). Further analysis also shows that LVEDd were reduced and EF were
      obviously elevated in patients with DCM of LVEDd <70 mm, but the above parameters
      weren't improved in patients of LVEDd >70 mm. The study suggests that diltiazem
      is safe and effective in the treatment of DCM, the action mechanism might be
      intervention in antibody-mediated myocardial damage and protection of myocardium.
      Diltiazem is suitable for the treatment of the early stage in DCM.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers in heart failure.
PG  - 38-46
AB  - A considerable effort has been made in the last 15 years to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in the treatment of patients with
      chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Available studies have provided strong
      evidence for a potential detrimental effect of the first-generation calcium
      antagonists in patients with CHF, indicating the need for great caution when
      these drugs are used in patients with significant depression of left ventricular 
      systolic function. A number of second-generation CCB have demonstrated a strong
      vasodilatory effect and favorable hemodynamic action but failed to show a similar
      improvement in exercise capacity, morbidity and mortality. Moreover, drugs such
      as nicardipine and nisoldipine have resulted in a detrimental effect in some
      patients and, therefore, cannot be considered safe when used in patients with
      moderate-to-severe heart failure. Available information from the V-HeFT III study
      demonstrate a lack of an unfavorable effect of felodipine on exercise tolerance
      in patients with chronic heart failure. Although mortality rate was similar in
      both the felodipine and the placebo group, because of the relatively small number
      of patients in this study, no clear conclusion can be drawn regarding the effect 
      of felodipine on mortality in patients with CHF. An encouraging signal regarding 
      a potential role of CCB in the treatment of chronic heart failure has been
      provided by the recently completed PRAISE study. This prospective large-scale
      study demonstrated the safety of amlodipine, a long-acting dihydropyridine
      derivative, when used in patients with heart failure due to coronary artery
      disease. Furthermore, this study demonstrated a substantial reduction in
      mortality in patients with CHF due to nonischemic cardiomyopathy and provided a
      strong indication for a potential therapeutic benefit of amlodipine when added to
      standard CHF therapy in this patient population. No clear explanation is
      available at the present time regarding the reason for the deleterious effect
      demonstrated with some of the dihydropyridines and the contrasting benefit seen
      with amlodipine. Finally, more information regarding the safety and efficacy of
      dihydropyridines should become available in the next year. The PRAISE II study is
      ongoing and will provide further information regarding the therapeutic role of
      amlodipine in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. The MACH-1 study 
      is evaluating the effect of mibefradil, a predominant T-type channel blocker with
      an ideal activity profile, on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic
      CHF.

TI  - Calcium channel antagonists: morbidity and mortality--what's the evidence?
PG  - 1551-60
AB  - Recent studies have shown an association between the use of calcium channel
      antagonists for the treatment of hypertension and an increased risk of myocardial
      infarction, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and cancer. The interpretation of the
      results of these studies and their application to clinical practice requires an
      understanding of study design constraints, conflicting results and limitations in
      extrapolating study findings to other dosage strengths, formulations or agents
      within the calcium channel antagonist class. A review and critique of these
      studies provides background information on the controversial subject of using
      calcium channel antagonists for the treatment of hypertension. Despite the
      limitations of these studies, clinicians may want to select other classes of
      agents, including diuretics and beta blockers, as first-line therapy until the
      morbidity and mortality effects related to the use of calcium channel antagonists
      are clearly known.

TI  - A placebo-controlled comparison of diltiazem and amlodipine monotherapy in
      essential hypertension using 24-h ambulatory monitoring.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - Thirty patients (17 females, median age 55 years) with mild/moderate hypertension
      (sitting diastolic blood pressure 95-110 mmHg over 2 consecutive weeks)
      participated in a study of the efficacy and tolerability of once-daily diltiazem 
      "controlled delivery" 180 mg-360 mg and amlodipine 5-10 mg compared with placebo 
      (using clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurement (Accutraker II). The
      study was conducted in a general practice setting using a randomized double-blind
      crossover design with Latin square allocation of treatment order within subjects.
      During each phase, doses were titrated to achieve a predose clinic sitting
      diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg. Three patients withdrew while taking
      amlodipine and 3 while taking placebo. The numbers of patients receiving the
      higher dose in each phase were as follows: placebo 22, diltiazem 12 and
      amlodipine 19. End-of-phase mean clinic sitting blood pressures were as follows: 
      placebo 152/100, diltiazem 146/95 and amlodipine 140/93. End-of-phase mean 24-h
      ambulatory blood pressures were as follows: placebo 151/93, diltiazem 143/86 and 
      amlodipine 137/84. Both clinic and ambulatory blood pressures were therefore
      significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in both active phases compared with placebo, and
      systolic blood pressure was also significantly lower with amlodipine compared
      with diltiazem. Heart rate was increased with amlodipine. Both drugs were well
      tolerated, and adverse events were predictable for each agent, with amlodipine
      causing more vasodilator side effects. Thus both amlodipine and diltiazem
      once-daily are effective in reducing blood pressure. While amlodipine is more
      potent than diltiazem in reducing systolic blood pressure, it causes more
      vasodilator side effects.

TI  - A comparison of the safety and efficacy of mibefradil and nifedipine SR in
      patients with renal disease and hypertension.
PG  - 160-6
AB  - The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of mibefradil and nifedipine SR were
      compared in 143 patients with chronic renal failure and mild-to-moderate
      hypertension in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-design study.
      At treatment week 12, a significantly greater decrease in sitting diastolic blood
      pressure (SDBP) was seen with mibefradil than with nifedipine SR (12.8 mmHg vs
      8.1 mmHg, respectively; p = 0.014). A significantly greater number of
      mibefradil-treated patients achieved normalization of SDBP by week 12 (62% vs
      37%; p < 0.01). The changes in renal function parameters and the incidence of
      adverse events were similar in both groups. In this population, 12 weeks of
      treatment with mibefradil were more effective than nifedipine SR for lowering
      blood pressure and had similar effects on renal function parameters.

TI  - Epidural verapamil reduces analgesic consumption after lower abdominal surgery.
PG  - 786-90
AB  - In this double-blind study, we administered lumbar epidural bupivacaine or
      bupivacaine plus verapamil to investigate the possible role of the calcium
      channel blocker, verapamil, in postoperative pain. One hundred patients (ASA
      physical class I or II) scheduled for lower abdominal surgery were randomly
      assigned to one of four groups. Group 1 received 10 mL of 0.5% epidural
      bupivacaine injected 15 min before incision, followed by 10 mL of epidural normal
      saline 30 min after incision. Group 2 received 10 mL of epidural normal saline
      injected before incision, followed by 10 mL of 0.5% epidural bupivacaine 30 min
      after incision. Group 3 received 10 mL of 0.5% epidural bupivacaine plus 5 mg of 
      verapamil injected before incision, followed by 10 mL of epidural normal saline
      30 min after incision. Group 4 received the same drugs as Group 3, in the reverse
      order. Pain and mood numeric rating scores, sedation scores, Prince Henry scores,
      patient-controlled cumulative postoperative analgesic consumption, and the
      incidence of side effects were assessed 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the
      operation in each group. Cumulative postoperative analgesic consumption in Groups
      3 and 4 was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that in Groups 1 and 2 24 and 48 
      h after surgery. There were no differences in the pain, mood, and sedation scores
      and the incidence of side effects among the four groups. We conclude that
      epidural verapamil decreases postoperative pain, possibly by interfering with
      normal sensory processing and by preventing the establishment of central
      sensitization. Implications: Calcium plays an important role in pain physiology
      at the spinal cord level. We examined the effect of bupivacaine plus verapamil
      (calcium channel blocker) and of bupivacaine alone. We demonstrated that the
      combination, administered epidurally, resulted in less postoperative analgesic
      consumption than bupivacaine alone.

TI  - Effects of lisinopril and nifedipine on the progression to overt albuminuria in
      IDDM patients with incipient nephropathy and normal blood pressure. The Italian
      Microalbuminuria Study Group in IDDM.
PG  - 104-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intervention trials on renal function in IDDM patients with
      microalbuminuria (MA) should adopt the rate of decline of glomerular filtration
      rate (GFR) as an outcome measure. However, normotensive IDDM patients with MA
      show no change in GFR over a follow-up period of 10 years. Thus, in the present
      study, we used the cumulative incidence of progression to albuminuria (albumin
      excretion rate [AER] > 200 micrograms/min) from MA as the primary endpoint and
      the yearly increase in AER at a rate of 50% above baseline as the secondary
      end-point of renal function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-two normotensive
      IDDM patients underwent double-blind, double-dummy treatment with either
      lisinopril or slow-release nifedipine in comparison with placebo. Ten patients
      discontinued the study during the 3-year follow-up period. RESULTS: During the
      3-year follow-up period, 7 of 34 placebo-treated (20.6%), 2 of 32
      lisinopril-treated (6.3%), and 2 of 26 nifedipine-treated (7.7%) patients
      progressed to clinical albuminuria (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.03). Time-to-event
      analysis indicated a reduction in the risk of progression to macroalbuminuria of 
      58.1% (95% CI 27.8-68.4%) in the 32 patients on lisinopril (P < 0.02) and of
      62.5% (95% CI 32.5-73.4%) in the 26 patients on nifedipine (P < 0.02) after
      adjustment for mean blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and baseline AER in
      comparison with the 34 patients on placebo. Baseline AER was 71 micrograms/min
      (range: 20.7-187.3) in progressors and 73 micrograms/min (range: 20.2-174.1) in
      nonprogressors (NS). The percentage of patients who showed a > 50% yearly
      increase of AER above baseline values was significantly lower in the lisinopril
      group (13 of 32, 40.6%, P < 0.02), but not in the nifedipine group (15 of 26,
      57.7%), than in the placebo group (23 of 34, 67.6%). The lisinopril group had
      significantly lower blood pressure values during follow-up than either the
      nifedipine (P < 0.05) or the placebo (P < 0.01) group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show
      that both lisinopril and nifedipine are effective in delaying the occurrence of
      macroalbuminuria in normotensive IDDM patients with MA. As overt proteinuria
      strongly predicts end-stage renal failure, both treatments appear capable of
      preventing such a complication in normotensive IDDM patients with MA. However,
      lisinopril appears more powerful in slowing the course of nephropathy.

      hypertensive patients induced by amlodipine and nifedipine.
PG  - 111-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of amlodipine and nifedipine on heart rate and 
      parameters of sympathetic nerve activity during the acute and chronic treatment
      periods in order to elucidate their influence on cardiovascular outcome. DESIGN: 
      A randomized and single-blind study. METHODS: We performed 24 h ambulatory
      electrocardiography and blood pressure monitoring of 45 essential hypertensive
      inpatients. Plasma and urinary catecholamine levels were measured during the
      control (pretreatment) period, on the first day (acute period) and after 4 weeks 
      (chronic period) of administration of amlodipine and of short-acting nifedipine
      or its slow-releasing formulation. The low-frequency and high-frequency power
      spectral densities and low-frequency: high-frequency ratio were obtained by heart
      rate power spectral analysis. RESULTS: Blood pressure was significantly and
      similarly reduced by administrations of amlodipine, short-acting nifedipine and
      slow-releasing nifedipine during the chronic period. The total QRS count per 24
      h, which remained constant during the chronic period of administration of
      slow-releasing nifedipine and was increased by administration of nifedipine, was 
      decreased by 2.8% by administration of amlodipine. Administration of amlodipine
      decreased the plasma and urinary norepinephrine levels during the chronic period,
      whereas the levels were significantly increased by administration of short-acting
      nifedipine and not changed by administration of slow-release nifedipine. Although
      low-frequency: high-frequency ratio was increased significantly by administration
      of short-acting nifedipine and slightly by administration of slow-releasing
      nifedipine, administration of amlodipine reduced it during the acute and chronic 
      periods. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of amlodipine did not induce an increase in 
      sympathetic nerve activity in essential hypertensive patients during the chronic 
      period, suggesting that beneficial effects on essential hypertension can be
      expected after its long-term administration. Administration of slow-releasing
      nifedipine induces milder reflex sympathetic activation than does that of
      short-acting nifedipine.

      essential hypertension.
PG  - 41-52
AB  - Enalapril combined with an extended-release formulation of diltiazem was
      evaluated in a 12-week multicenter trial of 112 patients with Stages 3-4
      essential hypertension. Patients were randomized to once daily therapy with
      enalapril 5 mg plus diltiazem ER 120 mg or 180 mg. Dosages could be titrated and 
      other antihypertensive agents added for blood pressure control. Efficacy was
      assessed with sitting blood pressures at trough (24 hours postdose). Overall,
      there was a decrease of -21.7/-18.4 mmHg. Patients responding to
      enalapril/diltiazem ER alone had a reduction of -15.0/-16.3 mmHg. Of all
      patients, 70% achieved a trough sitting diastolic blood pressure of < 95 mmHg.
      Common drug-related adverse experiences were headache, dizziness, rash, and
      asthenia/fatigue. This once daily fixed-combination of enalapril/diltiazem ER was
      generally well tolerated and effective when given alone or with other
      antihypertensives in Stage 3-4 hypertension.

TI  - Effects of chronic exercise on blood pressure in Dahl salt-sensitive rats.
PG  - 73-80
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that daily exercise would reduce directly measured
      arterial blood pressure (BP) and sympathetic nervous system support of BP in
      conscious, unrestrained, female Dahl salt-sensitive rats consuming 4.0% NaCl.
      Dahl S/Jr inbred rats were assigned to daily exercise (EX) or sedentary (SED)
      treatment conditions (n = 12/group) at 4 weeks of age. Rats in the EX group were 
      housed in cages with attached running wheels. After 5 weeks of exercise, rats
      were running 10.3 +/- 1.7 km/day. After at least 5 wks of treatment, all rats in 
      both groups were placed on a 4.0% NaCl diet for 2 weeks to produce sodium-induced
      hypertension. Rats continued to either exercise daily or remain sedentary for an 
      additional 2 weeks while consuming the high sodium diet. Carotid and jugular
      catheters were then implanted for measurements in conscious, resting,
      unrestrained rats on two separate days. Daily wheel running exercise for 7 to 9
      weeks did not alter BP or HR in Dahl S/Jr rats consuming a 4.0% NaCl diet.
      However, acute arterial depressor responses to ganglionic blockade were less in
      EX rats. Furthermore, greater alpha-adrenergic (phenylephrine-induced) pressor
      responses were observed in the EX group while under ganglionic blockade. The
      findings suggest that overall resting sympathetic neural activity or cardiac
      beta-adrenergic responsiveness to sympathetic activity is reduced in this model
      of hypertension by daily wheel running exercise.

TI  - Comparison of the fixed combination of enalapril/diltiazem ER and their
      monotherapies in stage 1 to 3 essential hypertension.
PG  - 23-30
AB  - The safety and efficacy of two fixed dose combinations of enalapril and diltiazem
      extended release formation (ER) (E/D) were compared with their monotherapies and 
      placebo in patients with stage 1 to 3 hypertension. The trial design was a
      multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, 12
      week treatment phase, followed by a 36 week, open label phase. A total of 891
      patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) between 95 and 115 mm Hg
      were randomly assigned to enalapril 5 mg, diltiazem ER 120 mg, diltiazem ER 180
      mg, enalapril 5 mg/diltiazem ER 120 mg (E5/D120), enalapril 5 mg/ diltiazem ER
      180 mg (E5/D180), or placebo. In the open label phase, 562 patients received the 
      fixed combination, titrated as needed to control SiDBP < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy was
      determined with trough (24 +/- 2 h postdose) sitting blood pressure measurements 
      at week 12 and at the end of the open label part of the study. Safety was
      evaluated based on patient symptoms, clinical laboratories, and
      electrocardiograms (ECG). E5/D120 and E5/D180 significantly reduced trough SiDBP 
      (-7.6 and -8.3 mm Hg, respectively; P < .05) versus their monotherapies. E5/D120 
      and E5/D180 significantly reduced trough sitting systolic blood pressure (-7.9
      and -9.0, respectively; P < .05) versus both diltiazem ER monotherapies. All
      active treatments significantly decreased SiDBP and SiSBP versus placebo. E/D
      effectively lowered SiDBP and SiSBP during the open label extension. No
      significant difference was seen among treatment groups for the overall incidence 
      of adverse events. The most common drug related adverse events were headache,
      edema/swelling, dizziness, asthenia/fatigue, cough, rash, and impotence. The
      event frequency for the combinations were similar to those seen with the
      monotherapies. Fixed combinations of E/D were generally well tolerated, with an
      increased blood pressure lowering effect as compared with the individual
      components in patients with stage I to III hypertension.

TI  - The natriuretic effect of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system remains 
      despite the presence of mild-to-moderate renal failure.
PG  - 1803-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium channel blockers facilitate the renal excretion of sodium and
      this effect is maintained during chronic administration of these drugs. However, 
      it is unknown whether this natriuretic effect remains despite the presence of a
      decreased renal function. OBJECTIVE: To compare the natriuretic capacity of
      nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) and lisinopril in patients 
      with mild-to-moderate chronic renal failure. METHODS: An open-label, randomized, 
      comparative study was conducted to compare the natriuretic capacity of nifedipine
      GITS and lisinopril in the presence of mild-to-moderate renal failure (creatinine
      clearance 30-80 ml/min). After a wash-out period of 4 weeks an intravenous saline
      infusion (30 ml/kg of body weight of isotonic saline in 4 h) was performed and
      repeated after 4 weeks of active therapy. Two sex- and age-matched groups of
      hypertensive patients (n = 25) were included in the study. Renal failure was
      diagnosed as secondary to nephrosclerosis in all the patients. RESULTS: A
      significant increase in the renal capacity to excrete the sodium load was
      observed in patients receiving nifedipine GITS (n = 11) but not in those taking
      lisinopril (n = 13). Both drugs controlled blood pressure to a similar extent. No
      changes were observed in body weight, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma
      flow (measured as inulin and paraaminohippurate clearances). A significant drop
      was observed in urinary albumin excretion after lisinopril, but not after
      nifedipine. Heart rate was higher in nifedipine group. CONCLUSION: The
      natriuretic capacity of nifedipine GITS remains despite the presence of
      mild-to-moderate chronic renal failure. Such an effect takes place in the absence
      of changes in renal hemodynamics, suggesting that it is caused by a direct
      tubular effect.

TI  - Comparison of effects of controlled onset extended release verapamil at bedtime
      and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system on arising on early morning
      blood pressure, heart rate, and the heart rate-blood pressure product.
PG  - 424-31
AB  - We assessed the differential effects of a chronotherapeutic agent
      (controlled-onset extended release [COER] verapamil), administered at bedtime
      versus a conventional, homeostatic therapy (nifedipine gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system [GITS]) taken in the morning, on early morning and 24-hour
      blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and the HR x systolic BP product. The study
      was a multicenter (n = 51), randomized, double-blind prospective clinical trial
      with a 10-week treatment period. Dose titration was performed by study
      investigators based on systolic and diastolic BP values at the doctor's office.
      Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed at placebo baseline, after 4 weeks of
      stable double-blind therapy, and at end of the study. Twenty-four-hour BP
      profiles were studied in 557 hypertensive patients. Changes in BP, HR, slope of
      the rate of rise of BP and HR, and the HR-systolic BP product during the 4 hours 
      from 1 hour before to 3 hours after awakening were evaluated. The study was
      powered to show equivalence between the 2 regimens, predefined as a difference
      between treatment groups in mean change from baseline in early morning BP of +/- 
      5 mm Hg systolic and +/- 3 mm Hg diastolic. Changes in the early morning BP fell 
      within the definition of equivalence for the 2 treatment strategies (-12.0/-8.2
      mm Hg for COER-verapamil and -13.9/-7.3 mm Hg for nifedipine GITS). Changes in
      both the early morning HR and rate-pressure product were significantly greater
      following COER-verapamil therapy versus nifedipine GITS (HR, -3.8 beats/minute vs
      +2.6 beats/minute, p < 0.001 and HR-systolic BP product, -1,437 beats/min x mm Hg
      vs -703 beats/min x mm Hg, respectively, p < 0.001). Changes in ambulatory BP
      demonstrated clinically similar reductions for the awake period, but nifedipine
      GITS lowered systolic BP to a greater extent than COER-verapamil during sleep
      (-11.0 vs -5.8 mm Hg, p < 0.001). COER-verapamil and nifedipine GITS had
      equivalent effects (+/- 5/3 mm Hg) on early morning BP. In addition, both
      extended-release calcium antagonists effectively lowered 24-hour BP. However,
      COER-verapamil had greater effects than nifedipine GITS on early morning
      hemodynamics (HR, HR-systolic BP product, rate of rise of BP and HR) and lesser
      effects during sleep due to its intrinsic pharmacologic properties and
      chronotherapeutic delivery system.

PG  - 21-7
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of verapamil SR 240 mg (V)
      and the combination amiloride 5 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg (AH) on diastolic 
      dysfunction of hypertensive patients without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). 
      Twenty-six hypertensive patients with diastolic dysfunction, normal systolic
      function and without LVH were included into a 2-week washout period and then
      randomised to a 6-month V or AH treatment. One blinded-to-treatment
      echocardiographist at baseline and at weeks 4, 12 and 24 assessed
      Doppler-echocardiography. Both V and AH, satisfactorily controlled blood
      pressure, but only V improved diastolic function shown by a tendency to reduce
      peak A and to increase peak E/A ratio, and by a significant reduction in
      deceleration time. After 24 weeks, V significantly reduced wall thickness in
      comparison with AH. These results need to be confirmed in a larger scale study.

TI  - Calcium antagonists and cancer. Is there really a link?
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Recent publications have raised concerns about a possible link between calcium
      antagonist therapy and the development of cancer. Comparisons of the methodology 
      and results of these studies with other studies where an association between
      calcium antagonist therapy and cancer has not been apparent suggests that the
      association is most likely to be due to selection bias or chance. Clinical and
      biochemical studies have not produced a consistent plausible mechanism for a
      causative link between calcium antagonists and the development of cancer. Further
      prospective data that will be available from long-term morbidity and mortality
      trials of the use of calcium antagonists in cardiovascular diseases will be of
      value in establishing the safety of these drugs.

TI  - Relationships between changes in left ventricular mass and in clinic and
      ambulatory blood pressure in response to antihypertensive therapy.
PG  - 1493-502
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the relationships between changes in left ventricular mass 
      in response to 6-month antihypertensive therapy and changes in conventional and
      automated measurements of clinic blood pressure, average 24 h ambulatory blood
      pressure and daytime and night-time blood pressures. DESIGN: After a placebo
      run-in period, patients with essential hypertension (World Health Organization
      stages I-II) were treated for 6 months with one or a combination of two
      first-line antihypertensive drugs. METHODS: Investigations included
      echocardiography, conventional and automated clinic blood pressure measurements
      and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Daytime and night-time blood pressures 
      were assessed according to two clock-time-dependent and two
      clock-time-independent methods, with a wide and a narrow approach for each
      technique. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients completed the 6-month treatment period.
      Left ventricular mass, adjusted for sex and body size, was correlated
      significantly to systolic and diastolic clinic blood pressures, both before (r = 
      0.57 and r = 0.48, P < 0.001) and during antihypertensive therapy (r = 0.43, P < 
      0.001 and r = 0.27, P < 0.05). Changes in left ventricular mass were
      significantly related to changes in blood pressure. The correlation coefficients 
      amounted to 0.39 (P < 0.01) and 0.40 (P < 0.01) for the conventional and
      automated measurements of clinic systolic blood pressures, respectively, and to
      0.45 (P < 0.001) for the average 24 h systolic blood pressure; these r values
      were 0.27 (NS), 0.20 (NS) and 0.43 (P < 0.01), respectively, for the diastolic
      blood pressure. The average 24 h blood pressure added 7.4% (P < 0.05) and 6.2% (P
      = 0.06) to the variance of the changes in mass explained in terms of the
      conventional and the automated measurements of clinic systolic blood pressures,
      respectively, and 11.2% (P < 0.05) and 14.5% (P < 0.01) for the diastolic blood
      pressures. The changes in daytime and night-time blood pressures predicted the
      changes in left ventricular mass significantly (P < 0.01) and to a similar
      extent, irrespective of the analytical method. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment-induced
      changes in left ventricular mass were significantly related to the changes in
      clinic, 24 h, daytime and night-time blood pressures; the changes in 24 h
      ambulatory blood pressure add to the variance of the changes in left ventricular 
      mass explained in terms of clinic blood pressure data.

AB  - In a randomized parallel-group placebo-controlled study, we compared the
      short-term hypotensive efficacy and the safety of a single administration of
      nifedipine-retard (20-mg tablets) with that of two administrations 6 h apart of
      nifedipine capsules (10 mg) in 10 and 11 black patients, respectively, with acute
      severe hypertension. Both groups had similar pretreatment blood-pressure (BP)
      values. Blood pressure was recorded at 10-min intervals for 12 h by using an
      automated device. In the first 3 h of treatment, nifedipine capsules induced a
      faster and greater hypotensive effect than nifedipine retard, which was
      associated with an increase in heart rate. At 2 h after treatment, nifedipine
      capsules decreased BP to levels (159 +/- 5/105 +/- 3 mm Hg) that were
      significantly lower than those reached by nifedipine-retard (175 +/- 4/118 +/- 4 
      mm Hg; p < 0.05). Both preparations induced a similar maximal BP decrease of
      approximately 30% of the placebo values, but the peak decrease of BP occurred
      significantly later with nifedipine-retard (283 +/- 31 min after administration) 
      than with nifedipine capsules (100 +/- 14 min; p < 0.01). Four hours after
      administration, the hypotensive effect of nifedipine capsules was blunted, and a 
      second administration was necessary, whereas nifedipine-retard reduced BP slowly 
      and continuously for < or =12 h and more smoothly. Flush and headache were more
      frequently found with nifedipine capsules. We conclude that in black patients
      with hypertensive crisis, nifedipine capsules produce an abrupt decrease in BP
      that may be potentially harmful. Thus for patients suitable for treatment with
      nifedipine, nifedipine-retard is preferable because it effectively reduces BP for
      > or =12 h while achieving a rapid enough effect without critical short-term
      decreases in BP.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and tolerability of two long-acting calcium antagonists,
      mibefradil and amlodipine, in essential hypertension. Mibefradil Hypertension
      Study Group.
PG  - 1368-78
AB  - In a previous forced-titration trial, mibefradil 100 mg QD was as effective as
      amlodipine 10 mg QD in reducing sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP), and it
      produced significantly less leg edema than did amlodipine 10 mg QD. The present
      multicenter, double-masked, randomized, parallel-design trial was performed to
      assess the reproducibility of these results using a flexible-titration design.
      Following a 4-week, single-masked, placebo run-in period, 296 patients with a
      trough SDBP of between 95 and 114 mm Hg (21 to 27 hours postdose) were randomized
      to receive once-daily treatment with mibefradil 50 mg (n = 146) or amlodipine 5
      mg (n = 150). In patients whose trough SDBP was greater than 90 mm Hg after 4 or 
      8 weeks of double-masked therapy, the dosage was titrated upward to mibefradil
      100 mg or amlodipine 10 mg for the remainder of the 12-week active treatment
      period. A greater proportion of amlodipine-treated patients (65%) than of
      mibefradil-treated patients (54%) required titration to the higher dose. Despite 
      this difference, statistically equivalent reductions in trough SDBP were observed
      after 12 weeks of treatment with 50 to 100 mg of mibefradil QD (-11.7 +/- 6.4 mm 
      Hg) and 5 to 10 mg of amlodipine QD (-11.9 +/- 6.9 mm Hg). SDBP was normalized to
      < or = 90 mm Hg at week 12 in 66% of patients treated with mibefradil and 65% of 
      those receiving amlodipine. The tolerability profile of mibefradil was superior
      to that of amlodipine, with significantly fewer patients (P = 0.009) reporting
      leg edema after mibefradil treatment (7%) than after amlodipine treatment (17%). 
      The results of this study confirm those of the previous trial. Once-daily
      treatment with mibefradil 50 to 100 mg for 12 weeks was as effective as 12 weeks 
      of once-daily treatment with amlodipine 5 to 10 mg in reducing SDBP and was
      associated with a significantly lower incidence of leg edema.

TI  - Malignant hypertension and hypertensive emergencies.
PG  - 133-42
AB  - Hypertensive emergencies and urgencies are important causes of morbidity and
      mortality. Malignant hypertension is a hypertensive urgency characterized by
      grade III/IV retinopathy and widespread endothelial damage. Control of BP is
      essential in the treatment of these disorders. The effects of hypertension on
      target organ function need to be balanced against the risks of excessive BP
      lowering. In hypertensive emergencies, BP should be lowered within minutes with
      parenteral agents to prevent critical end-organ damage. In hypertensive
      urgencies, BP can be lowered more slowly over several hours, often with oral
      agents, to avoid a detrimental fall in BP. The absolute indications for treatment
      and the optimal therapy depend on the underlying condition.

TI  - Main results of the losartan versus amlodipine (LOA) study on drug tolerability
      and psychological general well-being. LOA Study Group.
PG  - 1327-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare two losartan regimens (with and without
      hydrochlorothiazide) and amlodipine in treating mild-to-moderate hypertension
      regarding their blood-pressure-lowering effect, drug tolerability and quality of 
      life. DESIGN: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-centre
      study. After 4 weeks of placebo, patients with a diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
      in the range 95-115 mmHg were allocated randomly to be administered 50 mg
      losartan (increased to 100 mg if the DBP was 90 mmHg or more after 6 weeks), 50
      mg losartan (plus 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide under the above conditions), or 5
      mg amlodipine (increased to 10 mg under the above condition). The tolerability of
      the treatment and the quality of life were evaluated by spontaneous reporting,
      active questioning and the Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) index. STUDY
      POPULATION: In total 898 hypertensives, mainly referred from primary health care 
      (mean age 57.8 years) of whom 52% were men. RESULTS: Administration of 50 mg
      losartan (plus 12.5 hydrochlorothiazide if necessary) and of 5 mg amlodipine (or 
      10 mg if necessary) lowered the blood pressure as well as or better than did 50
      mg losartan (or 100 mg if necessary). The incidence of 'any discomfort' and
      'swollen ankles' increased with amlodipine but not with losartan treatment. The
      opposite was found for 'dizziness upon standing'. The incidence of drug-related
      adverse events and the number of patients withdrawn from therapy were higher with
      amlodipine than they were with losartan treatment. The PGWB index at week 12
      indicated that improvements from baseline had occurred in some domains for the
      losartan groups whereas it remained unchanged for the amlodipine group.
      CONCLUSION: Both losartan and amlodipine were effective in lowering the blood
      pressure and were tolerated well. Administration of 50 mg losartan (plus 12.5 mg 
      hydrochlorothiazide if necessary) and of 5 mg amlodipine (or 10 mg if necessary) 
      lowered the blood pressure equally well or better than did 50 mg losartan (or 100
      mg if necessary). Drug-related adverse effects and withdrawal from the study were
      more common for the amlodipine group. The clinical significance of the
      improvements in the PGWB index with losartan needs to be studied further.

TI  - Efficacy of a low dose nifedipine GITS (20 mg) in patients with mild to moderate 
      hypertension.
PG  - 921-7
AB  - Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) is a once-a-day formulation
      of nifedipine providing stable plasma concentrations over the entire 24 h dosing 
      interval. The antihypertensive efficacy of a new 24 mg formulation was evaluated 
      in 187 patients in 15 centres across the country. After a two-week placebo
      washout, mild to moderate hypertensive patients were randomized in a
      double-blind, parallel design to four weeks of placebo or nifedipine GITS 20 mg
      once daily treatment. Changes in office blood pressure (BP) were noted for each
      group. Ambulatory BP was also monitored at baseline and after four weeks of
      placebo/nifedipine therapy in a subgroup of 66 patients at five centres. After
      four weeks of treatment, office BP in the placebo group decreased by 5.0 +/-
      11.9/5.4 +/- 7.9 mmHg compared with 9.3 +/- 11.2/8.6 +/- 7.4 mmHg in the
      nifedipine GITS group. Both systolic and diastolic BP were significantly
      decreased (P = 0.006 and P = 0.001 for systolic and diastolic, respectively) more
      with nifedipine GITS. Heart rate did not significantly differ between the groups 
      at baseline nor after four weeks of treatment. The percentage of
      responders--defined as having a sitting diastolic BP less than 90 mmHg or a
      decrease from baseline of 10 mmHg--was 57% for nifedipine GITS versus 32% for
      placebo (P < 0.05). Daytime average diastolic blood pressure was 86.4 +/- 6.4
      mmHg in the nifedipine GITS 20 mg group compared with 93.7 +/- 8.9 mmHg in the
      placebo group (P < 0.02). The maximum antihypertensive effect of nifedipine
      during ambulatory monitoring was similar to the reduction in BP observed in the
      office at the end of the dosing interval. The frequency of spontaneously reported
      adverse events was similar for nifedipine GITS (32.3%) and placebo (37.2%). These
      results indicate that 20 mg of nifedipine GITS is efficacious in decreasing BP,
      with good 24 h control and an incidence of adverse events similar to that of
      placebo-treated patients.

TI  - Patterns of compliance with once versus twice daily antihypertensive drug therapy
      in primary care: a randomized clinical trial using electronic monitoring.
PG  - 914-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patterns of compliance with once versus twice daily
      administration of antihypertensive therapy (primary-outcome measure) and
      relevance of partial compliance for blood pressure control (secondary outcome
      measure). DESIGN: Multicentre, nonblinded, parallel group randomized design.
      SETTING: Nonacademic primary care practices across Canada. STUDY POPULATION:
      Patients with mild essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 110
      mmHg) of either sex (40% women), age 18 to 80 years (average 55 years). One
      hundred and ninety-eight patients were randomized to active treatment; 14
      patients discontinued the study because of side effects. INTERVENTIONS: After a
      four-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to amlodipine 5 mg
      once-a-day or diltiazem slow release formulation (SR) 90 mg twice daily. Doses
      were increased to 10 mg and 180 mg to achieve sitting diastolic blood pressure of
      90 mmHg or less. OUTCOME MEASURE: During 20 weeks on active treatment, compliance
      was assessed by pill counts and medication event monitoring system (MEMS),
      assessing percentage of prescribed doses taken, percentage days correct doses
      taken, percentage prescribed doses taken on time and blood pressure control as
      determined by office blood pressure measurement. RESULTS: The percentage
      prescribed doses taken (by either pill count of MEMS) showed a high degree of
      compliance, similar for the two treatments. However, other parameters of
      compliance were significantly better with once versus twice daily therapy.
      Partial compliance (less than 80% by pill count) led to less blood pressure
      control with the short acting diltiazem, but did not affect blood pressure
      control for the long acting amlodipine. Side effects profiles did not differ
      between the two treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Within the constraints of a clinical
      trial, hypertensive patients in primary care show a high degree of overall
      compliance with once or twice daily pill-taking, but patterns of pill-taking are 
      more erratic with twice versus once daily medication, particularly in men. The
      results suggest that the negative consequences of partial compliance for blood
      pressure control can be offset by choosing agents with a duration of action well 
      beyond the dosing interval.

TI  - Antihypertensive and renal effects of isradipine in essential hypertension: focus
      on renin system activity.
PG  - 977-83
AB  - Calcium antagonists are known to exert various effects on the kidney that might
      modulate their antihypertensive potential. This study evaluated the renal
      effects, along with the efficacy, of isradipine in two subgroups of patients with
      mild to moderate essential hypertension (EH), defined according to plasma renin
      activity (PRA). Twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive 12-week
      treatment with slow-release isradipine (2.5-5 mg) or placebo. Assessment of PRA
      related to concurrent 24-hour sodium excretion was used to define patients with
      high/medium (n=16) and low renin profile (n=10). Urinary albumin excretion (UAE),
      serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR, as endogenous creatinine
      clearance) were measured. Blood pressure (BP) decrease with isradipine was
      greater in the low PRA group as compared with the high/medium PRA group (P<0.05),
      and normalization of BP was achieved in all low-renin patients compared with 57% 
      in the high/medium PRA group. BP reduction in the placebo group was statistically
      not significant. Isradipine, but not placebo, induced significant reduction in
      UAE (P<0.05); the decrease was similar in both PRA groups. Treatment did not
      cause any significant changes in GFR, PRA, urinary sodium or creatinine
      excretion, or serum aldosterone or creatinine concentrations. The decrease of BP 
      in the whole isradipine-treated group was inversely correlated with pretreatment 
      serum creatinine as well as with basal urinary creatinine excretion. In
      conclusion, the antihypertensive effect of isradipine was more pronounced in
      low-renin EH patients, despite similar effects on renal function and UAE in both 
      PRA groups.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of diltiazem CD for
      reducing blood pressure in Mexican-American patients with mild to moderate
      hypertension. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
      SETTING: Twelve clinical sites in the United States. PATIENTS: Patients with
      baseline diastolic blood pressures between 95 and 115 mm Hg. INTERVENTIONS:
      Patients were treated with an average daily dose of diltiazem CD 246 mg (60
      patients) or placebo (58 patients) to achieve a trough diastolic blood pressure
      below 90 mm Hg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Diltiazem CD significantly reduced
      mean diastolic blood pressure compared with placebo, -8.2 versus -4.1 mm Hg,
      respectively (p=0.0025). Diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg or a reduction
      of 10 mm Hg or more was achieved by 57% of diltiazem CD versus 28% of placebo
      recipients. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were also reduced with
      diltiazem CD. Adverse events were mild, with similar frequency for diltiazem CD
      (15%) and placebo (19%). CONCLUSION: Diltiazem CD is safe and effective in
      hypertensive Mexican-Americans, and diastolic blood pressure reductions compare
      with those in non-Hispanic white patients.

TI  - Effects of amlodipine in patients with chronic heart failure.
PG  - 872-8
AB  - The role of calcium antagonists in patients with ischemic heart failure is
      currently unclear. We examined the effects of amlodipine on exercise capacity and
      central and regional hemodynamics in 32 patients with mild to moderate chronic
      heart failure in a single-center, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled
      trial. All were taking at least 40 mg of furosemide daily with an
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Ischemic heart disease was the most
      common cause of heart failure, but no patient had symptom-limiting angina. Mean
      treadmill exercise capacity in patients taking amlodipine increased by 96 seconds
      (95% confidence interval -23 to 215) and 50 seconds (-34 to 135) in the placebo
      group; mean difference in change between treatments was 70 seconds (-90 to 233), 
      p = 0.38. Active treatment with amlodipine did not affect self-paced corridor
      walking times. Similarly, there were no significant effects on cardiac output,
      oxygen uptake, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure at rest or during exercise.
      Calf and renal blood flow were also unchanged by treatment. The lack of
      significant effect demonstrated by these data suggests a limited role for
      amlodipine in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, although it may prove
      beneficial in those with nonischemic disease. More data are required before
      amlodipine can be recommended for all patients with chronic heart failure.

TI  - Comparison of amlodipine and long-acting diltiazem in the treatment of mild or
      moderate hypertension.
PG  - 1263-9
AB  - The comparative effects of the once a day calcium channel antagonists amlodipine 
      and long-acting diltiazem were assessed in a parallel design,
      investigator-blinded, multicenter trial in 123 patients with diastolic blood
      pressures ranging from 95 to 114 mm Hg before treatment. Patients were randomized
      to one of the two drugs and titrated at 2-week intervals to 5 or 10 mg of
      amlodipine or 180, 240, or 360 mg of long-acting diltiazem during a 10-week
      treatment period. Both drugs significantly reduced resting, sitting, standing,
      and 24-h ambulatory systolic and diastolic pressures. Amlodipine caused
      significantly greater reductions in sitting and standing systolic pressures,
      standing diastolic pressures, and 24-h ambulatory systolic and diastolic
      pressures versus diltiazem. Sitting systolic pressures were reduced from 151.9
      +/- 2.0 (SE) at baseline to 137.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg with amlodipine treatment and
      from 149.0 +/- 2.1 to 145.1 +/- 2.5 mm Hg with diltiazem. Sitting diastolic
      pressures were reduced from 100.2 +/- 0.6 to 87.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg with amlodipine
      and from 101.1 +/- 1.0 to 91.9 +/- 1.1 mm Hg with diltiazem. Reductions in
      standing systolic pressures after treatment were -12.1 +/- 1.5 mm Hg amlodipine v
      -4.6 +/- 1.5 mm Hg diltiazem (P < .01), and reductions in standing diastolic
      pressures were -11.8 +/- 0.9 mm Hg amlodipine v -8.6 +/- 0.9 mm Hg diltiazem (P <
      .02). Heart rates did not change significantly with either drug during the study.
      Two subjects in each group dropped out because of adverse experiences. Although
      both agents were well tolerated and reduced blood pressures consistently over the
      10-week test period, amlodipine was more effective than diltiazem in reducing
      systolic and diastolic blood pressures to the target pressures of < 140 mm Hg
      systolic and < 90 mm Hg diastolic over a range of doses widely used in clinical
      practice.

TI  - Comparison of isradipine and enalapril effects on regional carotid circulation in
      patients with hypertension with unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis.
PG  - 562-70
AB  - This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was aimed at detecting
      cerebrovascular effects of isradipine and enalapril in patients with moderate
      hypertension depending on the presence and grade on unilateral stenosis of
      internal carotid artery (ICA). We evaluated carotid vascular resistance by using 
      Doppler analysis and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by using 133Xe-clearance
      technique before and after a single 5-mg oral dose of isradipine, enalapril, or
      placebo. Their effects were randomly and consecutively tested in 73 patients with
      essential hypertension subdivided into three groups: without carotid occlusive
      lesions, with moderate (50-75%), and with severe (76-99%) unilateral asymptomatic
      ICA stenosis. There were no differences in age, gender, and antihypertensive
      effects of the drugs between these three subgroups. Three major variants of
      cerebrovascular drug effects were observed: absence of changes (variant I),
      decrease in carotid vascular resistance with increase in rCBF and elimination of 
      side-to-side asymmetry (variant II), and increase in carotid vascular resistance 
      with further reduction of rCBF ipsilaterally ICA stenosis, and increased
      side-to-side asymmetry (variant III). Frequency of variant III was significantly 
      higher in patients with severe ICA stenosis. Enalapril produced variant I of
      cerebrovascular effects in most patients examined; variant III was observed only 
      in 13% of patients with severe ICA stenosis. Isradipine produced variant I of
      cerebrovascular effects much less frequently than did enalapril. For this drug,
      variant II was most typical in patients without ICA stenosis and with moderate
      ICA stenosis. In 43.5% of patients with severe ICA stenosis, however, isradipine 
      produced reduction of cerebral perfusion. Presumably the presence of ICA
      stenosis, especially >75%, increases the risk of cerebrovascular disorders in
      antihypertensive therapy. In patients with severe ICA stenosis, treatment with
      enalapril appears to be safer than that with isradipine.

TI  - Calcium antagonism abolishes the antipressor action of vasopressin (V1) receptor 
      antagonism.
PG  - 1153-8
AB  - Previous studies demonstrate that vasopressin (V1) receptor antagonism lowers
      arterial pressure in blacks. This action of V1 receptor blockade may be mediated 
      through various mechanisms including changes in intracellular calcium fluxes.
      This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that inhibition of calcium entry
      may attenuate the reduction in arterial pressure observed with V1 receptor
      blockade. Sixteen hypertensive patients, 8 whites and 8 blacks, were examined.
      Each had their antihypertensive therapy stopped for 1 week. Following three
      baseline blood pressure measurements, all patients were given an intravenous
      bolus injection of a V1 receptor antagonist. Blood pressure was monitored every
      10 min for a period of 3 h. Subjects were then randomized to either 0.2 mg
      clonidine twice daily or 300 mg diltiazem CD daily for a period of 3 days and the
      previous experiments repeated. Patients were then crossed over to the other drug 
      for an additional 3 days and the experiments repeated. There was a significant
      reduction from baseline in the mean arterial pressure among blacks but not whites
      (-11 +/- 3 delta mm Hg blacks versus -1 +/- 2 delta mm Hg whites, P < .01). In
      the presence of clonidine, there were similar reductions in arterial pressure in 
      both groups (P = .026) with a further reduction following V1 receptor blockade
      only in the blacks (-7 +/- 3 delta mm Hg blacks versus 6 +/- 2 delta mm Hg
      whites; P < .001). Conversely, in the presence of diltiazem CD, there were no
      further reductions in arterial pressure in either group following the V1 receptor
      antagonist. We conclude that calcium channel blockade abolishes the blood
      pressure lowering response of V1 receptor blockade in blacks.

TI  - The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study: 24-month data on blood pressure
      and tolerability.
PG  - 313-7
AB  - The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study is an ongoing prospective
      randomized, multicentre trial conducted in 26 countries. There are two main aims 
      of the study. The first is to evaluate the relationship between three levels of
      target diastolic blood pressure (< or = 90, < or = 85 or < or = 80 mmHg) and the 
      incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. The
      second is to determine the effect on morbidity and mortality of a low dose, 75 mg
      daily, of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) compared with placebo. Altogether
      18,790 patients have been recruited and randomized, and two-year data are now
      available for all patients. This is a report on the blood pressures achieved, the
      tolerability, and other available data after 24 months of follow-up of all
      patients. Special emphasis is given to the subgroup of elderly patients (> or =
      65 years, n = 5988) compared with young patients (< 65 years, n = 12 802). On
      average, patients in the < or = 90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure target group
      have reached 85 mmHg, in the < or = 85 mmHg target group patients have reached 83
      mmHg and in the < or = 80 mmHg target group patients have reached 81 mmHg. The
      percentage of those achieving target blood pressure in each target group at 24
      months of follow-up is 85% in the < or = 90 mmHg target group, 75% in the < or = 
      85 mmHg target group and 57% in the < or = 80 mmHg target group. In the elderly
      subgroup (> or = 65 years of age), the percentage of patients achieving target at
      24 months is higher for all target groups, namely 89% in the < or = 90 mmHg
      group, 80% in the 85 mmHg group and 62% in the 80 mmHg group. Antihypertensive
      treatment was initiated with a calcium antagonist, felodipine, at a dose of 5 mg 
      once daily. If target blood pressure was not reached, additional antihypertensive
      therapy, with either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a
      beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, was given. Further dose adjustments were made
      in accordance with a set protocol. As a fifth, and final, step, a diuretic could 
      be added. There have been relatively few side effects in this large,
      multinational study of hypertensive patients. Only ankle oedema and coughing
      exceed a frequency of 0.5% (ankle oedema 1.3% in young and 1.7% in elderly;
      coughing 0.5% in young and elderly). After two years, 84% of all patients are
      still taking their baseline therapy, felodipine. The 24-month data presented here
      indicate that it should be possible to fulfil the primary aims of the HOT Study.

TI  - Long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium
      antagonists on the right and left ventricles in essential hypertension.
PG  - 557-64
AB  - To compare the effects of chronic antihypertensive treatment on left and right
      ventricular structure and function, 24 patients with mild to moderate,
      never-treated hypertension were randomized to receive fosinopril (20 mg daily) or
      amlodipine (10 mg daily) for 12 months. At baseline and subsequently at the end
      of third, sixth, and twelfth months, each patient underwent an integrated
      echocardiographic study and noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
      Both drugs significantly reduced blood pressure, casual or monitored (p < 0.01), 
      and left ventricular mass index (from 125 +/- 32 to 100 +/- 12 gm/m2 [p < 0.02]
      with amlodipine and from 106 +/- 18 to 89 +/- 10 gm/m2 [p < 0.02] with
      fosinopril). The decrease in left ventricular mass was essentially caused by a
      reduction of ventricular thickness. Free right ventricular wall thickness was
      also lowered in both groups, more consistently with amlodipine (from 8.0 +/- 2.1 
      to 6.4 +/- 0.8 mm; p < 0.01), without an increase in plasma natriuretic peptide
      and insulin concentrations or heart rate. With both treatments, the decrease in
      ventricular mass was not associated with impairment of systolic function, whereas
      a trend toward an improvement of Doppler echocardiographic indexes of
      biventricular diastolic function was observed. In conclusion, both amlodipine and
      fosinopril induced similar qualitative effects on anatomy and function of both
      ventricles. The clinical meaning of these observations must be defined further by
      means of adequately sized prospective trials.

TI  - Salt and blood pressure responses to calcium antagonism in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 422-7
AB  - Since salt intake may affect blood pressure response to antihypertensive drugs,
      an individual's salt-sensitivity status may be an important consideration in the 
      selection of a medication. The purpose of this single-blind study was to assess
      the impact of salt sensitivity on the antihypertensive effects of isradipine. A
      total of 21 evaluable hypertensive patients (10 white, 11 black) 35 to 73 years
      of age (mean 55.9 years) were randomized to a low-salt diet (mean 24-hour urine
      sodium 100+/-14 mmol) or a high-salt diet (mean 24-hour urine sodium 210+/-22
      mmol) for 7 weeks, followed by crossover to the other diet after a 2-week washout
      period. On each diet regimen, patients received placebo for 2 weeks, followed by 
      optimal titration of isradipine (2.5 to 10 mg BID) for blood pressure control
      during the last 5 weeks. On the high-salt diet, salt-sensitive hypertensives
      (mean arterial blood pressure increase > or = 5 mm Hg, n=5) exhibited a
      systolic/diastolic blood pressure change of -18.7/-19.6 mm Hg from 157.2/102.9 mm
      Hg after 5 weeks of isradipine treatment, whereas on a low-salt diet, blood
      pressure change was -6.9/-12.0 mm Hg from 148.7/97.3 mm Hg. Non-salt-sensitive
      patients (n=16) exhibited a systolic/diastolic blood pressure change of
      -12.6/-7.6 mm Hg from 155.3/98.6 mm Hg on the high-salt diet and -19.2/-10.9 mm
      Hg from 161.0/102.6 mm Hg on the low-salt diet after treatment with isradipine.
      The absolute blood pressure attained in both salt-sensitive and
      non-salt-sensitive patients was almost identical with isradipine therapy despite 
      variation in dietary salt, although slightly higher doses of isradipine were
      required in the salt-sensitive group. Consequently, isradipine, and perhaps
      calcium antagonists in general, manifests a more robust blood pressure-lowering
      effect in the setting of high sodium intake. This effect does, however, appear to
      be largely confined to individuals who are salt sensitive.

TI  - Physical performance is preserved after regression of left ventricular
      hypertrophy.
PG  - 383-91
AB  - Reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy has been shown to improve left
      ventricular diastolic function in elderly patients with hypertension, but little 
      is known about whether this affects physical performance. Left ventricular mass, 
      cardiac function at rest and during submaximal exercise, and physical performance
      were assessed in 38 elderly patients with hypertension with left ventricular
      hypertrophy and normal systolic function before and after 8 and 14 months of
      therapy with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide or both. Blood pressure control
      was achieved with amlodipine in 18 patients, with hydrochlorothiazide in seven,
      and with the combination of these drugs in 13. Left ventricular mass index was
      similarly reduced from approximately 150 to approximately 100 g/m2 at 14 months' 
      in each treatment group. Systolic function was maintained with the three
      treatment regimens, whereas similar decreases in time to peak filling rate and
      increases in first-third filling fraction occurred both at rest and during
      submaximal exercise after 8 months and further after 14 months of therapy.
      Exercise capacity did not significantly change in the group as a whole, but
      individual changes in peak oxygen uptake at the end of treatment correlated
      significantly with the decrease in time to peak filling rate during submaximal
      exercise (r = -0.49; p < 0.01). It is concluded that long-term blood pressure
      control with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide or both is associated with
      significant reductions in left ventricular mass and improved diastolic function
      in elderly patients with hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy. Despite 
      this reduction in left ventricular mass, left ventricular systolic function and
      physical performance are well preserved during submaximal exercise.

TI  - Effects of controlled-onset extended-release verapamil on nocturnal blood
      pressure (dippers versus nondippers). COER-Verapamil Study Group.
PG  - 469-74
AB  - Approximately 1 in 4 patients with systemic hypertension have a 24-hour blood
      pressure (BP) profile characterized by a blunted or absent nocturnal decline in
      pressure. We evaluated the effects of a chronotherapeutic delivery system of
      controlled-onset extended-release (COER) verapamil hydrochloride and placebo in
      257 hypertensive patients according to their circadian BP pattern in an 8-week
      prospective, multicenter, randomized, and double-blind clinical trial. Patients
      were stratified into 193 dippers (>10% decline in BP during the period of 10 P.M.
      to 5 A.M. compared with the hours of 5 A.M. to 10 P.M.) and 64 nondippers (<10%
      decline in BP during nighttime). During daytime, placebo-subtracted BP was
      similarly decreased in dippers and nondippers by COER verapamil. During
      nighttime, the placebo increased nocturnal BP in dippers (baseline nocturnal BP, 
      133/78 mm Hg) by 3/3 +/- 2/2 mm Hg and reduced BP by -5/-3 +/- 2/2 mm Hg in
      nondippers (baseline nocturnal BP, 152/94 mm Hg) (p = NS between groups). After
      controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, and the regression to the mean observed
      on placebo for all doses, COER verapamil reduced nocturnal BP more in nondippers 
      than dippers -5.8/-2.4 mm Hg, p <0.0001 for systolic BP and p = 0.09 for
      diastolic BP). Additionally, a significant dose-related reduction in systolic and
      diastolic nocturnal BP (r = 0.56, p <0.0001 for systolic BP and r = 0.62, p
      <0.0001 for diastolic BP) was observed with COER verapamil after controlling for 
      baseline covariates. These data demonstrate that nocturnal BP is decreased by a
      greater extent in nondipper hypertensives than in dipper hypertensives following 
      treatment with COER verapamil HCL.

      blood pressure monitoring.
PG  - 176-81
AB  - The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a fixed combination of
      benazepril (10 mg) and low-dose amlodipine (2.5 mg) were assessed in 24 patients 
      (mean age, 43.9 years) with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension
      [supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 95 and < or = 120 mm Hg)]. After 2 
      weeks of washout taking placebo, patients were randomized to receive the fixed
      combination or placebo, both administered once daily for 3 weeks, according to a 
      double-blind, crossover design. Patients were checked at the end of the washout
      period and every 3 weeks thereafter. At each visit, 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring
      (ABPM) was performed by a noninvasive device (Spacelabs 90207); casual BP (by
      mercury sphygmomanometer), heart rate (HR), and body weight also were measured.
      The fixed combination significantly reduced systolic (SBP) and DBP values
      throughout the 24 h as compared with placebo, without affecting the normal BP
      circadian variability. The antihypertensive effect of the fixed combination could
      be observed to a similar extent during the day and night and was still
      significant 24 h after dosing. HR and body weight were not affected by the
      treatment. The fixed combination of benazepril 10 mg/amlodipine 2.5 mg was well
      tolerated, and no patient withdrew from the study because of side effects.

TI  - Nifedipine and ritodrine in the management of preterm labor: a randomized
      multicenter trial.
PG  - 230-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of nifedipine with ritodrine in the management
      of preterm labor. METHODS: One hundred eighty-five singleton pregnancies with
      preterm labor were assigned randomly to either ritodrine intravenously (n = 90)
      or nifedipine orally (n = 95). The principal outcome assessed was delay of
      delivery. RESULTS: Ritodrine was discontinued in 12 patients because of severe
      maternal side effects, and their results were excluded from further analysis.
      More women in the ritodrine group delivered within 24 hours (22 versus 11, P =
      .006), within 48 hours (29 versus 21, P = .03), within 1 week (45 versus 36, P = 
      .009), and within 2 weeks (52 versus 43, P = .005) compared with those receiving 
      nifedipine. There were significantly fewer maternal side effects in the
      nifedipine group. Apgar scores and umbilical artery and vein pHs were similar in 
      both groups. The number of admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) 
      in the nifedipine group was significantly lower than in the ritodrine group (68.4
      versus 82.1%, P = .04). CONCLUSION: Nifedipine in comparison with ritodrine in
      the management of preterm labor is significantly associated with a longer
      postponement of deliver, fewer maternal side effects, and fewer admissions to the
      NICU.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and tolerability of nisoldipine coat core and
      hydrochlorothiazide in mild-to-moderate hypertension.
PG  - 271-5
AB  - This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of nisoldipine coat core (CC)
      10-40 mg o.d. and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25-50 mg o.d. Patients with
      mild-to-moderate essential hypertension received either nisoldipine CC 10 mg o.d.
      or HCTZ 25 mg o.d. Treatment was titrated at two-weekly intervals as necessary.
      The primary efficacy endpoint was a defined reduction in diastolic blood pressure
      (DBP). Response rates were similar for both the nisoldipine CC- and HCTZ-treated 
      groups (74% and 70%, respectively). Secondary efficacy endpoints were reductions 
      in both diastolic and systolic blood pressures (SBP). At treatment endpoint, the 
      change from baseline in SBP was 16.2 mmHg for the nisoldipine CC group and 14.9
      mmHg for the HCTZ group. Both drugs were well tolerated, and adverse events were 
      generally minor and typical of these antihypertensive agents. Drug-related
      adverse events were greater in the nisoldipine CC- than the HCTZ-treated patients
      (50% and 37%, respectively). Nisoldipine CC was shown to demonstrate
      antihypertensive efficacy similar to HCTZ in the treatment of mild-to-moderate
      hypertension.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine on norepinephrine kinetics and baroreflex function in
      patients with congestive heart failure.
PG  - 13-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of calcium channel blocking drugs is controversial in heart
      failure, partly because of concerns about neurohormonal stimulation. Preliminary 
      data suggest that the newer agent amlodipine may be useful in this syndrome.
      Suppression of sympathetic activity either directly or by sensitized baroreflex
      function could be contributing factors to the clinical use of this drug.
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of short-term amlodipine therapy on baseline
      measures of sympathetic activity and baroreflex function in patients with chronic
      stable congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS: Seven patients with chronic CHF
      (New York Heart Association functional class II or III, moderate to severe
      reduction in left ventricular systolic function) were studied. All patients
      underwent baroreflex testing with head-up tilt, head-down tilt, and head-down
      tilt with phenylephrine infusion. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, forearm
      blood flow and resistance, and plasma norepinephrine (NE) kinetics were assessed 
      at baseline and after each baroreflex perturbation on three occasions: a control 
      test and after 10 days each of placebo and amlodipine therapy. RESULTS: Plasma NE
      and NE spillover did not significantly increase after amlodipine administration
      compared with control and placebo tests (488 +/- 119 pg/ml vs 350 +/- 85 and 325 
      +/- 87 pg/ml). In three subjects, plasma NE levels were essentially unchanged,
      whereas in four they rose markedly (289 +/- 87 pg/ml at control vs 551 +/- 158
      pg/ml). There was no difference in the response of any variable during baroreflex
      perturbations after amlodipine administration compared with control and placebo
      tests. One subject who tolerated head-down tilt coupled with phenylephrine
      administration during the control and placebo tests became markedly short of
      breath during the same intervention after amlodipine administration. Plasma NE
      levels in this patient had risen markedly while receiving amlodipine and were not
      appropriately suppressed during the baroreflex loading maneuver. CONCLUSIONS:
      Short-term therapy with amlodipine does not suppress sympathetic activity or
      alter efferent responses to baroreflex perturbation in patients with stable
      chronic CHF. Significant increases in plasma NE and NE spillover and abnormal
      responses to baroreflex stimulation are possible after administration of this
      drug. The relevance of these findings to studies in larger number of patients
      requires further study.

TI  - Additive effects of diltiazem and lisinopril in the treatment of elderly patients
      with mild-to-moderate hypertension.
PG  - 743-9
AB  - A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with multifactorial design 
      was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the calcium-channel blocker 
      diltiazem, in a sustained release preparation, and the angiotensin converting
      enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, in the treatment of elderly Chinese patients with
      mild-to-moderate hypertension. In addition to the hypotensive effects of
      combinations of both drugs compared with monotherapy, all given once daily, the
      effect on quality of life was also evaluated. This study consisted of a 3 x 2
      multifactorial design in which 156 women and men with a sitting diastolic
      pressure of between 95 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg, after a 4-week placebo washout phase,
      were randomized to one of six treatment groups for 12 weeks of active treatment. 
      Monotherapy with diltiazem 120 or 240 mg produced increasing reductions of
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared with placebo, lisinopril 10 mg
      had an effect intermediate between the diltiazem doses. The combinations of
      diltiazem 240 mg + lisinopril 10 mg and diltiazem 120 mg + lisinopril 10 mg
      showed increased efficacy in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure
      compared to these drug doses used in monotherapy, but the effect of the
      combinations was less than predicted by an additive model. Although the total
      number of other adverse events reported was similar for all active treatment
      groups compared to placebo, lisinopril-induced cough was common with an incidence
      of 31% after rechallenge. Premature drug withdrawal was necessary in four of 78
      patients receiving lisinopril, due to intractable cough. The combination of
      diltiazem 240 mg and lisinopril 10 mg was significantly more effective at
      reducing blood pressure than either drug alone; this additive effect did not
      result in a higher rate of adverse effects or impairment of quality of life.
      Thus, combination therapy with these agents was well tolerated and resulted in
      increased efficacy in these elderly patients.

TI  - Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system versus nifedipine coat-core:
      comparison of efficacy via 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
PG  - 819-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the comparable efficacy and adverse effect profile of two
      extended-release preparations of nifedipine--gastrointestinal therapeutic system 
      (GITS) and coat-core (CC)--in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.
      DESIGN: Single institution, single-blind, prospective study. SETTING: Dwight
      David Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, GA. PATIENTS: Ninety-one
      patients who were taking nifedipine GITS as a sole antihypertensive agent were
      randomized to receive either GITS or CC. After 3 weeks, 24-hour ambulatory blood 
      pressure monitoring was conducted and an adverse effect questionnaire was
      administered. The patients were then crossed over to the other treatment arm and 
      monitoring was repeated after 3 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Mean blood pressure, heart
      rates, and the percentage of readings exceeding 140 mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg
      diastolic were compared for the 24-hour period. Additionally, mean blood
      pressures at 4-hour intervals after drug administration and heart rate during the
      first 8 hours of the dosage interval were compared. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients 
      enrolled, 79 completed the study, and 62 patients were included in the efficacy
      analysis. A statistically significant difference (p = 0.020) was shown only in
      the last 4-hour systolic blood pressure. However, this difference was small (122 
      +/- 15 mm Hg with GITS vs. 126 +/- 14 mm Hg with CC). There was no difference in 
      the percentage of readings exceeding 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic.
      Neither dosage nor treatment order had an effect on the results. Adverse effects 
      were reported with a greater frequency during CC therapy (40 with CC vs. 22 with 
      GITS; p = 0.006), but were generally transient. Discontinuation of the drug was
      necessary in 3 patients during the CC cycle. CONCLUSIONS: GITS and CC
      demonstrated clinically equivalent antihypertensive efficacy in the study
      population. The CC produce may have a higher rate of adverse effects, but drug
      discontinuation was uncommon.

TI  - Coronary vasodilatory capacity and flow reserve in normal myocardium supplied by 
      bypass grafts late after surgery.
PG  - 27-31
AB  - Coronary artery bypass surgery is used widely for treating myocardial ischemia.
      However, blood flow and flow reserve of normally perfused myocardium subtended by
      bypass grafts have not been evaluated late after surgery. Also, it is unknown
      whether pharmacologic vasodilation evokes comparable myocardial flow responses in
      arterial and venous conduits. Myocardial blood flow was quantified at rest and
      during dipyridamole hyperemia using N-13 ammonia and positron emission tomography
      (PET) in 15 patients 9 +/- 3 years after bypass surgery and in 10 healthy
      volunteers. Blood flow was analyzed in 26 territories subtended by bypass grafts 
      with normal wall motion and normal perfusion. Myocardial blood flow at rest did
      not differ between patients and controls (0.65 +/- 0.14 vs 0.68 +/- 0.16 ml/
      g/min) and was similar in normal myocardium subtended by saphenous vein (n = 16) 
      and internal mammary artery grafts (n = 10; 0.64 +/- 0.13 vs 0.66 +/- 0.15
      ml/g/min). However, the hyperemic response in normal myocardium supplied by
      bypass grafts was less than that in controls (1.61 +/- 0.33 vs 2.04 +/- 0.30
      ml/g/min, p <0.005). No differences between territories supplied by venous and
      arterial conduits were observed (1.61 +/- 0.35 vs 1.63 +/- 0.32 ml/g/min). Normal
      myocardium subtended by bypass grafts exhibited a lower flow reserve than that in
      controls (2.54 +/- 0.51 vs 3.16 +/- 0.85, p <0.02). Myocardial flow reserve was
      almost identical in regions supplied by venous and arterial grafts (2.55 +/- 0.48
      vs 2.52 +/- 0.58). The similar reduction in vasodilatory capacity together with
      the normal PET polar map findings during dipyridamole argue against flow limiting
      stenoses in both venous and arterial bypass conduits late after
      revascularization. Rather, nonobstructive proliferative fibrointimal changes of
      the bypass conduits or atherosclerosis of the native resistance vessels might
      account for this finding.

TI  - Effect of gallopamil on myocardial microperfusion in patients with stable effort 
      angina: a randomized, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 353-60
AB  - We evaluated the efficacy and safety of daily administration of gallopamil 150
      mg/day and its effects on myocardial perfusion in a medium-term, randomized,
      double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial. We studied 19 patients (17
      males and 2 females; mean age 57 +/- 6.8 years) with stable effort angina,
      angiographically documented coronary artery disease and reversible perfusion
      defects during exercise thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy of at least one
      segment of the left ventricle. After 2 weeks of a single-blind placebo run-in
      period, during which each patient underwent at least 2 exercise tests and a
      48-hour Holter ECG recording, all patients were treated with either placebo or
      gallopamil 50 mg t.i.d. for 28 days. At the end of this period, patients crossed 
      over to the alternate regimen. This phase was double blind. After treatment with 
      placebo or gallopamil, patients underwent exercise tests, 24-hour Holter ECG
      recording and thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy. Weekly angina frequency and
      trinitroglycerin (TNT) consumption and safety were also evaluated. No patients
      dropped out of the study because of major side effects. The number of total
      ischemic and symptomatic events recorded at 24-hour ECG monitoring, weekly angina
      frequency and TNT consumption were significantly reduced during gallopamil
      treatment. After gallopamil administration, exercise duration significantly
      increased (run-in: 419 +/- 116 s, placebo: 420 +/- 118 s, gallopamil: 511 +/- 144
      s; p < 0.05), and ST segment depression was significantly reduced (run-in: -1.3
      +/- 0.3 mm, placebo: -1.3 +/- 0.3 mm, gallopamil: -0.94 +/- 0.68 mm; p < 0.01),
      while heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product were
      unchanged at rest, at submaximal and at peak exercise. Qualitative and
      quantitative evaluation of myocardial perfusion and the myocardial uptake
      percentage of thallium-201 in ischemic zones were significantly improved by
      gallopamil treatment. These findings demonstrate that gallopamil can improve
      myocardial perfusion and reduce myocardial oxygen consumption.

TI  - Postabsorption concentration peaks with brand-name and generic verapamil: a
      double-blind, crossover study in elderly hypertensive patients.
PG  - 526-34
AB  - The pharmacokinetic actions, bioequivalence, and cardiovascular effects of two
      verapamil products were studied in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in
      eight elderly hypertensive patients (median age, 69.5 years; range, 60-79 years) 
      given brand-name or generic immediate-release verapamil in 120-mg twice-daily
      doses for 14 days. Blood pressures, heart rates, P-R intervals; and serum
      concentrations of R-/S-verapamil and norverapamil were measured multiple times in
      patients during the last day of each therapy. Median blood pressure decreased
      more with generic verapamil than with the brand-name drug, with the largest
      difference occurring at 0.5 hours (137/74 mmHg versus 144.5/80.5 mmHg; P = 0.05
      and 0.091, respectively). Pharmacokinetic parameters were not different for the
      two products (P < 0.01). However, the generic product, compared with the
      brand-name drug, had mean area under the concentration-time curve (time 0 to 12
      hours) ratios (90% CI) of 1.09 (0.78-1.52), 1.16 (0.87-1.55) and 1.11 (0.81-1.52)
      for R-, S-, and total verapamil. Seventy concentration peaks (31 with the
      brand-name drug, 39 with the generic drug) appeared between 8 and 24 hours.
      Median percentages of increase of these peaks, compared with those of previous
      concentrations, were 48.3% and 36.3% for brand-name and generic drugs,
      respectively. Fifty of the 70 peaks (71%) were associated with a stereospecific
      concentration peak of norverapamil and, temporally, with meals. Our findings
      suggest that whereas the two verapamil products may not be bioequivalent by Food 
      and Drug Administration criteria, the observed differences in effects were not
      clinically significant in this elderly population. Multiple concentration peaks
      after absorption were observed in all patients with both verapamil products and
      were perhaps related to enterohepatic recirculation.

TI  - Short-term antihypertensive medication does not exacerbate sleep-disordered
      breathing in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.
PG  - 640-5
AB  - It has been speculated for some time that various antihypertensive medications
      may have a deleterious effect on respiration during sleep and thereby enhance the
      apparent association between hypertension and sleep apnea/hypopnea (SAH).
      However, there are few data to support this contention. The present study used a 
      double-blind, randomized, cross-over design to contrast the effects of 6 weeks
      treatment with alpha-methyldopa and the combination of hydrochlorothiazide and
      amiloride with that of amlodipine and the combined diuretics in a group of 24
      newly diagnosed patients with primary hypertension. All-night polysomnography was
      performed before the initiation of therapy (baseline) and at the end of the two
      treatment periods. Respiratory variables failed to reveal any significant
      differences between the treatments and baseline, or between the two different
      treatment regimens. The two treatment regimens achieved similar reductions in
      blood pressure. The prevalence of SAH was 25% before treatment, which is
      comparable to a prevalence of 20% in a similar group drawn from the same
      population but receiving various antihypertensive medications. The findings of
      this study are in agreement with previous reports using other classes of
      antihypertensive drugs that also failed to detect any tendency for increases in
      nocturnal respiratory disturbance indices over assessment periods of 8 weeks or
      shorter.

TI  - A comparison of two long-acting vasoselective calcium antagonists in pulmonary
      hypertension secondary to COPD.
PG  - 1622-30
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PATIENTS: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is common in COPD and 
      may predict mortality in this disorder. We have compared the pulmonary
      vasodilator effects, dose-response characteristics, and tolerability of two
      calcium channel blockers, amlodipine and extended-release (ER) felodipine, in 10 
      patients (seven men, age 68+/-4.8 [SD] years) with clinically stable COPD and PH.
      DESIGN: Drugs were given in equal single daily oral doses (2.5, 5, and 10 mg),
      increasing weekly for 3 weeks, in a randomized investigator-blinded crossover
      manner with a 1-week wash-out period between the two treatments. MEASUREMENTS:
      Doppler measurements of pulmonary hemodynamics were made on the seventh day of
      treatment at each drug dose. Lung function, arterial blood gases, and adverse
      events were also monitored weekly. RESULTS: A dose-dependent decline of pulmonary
      artery pressure (PAP) was observed with each drug. A dose of 2.5 mg produced a
      significant decrease in PAP compared with baseline (20% amlodipine, 17%
      felodipine ER). Additional decreases in PAP were observed at 5 mg and 10 mg that 
      were similar for both drugs, but did not reach statistical significance compared 
      with 2.5 mg. There was a dose-related decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance
      and increase in oxygen delivery with amlodipine and felodipine ER. Lung function 
      and blood gas values were stable throughout. Side effects (headache and ankle
      edema) were less frequent during amlodipine treatment (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both
      amlodipine and felodipine ER, given as a single daily oral dose of > or = 2.5 mg,
      are effective pulmonary vasodilators in COPD patients with PH. Their
      dose-response characteristics are similar, but amlodipine treatment was
      associated with fewer side effects.

      hypertensive patients. The Felodipine ER in the Elderly versus Young Working
      Group.
PG  - 712-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare blood pressure reduction and tolerability of
      felodipine ER (extended-release), in younger and older patients. DESIGN: A
      multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. SETTING:
      Nineteen study sites; approximately half of the sites were at academic medical
      centers and half were in private primary care practices. Patients were
      non-hospitalized and free-living. PATIENTS: There were 243 younger (< or = 61
      years) and older (> or = 64 years) patients, age range 26 to 83, with sitting
      diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 95-115 mm Hg (higher stage 1 to lower stage 3)
      on placebo. Patients volunteered for the study. INTERVENTIONS: After a 2 to 4
      week, single-blind, placebo baseline period, patients with SDBP of 95-115 mm Hg
      were randomized to treatment with felodipine ER 2.5 mg qd or placebo at a ratio
      of 3:1, felodipine:placebo. The dose of felodipine ER was increased to 5 mg qd
      after 3 weeks and to 10 mg qd after 6 weeks if the SDBP was greater than 90 mm
      Hg. MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome measure was change in SDBP. Secondary Outcome 
      measures were change in sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) and percent of
      responders, defined as SDBP less than 90 mm Hg or a > or = 10 mm Hg reduction.
      Other measurements included heart rate, weight, routine laboratory values, and
      self-reported adverse events. RESULTS: By Week 9, felodipine ER reduced blood
      pressure in the older subjects (n = 77) by 13/12 mm Hg; in the younger patients, 
      (n = 102), the reduction was 12/8 mm Hg. All reductions were significantly
      different from placebo (P < or = .003). The reduction in diastolic, but not
      systolic, blood pressure was significantly greater in the older than in the
      younger patients (P = .004 and P = .188, respectively). The percentage of
      patients reporting a clinical adverse experience was similar for felodipine ER
      and placebo treatment groups. The incidence of side effects was similar between
      old and young patients. Discontinuation occurred in 9% of the felodipine-treated 
      patients and 19% of the placebo-treated patients. Older patients required lower
      doses of felodipine ER to achieve equivalent blood pressure control. CONCLUSIONS:
      Felodipine ER is effective in lowering blood pressure and is well tolerated in
      both young and old people.

TI  - Fibrinolytic variables and cardiovascular prognosis in patients with stable
      angina pectoris treated with verapamil or metoprolol. Results from the Angina
      Prognosis study in Stockholm.
PG  - 2380-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disturbed fibrinolytic function may influence the progression of
      coronary atherosclerosis and contribute to thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: In the Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm (APSIS), patients
      with stable angina pectoris were studied prospectively during double-blind
      treatment with metoprolol or verapamil. Various measures of fibrinolytic function
      were studied in 631 (of 809) patients. During a median follow-up time of 3.2
      years (2132 patient-years), 32 patients suffered a CV death, 21 had a nonfatal
      myocardial infarction (MI), and 77 underwent revascularization. Plasma levels of 
      tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) activity and antigen (ag), plasminogen
      activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity at test, and TPA responses to exercise were 
      determined at baseline and after 1 month's treatment and were related to
      subsequent fatal and nonfatal CV events. Univariate Cox regression analysis
      revealed that elevated levels of TPA-ag at rest (P < .05), high PAI-1 activity (P
      < .05), and low TPA-ag responses to exercise (P < .05) were associated with
      increased risk of subsequent CV death. After adjustment for baseline risk
      factors, TPA-ag independently predicted CV death or MI. In addition, PAI-1
      activity independently predicted CV death or MI in male patients. Verapamil
      treatment was associated with a 10% decrease of TPA-ag levels and metoprolol
      treatment with a 2% increase (P < .001 for treatment difference). CONCLUSIONS:
      Plasma TPA-ag levels at rest, and among male patients PAI-1 activity as well,
      independently predict subsequent CV death or MI in patients with stable angina
      pectoris.

TI  - Effect of sustained-release Verapamil on the morning systemic arterial pressure
      surge during daily activity in patients with systemic hypertension.
PG  - 1252-5
AB  - In a placebo-controlled study of 13 subjects with systemic hypertension,
      sustained-release verapamil reduced the morning surge in systolic pressure by
      10.2 mm Hg (p = 0.04), diastolic pressure by 11.1 mm Hg (p = 0.008), and heart
      rate by 3.3 beats/min (p = 0.17). Blunting of the morning hemodynamic surge may
      be a mechanism by which verapamil could reduce the risk of plaque disruption and 
      acute coronary events in the morning.

      blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, natriuresis, and urinary kallikrein in
      hypertensive nephropathy.
PG  - 541-5
AB  - In this cross-over, double-blind study, 12 essential hypertensive patients (stage
      I, II, and III) with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 50 to 80
      mL/min/1.73 m2, were submitted to 4 weeks of placebo followed by 12 weeks with
      isradipine SRO (IS) 5 mg, spirapril (SP) 6 mg, and isradipine plus spirapril (IS 
      + SP). The study evaluated the effects of these drugs on GFR ((99m)Tc DTPA),
      effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) ((131)I-orthoiodohippurate), urinary sodium
      excretion (UNaV), urinary kallikrein excretion (UKal), urinary albumin excretion 
      (UAE), and plasma renin activity (PRA). The three protocols significantly reduced
      mean blood pressure (128 v 107 mm Hg; 126 v 112 mm Hg; 129 v 104 mm Hg with IS,
      SP and IS + SP, respectively). ERPF and GFR did not change. UNaV increased
      significantly after IS (0.17 v 0.22 mEq/min) and IS + SP (0.18 v 0.24 mEq/min).
      UKal increased significantly after IS (58.6%) and IS + SP (53.6%). UAE decreased 
      significantly only after SP. PRA increased significantly after IS (1.31 v 2.84
      ng/mL/h), SP (1.10 v 2.15 ng/mL/h), and after IS + SP (1.23 v 3.21 ng/mL/min). In
      conclusion, IS, SP and IS + SP were effective in reducing blood pressure while
      keeping renal function stable. Only SP significantly decreased UAE. Enhanced UKal
      may have played a role in natriuresis observed after IS and IS + SP.

TI  - Effects of verapamil SR, trandolapril, and their fixed combination on 24-h blood 
      pressure: the Veratran Study.
PG  - 492-9
AB  - The Veratran study investigated the antihypertensive efficacy of verapamil
      sustained release (SR) (180 mg), trandolapril (1 mg), and their fixed combination
      during a 24-h period. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 272 patients (age 49 
      +/- 9 years, mean +/- SD) with essential hypertension and a clinic diastolic
      blood pressure > or =100 mm Hg were randomized to verapamil, trandolapril, their 
      fixed combination, or placebo for 8 weeks, according to a multicenter
      double-blind parallel group study design. Clinic and semiautomatic blood pressure
      at trough and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure were measured at the end of run-in
      period and after 8 weeks of treatment. In the 234 patients included in the
      efficacy analysis, run-in clinic and semiautomatic blood pressures were reduced
      by verapamil, trandolapril, and combined verapamil and trandolapril significantly
      more than by placebo. The reductions obtained with the combination were
      significantly greater than those obtained by verapamil alone. Twenty-four-hour
      average blood pressures were not modified by placebo and were reduced by 8/6 mm
      Hg (systolic/diastolic) by verapamil, 11/7 mm Hg by trandolapril, and 14/11 mm Hg
      by the combination of the two drugs. The differences between the effect of the
      combination and the combination components were, in most instances, statistically
      significant. The verapamil-trandolapril combination was more effective also on
      day average blood pressure and superior to the monotherapies for the
      trough-to-peak ratio of the antihypertensive effect as well. Twenty-four-hour
      heart rate was slightly but significantly reduced by verapamil and the reduction 
      was manifest in the group taking verapamil plus trandolapril. Thus, the
      antihypertensive treatment with the fixed verapamil SR-trandolapril combination
      is more effective and balanced over the 24 hours than the effect of the
      combination components administered alone.

TI  - Isradipine for the prevention of cyclosporine-induced hpertension in allogeneic
      bone marrow transplant recipients: a randomized, double-blind study.
PG  - 1034-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension and nephrotoxicity frequently occur in patients who
      receive cyclosporine therapy after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Isradipine,
      a calcium channel entry blocker, has been used successfully in
      cyclosporine-induced hypertension. METHODS: Thirty leukemic patients who received
      cyclosporine after BMT were randomized to receive isradipine (0.005 mg/kg) from
      72 hr before commencement of cyclosporine therapy until day 100 after BMT or
      placebo. RESULTS: The placebo and isradipine groups were well matched. No
      differences were found between the isradipine and placebo groups in the level of 
      blood pressure, renal function, marrow engraftment, or mortality. Hypertension
      incidence was surprisingly low (30% a week after hospital discharge and 10% by
      day 100 after BMT), and did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Isradipine does not harm immunohematopoietic reconstitution after BMT; therefore,
      it may be used in this setting, although the previously reported incidence of
      hypertension has been exaggerated.

TI  - Reduction of left ventricular mass by antihypertensive treatment does not improve
      exercise performance in essential hypertension.
PG  - 309-17
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a reduction in left ventricular mass by
      long-term antihypertensive treatment, possibly associated with an improvement of 
      diastolic function, would increase exercise performance in patients with
      essential hypertension. DESIGNS After a placebo run-in period, 27 patients with
      essential hypertension World Health Organization stages I and II were assigned
      randomly to 6-month double-blind treatment with either a diuretic
      (hydrochlorothiazide plus triamterene) or a converting enzyme inhibitor
      (trandolapril), to which the calcium antagonist amlodipine could be added after 3
      months if required for better blood pressure control. METHOD: Investigations
      included clinic and ambulatory blood pressure measurements, left ventricular
      imaging and transmitral Doppler echocardiography and graded maximal exercise
      testing on the bicycle ergometer with respiratory gas analysis. RESULTS:
      Six-month antihypertensive therapy, which caused significant (P < 0.001)
      reductions in blood pressure (by 16% for clinic pressure) and in left ventricular
      mass (by 13%), but without convincing evidence of improved diastolic function,
      did not affect exercise performance or peak oxygen uptake. The influence on
      clinic, exercise and ambulatory blood pressures and on the peak oxygen uptake was
      similar in the two treatment arms but left ventricular wall thickness decreased
      to a greater extent in the trandolapril group (P< 0.05 at 3 months and P= 0.06 at
      6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Regression of left ventricular mass caused by 6-month
      antihypertensive therapy does not improve exercise performance of patients with
      essential hypertension.

TI  - Analysis of the risks associated with calcium channel blockade: implications for 
      the obstetrician-gynecologist.
PG  - 198-201
AB  - Calcium channel antagonists are widely prescribed in obstetrics and gynecology
      for blood pressure control and tocolysis. Concerns have recently arisen regarding
      the safety of these agents. Several studies found that short-acting forms of
      calcium channel blockers were associated with increased cardiovascular mortality,
      malignancy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. A recent meta-analysis found a
      significant increase in the risk of mortality in patients treated with a
      short-acting form of nifedipine. Another subgroup analysis of an observational
      study of older hypertensive patients found a significantly increased risk of
      cancer and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients prescribed calcium channel
      blockers. Both in vitro and small human in vitro series have reported a potential
      for cardiac toxicity in pregnant women treated concomitantly with calcium channel
      blockers and magnesium sulfate. Until additional data are available, we suggest
      that when calcium channel blockers are used in obstetrics and gynecology, the
      long-acting variety be prescribed. Concurrent use of calcium channel blockers and
      magnesium sulfate should be undertaken cautiously because of the potential for
      synergistic depression of cardiac function.

      of essential hypertension: The South African Multicenter ANCHOR Study. Ambulatory
      Nisoldipine Coat-Core Hypertension Outpatient Response (ANCHOR) Investigators.
PG  - 250-60
AB  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial was undertaken to assess
      the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a controlled-release (Coat-Core
      [CC] tablet) formulation of the second-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel
      antagonist, nisoldipine. Of the 208 patients with mild-to-moderate essential
      hypertension, two were excluded from the main efficacy analysis, and the rest
      randomized into one of four treatment groups, to receive either placebo, or
      nisoldipine CC at doses of 10, 20, or 30 mg once daily for 6 weeks, following a
      4-week placebo run-in period. Blood pressure measurements (supine, standing,
      diastolic, and systolic) were taken at trough plasma levels, 24 h after previous 
      dosing at 2-week intervals throughout the study. Adverse events and laboratory
      parameters (plasma lipid and glucose levels, and thyroid function) were
      monitored. All three doses of nisoldipine CC lowered blood pressure, as compared 
      with placebo, 24 h after dosing. At endpoint (after 6 weeks) mean changes in
      supine blood pressure from baseline were (systolic/diastolic) 0.9/-2.3,
      -8.0/-5.5, -16.9/-9.0, and -15.0/-10.3 mm Hg for the groups assigned to placebo
      and nisoldipine CC 10, 20, and 30 mg, respectively. The response rates were 35%, 
      47%, and 63% for nisoldipine CC 10, 20, and 30 mg, respectively. Twenty-four-hour
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed that nisoldipine CC effectively
      controlled blood pressure throughout the dosing interval. No change in heart rate
      was seen for all three doses of nisoldipine CC over the 24-h dosing interval.
      Nisoldipine CC was at least as effective in black patients as in whites.
      Generally adverse events were not increased, except for peripheral edema, with
      rates of 7% in placebo, and 6%, 9%, and 19%, respectively, in those receiving
      nisoldipine CC 10, 20, or 30 mg daily. There were no clinically significant
      changes in blood lipids, blood glucose, or thyroid function. In conclusion,
      once-daily nisoldipine CC at doses of 10 to 30 mg was an effective and well
      tolerated antihypertensive agent, providing 24-h control of blood pressure
      without any increase in heart rate.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers blunt postural cutaneous vasoconstriction in
      hypertensive patients.
PG  - 751-6
AB  - The aim of this work was to test whether calcium channel blockers interfere with 
      skin vasoconstrictor reflexes that minimize postural increases in capillary
      pressure and avoid fluid extravasation and eventually subcutaneous edema. Studies
      were conducted in 23 untreated mild to moderate essential hypertensives; drugs,
      either calcium channel blockers or not, were given for 2 weeks according to a
      crossover, sequence-randomized design. Skin blood flow was measured by laser
      Doppler flowmetry in two skin areas: (1) the dorsum of the foot, where
      arteriovenous anastomoses are poorly represented, and (2) the plantar surface of 
      the great toe, where those anastomoses are predominant. Determinations were
      obtained both with the foot at heart level and with it placed passively 50 cm
      below the heart level; percent flow changes from the horizontal to the dependent 
      position were the measure of postural vasoconstriction. Two dihydropyridine
      derivatives, amlodipine (10 mg UID) and nifedipine (60 mg UID), and verapamil
      (240 mg BID), a chemically unrelated compound, diminished to similar extents the 
      postural fall in skin blood flow at the dorsum of the foot. Blockade of
      alpha1-adrenergic and AT-1 subtype angiotensin II receptors by doxazosin (4 mg
      UID) and losartan (50 mg UID), respectively, exerted no effect. Postural skin
      blood flow responses at the plantar surface of the great toe were unmodified
      during the pharmacological trials. Thus, calcium channel blockers of different
      chemical origins antagonized postural skin vasoconstriction at the dorsum of the 
      foot. The data indicate altered postural capillary blood flow regulation, since
      arteriovenous anastomoses are anatomically absent at this site; the effect was
      independent of either alpha1-adrenoceptor or angiotensin II receptor antagonism. 
      Interference with skin postural vasoconstrictor mechanisms may result in net
      filtration of fluid to the extravascular compartment. This mechanism might
      explain the as yet unknown pathogenesis of ankle edema during treatment with
      calcium antagonists.

PG  - 431-5
AB  - This multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of factorial design
      evaluated the safety and efficacy of combination treatment with the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, and the vascular selective
      calcium antagonist felodipine extended release (ER) in patients with essential
      hypertension. After a 4-week, single-blind placebo baseline period, 707 patients 
      with sitting diastolic blood pressures (BPs) in the range of 95 to 115 mm Hg
      received placebo, enalapril (5 or 20 mg), felodipine ER (2.5, 5, or 10 mg), or
      their combinations for an 8-week double-blind treatment period. All doses of
      enalapril and felodipine ER had a statistically significant (p < 0.05) additive
      effect in reducing both systolic and diastolic BP. The trough to peak ratios for 
      the combinations ranged from 0.63 (enalapril 5 mg-felodipine ER 2.5 mg) to 0.79
      (enalapril 20 mg-felodipine ER 10 mg) and were consistent with effective BP
      control with 1 dose/day. Patients aged > or = 65 years demonstrated a greater
      reduction in diastolic BP. Combinations of enalapril-felodipine ER were
      associated with less drug-induced peripheral edema (4.1%) compared to felodipine 
      ER monotherapy (10.8%). There were no serious drug-related adverse effects
      observed during the study. In this trial, the combination of enalapril and
      felodipine ER effectively lowered BP and was generally well tolerated with an
      excellent safety profile when used in the treatment of hypertension.

TI  - The antihypertensive efficacy of the novel calcium antagonist mibefradil in
      comparison with nifedipine GITS in moderate to severe hypertensives with
      ambulatory hypertension.
PG  - 189-96
AB  - Mibefradil is a novel calcium antagonist that blocks selectively the T-type
      calcium channels. In this double-blind forced titration study design we compared 
      the effects of mibefradil 50, 100, and 150 mg and nifedipine GITS 30, 60, and 90 
      mg monotherapies or combined with lisinopril 20 mg in 71 moderate to severe
      hypertensives (59 men and 12 women) with confirmed ambulatory hypertension. An
      incremental dose-response effect was observed both in clinic and ambulatory blood
      pressure parameters during treatment with mibefradil and nifedipine GITS alone
      and combined with lisinopril. At maximal dosage, patients treated with mibefradil
      experienced a greater (P < .05) reduction in clinic and ambulatory diastolic
      blood pressures as well as a greater response rate (86% v 69%). Trough:peak
      ratios for systolic and diastolic blood pressures were > 90% at each dose level. 
      Significant decrease in baseline heart rate was observed with mibefradil 150 mg
      alone or combined with lisinopril, but no patients experienced clinically
      significant atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. Adverse events related to 
      vasodilation were more prevalent in the nifedipine GITS group. Consequently, the 
      results of the present study demonstrate that the novel calcium channel blocker
      mibefradil, either alone or in combination with lisinopril, is effective in
      reducing clinic and 24-h blood pressures while decreasing heart rate and is well 
      tolerated in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.

TI  - Drug-induced chest pain and myocardial infarction. Reports to a national centre
      and review of the literature.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse reports of drug-induced myocardial infarction and chest
      pain sent to a national reporting centre. To review which drugs were suspected of
      exhibiting these adverse events and what mechanisms were involved. METHODS:
      During the 20-year period 1975 through 1994, a total of 19,141 reports on adverse
      reactions to drugs were received by the Netherlands Centre for Monitoring of
      Adverse Reactions to Drugs. Of these 19,141 reports, 220 (1.1%) were concerned
      with drug-induced chest pain or myocardial infarction. After excluding reports in
      which the causal relationship was unlikely, poorly documented reports and reports
      on cases of overdosage, 183 reports (84%) were analysed. RESULTS: There were 130 
      reports (71%) of drug-induced chest pain and 53 reports (29%) of drug-induced
      myocardial infarction. A total of 104 reports concerned females (57%). The most
      frequently reported suspected drugs were the antimigraine drug sumatriptan (33
      reports, 4 concerning myocardial infarction), the calcium antagonist nifedipin (9
      reports, 2 of myocardial infarction) and nicotine [9 reports (8 patches, 1
      chewing gum), 5 concerning myocardial infarction]. There were 18 reports of a
      fatal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Several drugs can produce chest pain or myocardial
      ischaemia. It is important to recognise drugs as a potential cause, especially in
      patients with normal coronary arteries.

TI  - Twenty-four-hour blood pressure monitoring during treatment with extended-release
      felodipine versus slow-release nifedipine in elderly patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension: a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study.
PG  - 95-100
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study was designed to
      compare the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of extended-release
      felodipine and slow-release nifedipine retard in elderly hypertensive patients.
      METHODS: Thirty patients of both sexes (mean age 71 years) with mild to moderate 
      essential hypertension were recruited from our hypertension outpatient clinic.
      After a 2-week placebo period, felodipine extended-release (felodipine ER), 10 mg
      once daily, nifedipine slow-release retard (nifedipine SR), 20 mg twice daily or 
      placebo were administered to each patient for 2 weeks according to a 3 x 3
      latin-square design. At the end of each treatment period, the patients underwent 
      24-h noninvasive blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: All of the patients
      completed the trial and no serious adverse experience was reported. In comparison
      with placebo, felodipine and nifedipine decreased mean 24-h diastolic blood
      pressure by 6.7 and 4.3 mmHg, respectively, with no significant difference
      between the two drugs. Mean 24-h systolic blood pressure also decreased after
      felodipine and nifedipine, with no difference between the two drugs. Both drugs
      reduced blood pressure variability, lowering the 24-h mean standard deviation of 
      mean hourly blood pressure values. The trough:peak ratio for felodipine was 80%
      for systolic and 75% for diastolic blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Felodipine ER once
      daily lowers blood pressure in elderly hypertensives and is as effective as
      nifedipine SR twice daily. The high trough:peak ratio suggests that the dose and 
      the between-dose interval of felodipine provides adequate therapeutic coverage.

TI  - Equivalent reduction of proteinuria in hypertensives by either nifedipine GITS or
      enalapril: disparate effects on neurohormones and ambulatory blood pressure and
      the influence of salt.
PG  - 38-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the efficacy of two classes of antihypertensive therapy on
      ambulatory blood pressure control and proteinuria in patients with hypertension. 
      Furthermore, we determined the effects of the interaction of these therapies on
      neurohormonal activation and of the patients' ambient sodium intake on the
      outcomes. METHODS: Sustained-release nifedipine (nifedipine gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system, GITS) 30-120 mg/day was compared in a double-blind sequential
      randomized placebo-controlled trial with enalapril 5-30 mg/day regarding office
      and 24-hour blood pressure control, plasma renin activity, noradrenaline and
      adrenaline levels and 24-hour urinary protein and sodium in 46 elderly
      nondiabetic hypertensive patients in a 16- to 18-week trial. RESULTS: Both
      nifedipine GITS and enalapril controlled ambulatory blood pressure during the day
      and at peak effect. Nifedipine GITS controlled ambulatory blood pressure during
      the early morning surge and at night time as well. Nifedipine GITS increased
      plasma renin activity and noradrenaline by 50 and 20%, respectively, compared to 
      the 150 and 0% change produced by enalapril. Both nifedipine GITS and enalapril
      reduced proteinuria by 37%. Patients had increasing levels or proteinuria
      proportional to higher ambient sodium intake (r = 0.48; p < 0.01). This effect
      was accentuated during nifedipine GITS therapy as compared to enalapril.
      CONCLUSION: Nifedipine GITS was superior to enalapril in controlling ambulatory
      blood pressure, but they were equivalent in reducing proteinuria (37%). They had 
      disparate effects on neural activation and the duration of action. Raised protein
      excretion appears to be associated with raised sodium intake. This was apparent
      especially during nifedipine XL therapy.

PG  - 387-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the causes and mortality of poisoning in Tehran. METHODS:
      The 7000 poisoning cases referred to Loghman-Hakim Hospital in Tehran over six
      months in 1994 were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: The overall female to
      male ratio was 1.8:1. Most poisonings occurred in the age range 2-6 y for
      children and 21-40 y for adults. Oral ingestion was the most common route of
      intoxication. In children, boys had a higher frequency of poisonings than girls. 
      Most cases of children were referred to the hospital between 8 am and 8 pm. In
      adults referred to the hospital, there was little diurnal variation in poisoning 
      presentations. In adults, drugs were the most common cause of intoxication
      (60.2%). Of these, benzodiazepines (24.5%) were the most frequent, followed by
      antidepressants (20.5%) and analgesics (18%). Pesticide and opiate intoxications 
      were also commonly observed. In children, after drugs (32.1%), hydrocarbons were 
      the most frequent cause of poisoning (19.2%). Pesticide poisonings were most
      often fatal (19.2%), followed by barbiturates (18.6%) and opiates (16.2%).
      Organophosphate insecticides were responsible for 57% of total pesticide
      poisoning cases. Of the deaths, 87.5% were attributed to suicide. CONCLUSION: The
      majority of poisoning cases in adults occur intentionally and in children
      accidentally.

      felodipine in Chinese elderly hypertensive patients with or without
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 72-80
AB  - After a 4-week placebo baseline period, 29 Chinese elderly hypertensive patients 
      were randomized, double-blind, to 12 weeks of treatment with either losartan
      potassium (n = 19), an angiotensin II antagonist at the AT1 receptor, or
      felodipine (n = 10), a calcium channel blocking agent. Of these 29 patients 12
      had coexisting non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. At week 12, the mean
      reductions (95% confidence intervals) in mean arterial pressure were similar in
      both groups: losartan -18 (range -22 to -14) mm Hg; felodipine -19 (range -25 to 
      -11) mm Hg. In the whole group, the 24-hour urinary albumin excretion was reduced
      by 27% with losartan as compared with no change in the felodipine-treated group
      (p = 0.03; analysis of variance). In the diabetic group, losartan treatment
      reduced the urinary albumin excretion by 24% as compared with 11% in the
      felodipine-treated group. In the non-diabetic patients, the urinary albumin
      excretion fell by 29% in the losartan-treated group, but increased by 14% in the 
      felodipine-treated group (p < 0.001; repeated-measures analysis of variance).
      Plasma sodium increased to a similar extent in both groups. The fasting plasma
      triglyceride level declined by 25% (p < 0.001 within group) with losartan, but
      was not significantly reduced in the felodipine-treated group. For comparable
      reductions in blood pressure, a greater reduction in albuminuria was seen with
      losartan than with felodipine treatment in Chinese hypertensive patients with or 
      without non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Long-term studies are required
      to examine whether these antiproteinuric effects of losartan can be translated to
      renoprotection.

TI  - Haemostatic markers, inflammatory parameters and lipids in male and female
      patients in the Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm (APSIS). A comparison with
      healthy controls.
PG  - 59-69
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate haemostatic markers (especially fibrinolysis),
      inflammatory parameters and lipids in patients with stable angina pectoris.
      Special attention was paid to differences between male and female patients, and
      to the reactivity to exercise or the diurnal variation of certain parameters.
      SUBJECTS: Eight hundred and nine patients (31% females) and a matched healthy
      control group (n = 50). RESULTS: The patients had signs of disturbed
      fibrinolysis, with elevated plasma levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
      antigen and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity at rest, and
      attenuated responses of tPA antigen and activity to exercise. Elevated levels of 
      fibrinogen, white blood cell counts and orosomucoid were found, suggesting
      increased inflammatory activity, as well as a more disturbed lipid profile
      (higher triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol levels) than among controls.
      Female patients had higher HDL cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels than
      male patients, but higher platelet counts and signs of enhanced platelet activity
      (beta-thromboglobulin excretion). In addition, female patients had lower white
      blood cell counts, suggesting lesser inflammatory activity. CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      with stable angina pectoris have signs of markedly disturbed fibrinolysis both at
      rest and in response to exercise, as well as signs of enhanced inflammatory
      activity and dyslipidemia. The observed sex differences suggest that male
      patients with stable angina pectoris may have a more lipid-related disease,
      whereas it may be more dependent on platelet function in females.

TI  - Quinine-induced hearing loss in the guinea pig is not affected by the Ca2+
      channel antagonist verapamil.
PG  - 46-8
AB  - It is well documented that quinine induces reversible hearing loss and tinnitus. 
      The purpose in this study was to induce a quinine hearing loss and to investigate
      if verapamil, a Ca2+ channel antagonist of L-type might affect the response.
      Pigmented guinea pigs (n = 24) were anaesthetized by atropine. Hypnorm and
      midazolam but permitting spontaneous respiration. An electrode of platinum was
      placed on the round window and short (10 msec) tone pulses at 8 kHz were
      presented to the external ear. A typical deflection of the N1-wave was determined
      as the hearing threshold. Quinine hydrochloride 40 mg/kg and verapamil 1 mg/kg
      were given intravenously. Quinine induced a significant and reversible hearing
      loss (mean 16 dB). This hearing loss was not at all affected by verapamil given
      before or after quinine. Verapamil often caused acute cardiac arrest and
      particularly the combination verapamil followed by quinine-induced death to the
      animal. We conclude that verapamil and quinine had no in vivo interaction with
      regard to the hearing ability.

TI  - Long-term effects on sexual function of five antihypertensive drugs and
      nutritional hygienic treatment in hypertensive men and women. Treatment of Mild
      Hypertension Study (TOMHS)
PG  - 8-14
AB  - Problems with sexual function have been a long-standing concern in the treatment 
      of hypertension and may influence the choice of treatment regimens and decisions 
      to discontinue drugs. The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) provides
      an excellent opportunity for examination of sexual function and effects of
      treatment on sexual function in men and women with stage I diastolic hypertension
      because of the number of drug classes studied, the double-blind study design, and
      the long-term follow-up. TOMHS was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of
      902 hypertensive individuals (557 men, 345 women), aged 45 to 69 years, treated
      with placebo or one of five active drugs (acebutolol, amlodipine maleate,
      chlorthalidone, doxazosin maleate, or enalapril maleate). All participants
      received intensive lifestyle counseling regarding weight loss, dietary sodium
      reduction, alcohol reduction (for current drinkers), and increased physical
      activity. Sexual function was ascertained by physician interviews at baseline and
      annually during follow-up. At baseline, 14.4% of men and 4.9% of women reported a
      problems with sexual function. In men, 12.2% had problems obtaining and/or
      maintaining an erection; 2.0% of women reported a problem having an orgasm.
      Erection problems in men at baseline were positively related to age, systolic
      pressure, and previous antihypertensive drug use. The incidences of erection
      dysfunction during follow-up in men were 9.5% and 14.7% through 24 and 48 months,
      respectively, and were related to type of antihypertensive therapy. Participants 
      randomized to chlorthalidone reported a significantly higher incidence of
      erection problems through 24 months than participants randomized to placebo
      (17.1% versus 8.1%, P = .025). Incidence rates through 48 months were more
      similar among treatment groups than at 24 months, with nonsignificant differences
      between the chlorthalidone and placebo groups. Incidence was lowest in the
      doxazosin group but was not significantly different from the placebo group.
      Incidence for acebutolol, amlodipine, and enalapril groups was similar to that in
      the placebo group. In many cases, erection dysfunction did not require withdrawal
      of medication. Disappearance of erection problems among men with problems at
      baseline was common in all groups but greatest in the doxazosin group. Incidence 
      of reported sexual problems in women was low in all treatment groups. In
      conclusion, long-term incidence of erection problems in treated hypertensive men 
      is relatively low but is higher with chlorthalidone treatment. Effects of
      erection dysfunction with chlorthalidone appear relatively early and are often
      tolerable, and new occurrences after 2 years are unlikely. The rate of reported
      sexual problems in hypertensive women is low and does not appear to differ by
      type of drug. Similar incidence rates of erection dysfunction in placebo and most
      active drug groups caution against routine attribution of erection problems to
      antihypertensive medication.

TI  - Calcium antagonists, a useful additional therapy in treatment resistant
      hypertension: comparison of felodipine ER and nifedipine Retard by 24-h
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
PG  - 2-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of felodipine extended
      release (ER) 2.5 mg (F2.5) and 5 mg (F5) once daily with nifedipine Retard 10 mg 
      (N20) and 20 mg (N40) twice daily as additional therapy in patients who remained 
      hypertensive despite treatment with an ACE-inhibitor, beta-blocker or diuretic.
      DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multicentre, double-blind parallel study, 61 men and 54 
      women, aged 35-75, with a supine diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 115 mmHg
      were randomised to treatment with F2.5, F5, N20 or N40 for 8 weeks, with optional
      doubling of the dose after 4 weeks. Blood pressure was measured at the office
      after 0, 4 and 8 weeks and by 24-h ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) after 0 and 4
      weeks. Spontaneously reported adverse events and a subjective symptom assessment 
      questionnaire were used for side-effect profiling. RESULTS: Mean office
      systolic/diastolic blood pressure was clinically relevantly reduced in all
      treatment groups after 4 weeks by 8/7, 12/9, 11/9 and 18/11 mmHg for F2.5, F5,
      N20 and N40, respectively, and after 8 weeks (F2.5-5: 17/11 mmHg: F5-10: 18/14
      mmHg; N20-40: 19/14 mmHg; N40-80: 25/14 mmHg) with no statistically significant
      differences between these groups. The lowest dose of felodipine (F2.5) was the
      least effective. After 4 weeks the ABPM showed consistent 24-h reductions in
      blood pressure (4/2; 8/5; 7/5; 10/6 mmHg, respectively) over 24 h for the
      felodipine ER 5 mg group only and for both nifedipine groups. No statistically
      significant difference between these groups was found. An office responder does
      not appear to be identical to an ambulatory one and vice versa. The adverse
      events, mostly oedema, flushing and headache, were dose-related. CONCLUSIONS:
      Both felodipine ER and nifedipine Retard are effective "add-on' drugs in patients
      with monotherapy-resistant hypertension. The blood-pressure-lowering effect is
      dose-dependent and tolerability is inversely related to efficacy. The results
      emphasize the benefits of combining two agents with low doses.

TI  - Blood pressure and metabolic responses to moderate sodium restriction in
      isradipine-treated hypertensive patients.
PG  - 68-76
AB  - This multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial assessed the influence of
      sodium chloride intake on the antihypertensive effect of the calcium channel
      blocker isradipine. Participants with uncomplicated hypertension controlled by
      isradipine entered a 4-week sodium-restricted (60 to 80 mmol/24 h) period.
      Participants with urinary sodium levels < 120 mmol/24 h (n = 99) were randomized 
      to placebo or sodium chloride (100 mmol/24 h) for 4 weeks, and then crossed over 
      to the alternative treatment for an additional 4 weeks. Mean baseline systolic
      blood pressure was 151.9 +/- 16.7 mm Hg (mean +/- SD). During open-label
      isradipine treatment, systolic blood pressures for ad libitum sodium chloride and
      restriction were 134.1 +/- 11.1 and 132.1 +/- 12.2 mm Hg respectively; for
      double-blind sodium chloride restriction and supplementation: 133.6 +/- 12.6 and 
      138.5 +/- 12.8 mm Hg (P < .01). Urinary sodium excretion values for open-label
      isradipine ad libitum versus restricted were 140.6 +/- 61.9 versus 76.9 +/- 32.4 
      mmol/24 h; for double-blind restricted versus supplemented, sodium excretion was 
      120.5 +/- 68.9 v 175.9 +/- 68.7 mmol/24 h (P < or = .0001). Changes in urinary
      sodium excretion were not predictive of variations in blood pressure. Urinary
      sodium excretion during sodium restriction correlated directly with
      HDL-cholesterol (P < .02) and inversely with total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol (P
      = .02), despite decreased total and saturated fat intake (P < .01). Sodium
      restriction was associated with significant reductions (P < .01) in virtually all
      macronutrients and electrolytes, and thus had an adverse impact on overall
      nutrition. The antihypertensive action of isradipine was not enhanced by dietary 
      sodium chloride restriction, and the lipoprotein profile was least favorable with
      sodium chloride restriction.

TI  - Novel delivery system for verapamil designed to achieve maximal blood pressure
      control during the early morning.
PG  - 1202-6
AB  - Because the risk of cardiovascular events appears to be greatest in the early
      morning, this period is a time during which adequate blood pressure (BP) control 
      appears to be most desirable. In this study, a controlled-onset extended-release 
      system (COER-24) that delivers verapamil in a manner designed to achieve maximal 
      levels of drug during the early morning surge in BP was compared with placebo.
      Ninety-five patients with mild to moderate hypertension were studied. Of this
      group, 49 patients (mean age 57.6 +/- 1.4 years; 35 men and 14 women) were
      randomized to take verapamil COER-24 240 mg at 10 PM, and 46 subjects (mean age
      55.8 +/- 1.5 years; 29 men and 17 women) were randomized to take placebo.
      Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed after a 4-week initial placebo period and 
      was repeated after 4 weeks of treatment with verapamil or placebo. Verapamil
      COER-24 resulted in significant (p < 0.001) decreases in mean whole-day systolic 
      and diastolic BP (-8.2/-6.3 mm Hg; baseline 152/93.0 mm Hg) when compared with
      placebo (+0.3/-0.9 mm Hg; baseline 150.3/93.2 mm Hg). From 6 AM to noon,
      verapamil COER-24 resulted in a change in systolic and diastolic BP of -11.6/-9.0
      mm Hg, which was significantly (p < 0.001) greater than the change that occurred 
      with placebo (-0.5/-1.0 mm Hg) during the same period. In the last 4 hours of the
      dosing interval (6 PM to 10 PM), verapamil COER-24 caused significantly greater
      (p < 0.001) decreases in BP (-7.4/-4.8 mm Hg) than did placebo (+2.7/+1.0 mm Hg).
      These data demonstrate that the COER-24 system, when administered in the late
      evening, achieves maximal BP reduction during the early morning hours. Moreover, 
      BP reductions were sustained throughout the 24-hour period.

TI  - [Example of a phase IV trial involving several physicians and aiming at answering
      a scientific question: EOL].
PG  - 667-76
AB  - The aim of this trial was to test the hypothesis that a reduced number of doses
      improves compliance in current medical practice. Compliance with twice a day
      dosage was compared with compliance with three doses a day. Two bioequivalent
      presentations of nicardipine were used, the regular presentation (t.i.d.) and the
      slow-release (b.i.d.). The trial was controlled, randomized, open, in two
      parallel groups: (1)'t.i.d.' group: one tablet of regular nicardipine, 20 mg,
      three times a day, three months; (2) 'b.i.d.' group: one capsule of slow-release 
      nicardipine, twice a day, three months. 2651 general practitioners randomized
      7274 hypertensive patients. The primary criterion was documented in 93.7 per cent
      of the cases at the end of the trial. The remaining 6.3 per cent comprised
      treatment withdrawal (2.8 per cent) and patients lost to follow-up (3.5 per
      cent). The primary criterion study was compliance, assessed by a
      self-questionnaire filled in by the patient and a standardised interview by the
      physician. Compliance was slightly better in the b.i.d. group than in the t.i.d. 
      group (p < 0.001). Remaining pill count was also used but it was a failure. A
      random sample of investigators made on-site visits. Discordant data were
      infrequent and were limited to dates of visits. Difficulties with on-site visits 
      were mostly due to a rather frequent lack of source records.

TI  - Evaluation of enalapril/diltiazem ER in hypertensive patients with coexisting
      renal dysfunction. Enalapril/Diltiazem ER in Hypertensive Renal Disease Group.
PG  - 769-74
AB  - Both enalapril and long-acting diltiazem have been shown to effectively lower
      blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients. Furthermore, in clinical studies,
      these two agents provided beneficial renal effects in these patients when
      administered on a long-term basis. A combination of enalapril/diltiazem ER was
      evaluated in 62 patients with Stage 1-3 hypertension and coexisting renal
      disease. This trial used a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group 
      design. The study consisted of a 12-week double-blind phase followed by a 6-month
      open-label extension phase. The combination of enalapril/diltiazem ER was shown
      to reduce BP following both short-term and long-term treatment phases. Patients
      in Renal Group I (creatinine clearance CrCl): 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) had decreases
      of -18/-16 and -25/-20 mm Hg after 12 weeks and 9 months of therapy,
      respectively. Those in Renal Group II (CrCl: 10-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) had similar
      decreases of -23/-18 and -23/-19 mm Hg at these time points. The adverse events, 
      in both phases, were those associated with the respective monotherapies. A
      reduction in CrCl with a coincident decrease in proteinuria was noted for both
      renal groups. The combination of enalapril/diltiazem ER lowered BP and was
      generally well tolerated by the patients. The combination of these two agents
      should improve the management of hypertensive patients.

TI  - Treatment of patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 
      mg compared with amlodipine 5 mg, benazepril 20 mg, and placebo.
PG  - 1213-24
AB  - This multicenter, double-masked, randomized, parallel-group study compared the
      efficacy, tolerability, and safety of amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg,
      amlodipine 5 mg, benazepril 20 mg, and placebo in patients with essential
      hypertension. After a placebo run-in period, 308 patients (all white) were
      randomized to treatment groups and took medication once daily for 8 weeks. Blood 
      pressure was measured after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment in the 23- to 26-hour
      period after dosing. Patients wore a noninvasive blood pressure monitor for 24
      hours before randomization and before the final visit. Investigators recorded
      adverse experiences at randomization and at study weeks 4 and 8, and obtained
      specimens for laboratory testing at randomization and at study week 8. Three
      hundred seven patients were evaluated for efficacy, and 308 for tolerability and 
      safety. At end point (the last postrandomization measurement for each patient),
      the reduction in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure with the amlodipine 5
      mg/benazepril 20 mg treatment was statistically significantly greater than with
      any comparative therapy. The results of 24-hour monitoring showed that the
      amlodipine/benazepril treatment, unlike monotherapy, maintained the hourly mean
      diastolic blood pressure at < or = 90 mm Hg. A responder rate of 87.0% was
      observed with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg versus 67.5%, 53.3%, and 15.8%
      with amlodipine, benazepril, and placebo, respectively. This difference between
      the amlodipine/benazepril treatment group and each comparative single-agent
      treatment group was statistically significant. Drug-related adverse events
      occurred in 15.6% of patients in the amlodipine/benazepril group and in 24.7%,
      6.5%, and 11.7% of patients in the amlodipine, benazepril, and placebo groups,
      respectively. Edema occurred less often in the amlodipine/benazepril group than
      in the amlodipine group. Overall, once-daily therapy with amlodipine 5
      mg/benazepril 20 mg provided an antihypertensive effect that was statistically
      and clinically superior to amlodipine 5 mg alone, benazepril 20 mg alone, and
      placebo, was well tolerated, and was associated with less edema than the
      amlodipine treatment.

TI  - The effect of verapamil on the prevalence and severity of cyclosporine-induced
      gingival overgrowth in renal allograft recipients.
PG  - 1201-5
AB  - Cyclosporine A (CsA) and verapamil are two agents used in renal transplantation, 
      both of which are suspected of inducing gingival overgrowth. This study was
      conducted to investigate the effect of verapamil on the severity and prevalence
      of CsA-induced gingival overgrowth. Fifty-one (51) renal transplant recipients
      (total group) of whom 22 were using only CsA (Group A) and 29 of whom were
      prescribed CsA + verapamil (Group B) were evaluated for various periodontal and
      pharmacological parameters. No statistically significant differences were found
      in age, sex, plaque index, gingival index, calculus index, probing depth, CsA
      oral dose, CsA whole blood level, duration of CsA therapy, azathioprine dose, and
      prednisolone dose. Although the prevalence of the gingival overgrowth was more
      pronounced in CsA + verapamil group compared to CsA group (51.72% vs. 40.91%),
      the difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the severity of
      gingival overgrowth, although more manifest in CsA + verapamil group than CsA
      patients (34.24% vs. 28.91%), was not significantly different. Gingival
      overgrowth scores in the main group, CsA, and CsA + verapamil groups were found
      to be positively correlated to periodontal probing depths (r = 0.60, r = 0.70, r 
      = 0.52, respectively) and the gingival index (r = 0.60, r = 0.70, r = 0.54,
      respectively). CsA oral dose, whole blood level, and duration of CsA therapy were
      not found to be correlated with the gingival overgrowth in either group.
      Likewise, the dose of verapamil and the duration of verapamil therapy were not
      correlated with the gingival overgrowth in Group B. This study indicates that
      verapamil, when prescribed as the calcium channel blocker in renal transplant
      patients, has no augmenting effect on the severity and the prevalence of
      CsA-induced gingival overgrowth.

TI  - Prescribing practices for the management of headache in Newfoundland and
      Labrador.
PG  - 542-6
AB  - To assess the impact of sumatriptan in clinical practice, we undertook a
      retrospective analysis of the government of Newfoundland and Labrador's
      prescription drug program data base for 35 consecutive patients prescribed
      sumatriptan. The number of doses of all drugs prescribed ranged from 121 to
      18,874 on from 4 to 357 prescriptions per patient over 1 to 19 months. The mean
      number of doses of analgesic drugs prescribed before sumatriptan therapy was 56
      per month and after initiation of sumatriptan was 46 per month. The prescribing
      of multiple analgesics was common; 79% received three or more different
      analgesics. Twenty-two (63%) patients were prescribed medications indicated for
      the prophylaxis of migraine concomitantly with drugs indicated for symptomatic
      treatment. Twenty-four (69%) patients were prescribed medication capable of
      inducing migraine. We conclude that sumatriptan did not have a major impact on
      the outcomes of these patients judged by their use of analgesics. The simplest
      explanation is that many of the patients were suffering from analgesic-induced
      headache rather than migraine. In addition, we conclude that there were
      deficiencies in prescribing practices including numbers, quantities, and choice
      of analgesics; the use of analgesics concomitantly with drugs indicated for
      migraine prophylaxis; and the use of drugs capable of inducing migraine. Further 
      research is required to validate these findings.

TI  - Shanghai trial of nifedipine in the elderly (STONE).
PG  - 1237-45
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of nifedipine treatment in elderly
      hypertensives. METHODS: A single-blind trial was conducted under the direction of
      the Shanghai Institute of Hypertension in 1632 subjects aged 60-79 years
      alternatively allocated to either nifedipine or placebo after a 4-week placebo
      run-in period between 1987 and 1990 with mean follow-up of 30 months. Clinical
      events and risk modification were analysed in collaboration with the University
      of Montreal. Seventy-four patients with severe hypertension were reallocated to
      active nifedipine treatment after placebo run-in. RESULTS: Cox's proportional
      hazards model accounting for covariates demonstrated a highly significant
      decrease in the probability of events: 'original treatment assignment' analysis
      indicated that 77 events occurred in the placebo and 32 in the nifedipine group. 
      Similar significances were achieved with 'actual treatment' or 'changes excluded'
      (excluding reallocated subjects) analyses. A significant reduction in relative
      risk was observed for strokes and severe arrhythmia with an overall decrease from
      1.0 to 0.41 (95% confidence interval 0.27-0.61). CONCLUSION: Nifedipine treatment
      diminished the number of severe clinical outcomes in elderly hypertensives
      significantly.

AB  - Recognition of the existence of circadian variation in exacerbation of
      cardiovascular disease may have relevance to clinical use of cardioactive agents.
      Physiologic rational for the chronobiology of cardiac disease exists and can
      provide a basis on which to examine the efficacy of agents to manage cardiac
      disease. The use of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) devices
      have advanced our ability to describe the interplay of chronobiologic rhythms and
      pharmacodynamic response to antihypertensive medications. This review summarizes 
      the studies evaluating the use of various antihypertensive medications in the
      context of using 24-hour blood pressure monitoring devices. The studies are
      described in an attempt to increase awareness of chronobiology and potential
      implications of designing chronotherapeutic regimens.

      pressure monitoring.
PG  - 932-6
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if one commercial extended-release formulation of
      nifedipine (Adalat CC) is as effective as another (procardia XL) in controlling
      blood pressure over 24 hours. DESIGN: Open-label, randomized, crossover study.
      SETTING: University-affiliated family medicine clinic. PATIENTS: Fifteen patients
      with stage 1-4 primary hypertension. INTERVENTIONS: Procardia XL or Adalat CC
      once/day was titrated to achieve blood pressure control. The effective dose was
      continued for 4 weeks, washed out for 1 week, and reinstituted with other study
      drug. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure
      was recorded the conclusion of each treatment phase. Treatment phases were
      compared for mean 24-hour blood pressure, mean daytime (6:00 A.M.-10:00 P.M.) and
      mean nighttime blood pressure, and mean blood pressure load (percentage of blood 
      pressure measurements > 140/90 mm Hg daytime and > 120/80 mm Hg nighttime).
      Thirteen patients completed the study. No statistically significant difference
      was seen in mean 24-hour blood pressure (138/86 mm Hg for Procardia XL vs 137/85 
      mm Hg for Adalat CC), daytime or nighttime blood pressure, or blood pressure
      load. Two patients experienced clinically significant adverse effects while
      taking Adalat CC. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with primary hypertension,
      Adalat CC was as effective as Procardia XL at controlling blood pressure for 24
      hours. Blood pressure, heart rate, and adverse effects should be monitored 2-4
      weeks after any exchange of Adalat CC for Procardia XL.

TI  - The safety of finasteride used in benign prostatic hypertrophy: a
      non-interventional observational cohort study in 14,772 patients.
PG  - 379-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety of finasteride as used in general medical
      practice to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Information was collected on 14,772 patients who were included in an
      observational cohort study conducted using Prescription-Event Monitoring.
      RESULTS: Finasteride was reported to have been effective in 60% of the patients
      in whom an opinion on efficacy was recorded. Impotence or ejaculatory failure was
      reported in 2.1% of the patients, decreased libido in 1% and gynaecomastia and
      related conditions in 0.4%. Impotence was the most frequent reason for stopping
      treatment with finasteride and was the most commonly reported adverse reaction to
      the drug. Of the patients included in the elderly cohort involved in this study, 
      819 (5.5%) died; none of these deaths was attributed to finasteride. CONCLUSION: 
      Impotence or ejaculatory failure, decreased libido and gynaecomastia in a small
      proportion of patients were associated with the use of finasteride. The results
      of this study strongly suggest that this drug is acceptably safe when used in
      accordance with the current prescribing information.

TI  - A comparative review of the adverse effects of calcium antagonists.
PG  - 91-106
AB  - A large number of drugs within the 3 currently classes of calcium antagonists are
      in common medical use for the treatment of hypertension and ischaemic heart
      disease. The reported adverse effect profile for each of these drugs varies, but 
      tends to hold true to drug class and are typified by the adverse reactions
      reported for nifedipine and amlodipine (dihydropyridines), diltiazem
      (benzothiazepines) and verapamil (phenylalkylamines). Minor adverse effects such 
      as flushing, headache, ankle oedema, palpitations and constipation are not
      uncommon and frequently require the cessation of treatment. Of greater concern
      affecting the wide and common first-line use of calcium antagonists is the as-yet
      unresolved issue of a reportedly greater risk of myocardial infarction and death 
      following the use of short-acting nifedipine in patients with a history of
      hypertension, myocardial infarction or angina. Until this issue is fully
      resolved, it would seem prudent to limit the use of this agent in 'at-risk'
      patients and to await the results of further prospective studies before a final
      conclusion can be made.

TI  - A comparison of the antihypertensive effectiveness of a combination of moexipril 
      or sustained-release verapamil with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide.
PG  - 701-6
AB  - The antihypertensive effectiveness of moexipril, a new angiotensin-converting
      enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and sustained-release verapamil (verapamil SR) in
      combination with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide was investigated in patients with
      moderate to severe (Stages II and III) essential hypertension. Of 147 patients
      treated for 4 weeks with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day, 108 patients with sitting
      diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 100 to 114 mmHg were randomly assigned to
      receive either moexipril 7.5 mg/day (n = 56) or verapamil SR 180 mg/day (n = 52) 
      in addition to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day. After 4 weeks of treatment, doses
      of moexipril or verapamil SR were increased to 15 and 240 mg/ day respectively
      for patients with SDBP of > or = 90 mmHg. These patients were evaluated for an
      additional 8 weeks. Electrocardiograms, blood chemistries, blood counts,
      urinalysis, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone levels were monitored
      during the study. Moexipril or verapamil SR, in combination with low dose
      hydrochlorothiazide, resulted in decreased blood pressure in the sitting and
      standing positions. No correlation between blood pressure response and baseline
      plasma renin activity was demonstrated. The results of this study indicate that
      both moexipril and verapamil SR produced an additive hypertensive effect when
      added to low-dose hydrochlorothiazide. These combinations were well tolerated by 
      the patients and did not result in serious clinical and metabolic side effects.

TI  - Ultraviolet-A1 (340-400 nm) irradiation therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - 269-74
AB  - Ultraviolet-A1 (UV-A1) wavelengths have been found effective in mitigating signs 
      and symptoms of disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but
      studies have been uncontrolled. To rigorously assess the effectiveness and safety
      of daily low-dose UV-A1 irradiation as a therapeutic agent in this disorder we
      enrolled 26 women with SLE in an 18-week two-phase study. During the initial
      six-week prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, the patients were
      divided into two groups; Group A was exposed to 60kJ/m2 of UV-A1 (340-400 nm)
      irradiation within a sunbed five days a week for three weeks and Group B was
      exposed for an equal amount of time to visible light of greater than > 430 nm
      (placebo). Each group was then crossed over for exposure to the other source for 
      three weeks. During the second phase-2 weeks-patients and physicians were
      unblinded and patients were irradiated with progressively decreasing levels of
      UV-A1 only. Twenty-five patients completed the six-week placebo-controlled phase 
      of the study and eighteen patients participated for the entire 18 weeks. In Group
      A the systemic lupus activity measure (SLAM) score improved significantly after
      three weeks of five-day-a-week UV-A1 irradiation (P < 0.05), regressing to
      baseline during the three weeks of placebo irradiation. Improvement recurred and 
      progressed with six weeks of three-day-a-week UV-A1 irradiation (P < 0.05). Group
      B patients responded negligibly to the three weeks of visible light, more sharply
      to UV-A1, and as with Group A, maximally to the six weeks of three-day-a-week
      UV-A1 (P < 0.01). With twice- and then once-weekly UV-A1 irradiation the SLAM
      scores worsened slightly. All patients decreased their drug use.
      Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA) decreased significantly (P <
      0.05) and anti-nuclear antibodies non-significantly. Side effects were
      negligible. Visible light had no significant effect. In conclusion, low-dose
      UV-A1 irradiation effectively, comfortably, and without apparent toxicity
      diminished signs and symptoms of disease activity in SLE.

TI  - Relative efficacy and tolerability of lacidipine and amlodipine in patients with 
      mild-to-moderate hypertension: a randomized double-blind study.
PG  - 328-31
AB  - Calcium channel blockers are increasingly used in the treatment of hypertension. 
      Newer calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine group have longer
      elimination half-lives (t1/2) that permit once-daily dosage and are generally
      better tolerated than their parent compound. In this study, the efficacy and
      safety of lacidipine and amlodipine were compared in 65 patients with
      mild-to-moderate hypertension attending the hypertension outpatient clinic of a
      teaching hospital in a randomized double-blind cross-over trial with dose
      titration. Lacidipine and amlodipine both significantly reduced systolic blood
      pressure (SBP: by 19.2 +/- 13.5 and 22.3 +/- 15.3 mm Hg, respectively) and
      diastolic BP (DBP: 13.3 +/- 4.2 and 12.3 +/- 5.3 mm Hg, respectively) 24 h
      postdose. There were no significant differences in their antihypertensive
      effects. The incidence of adverse events (AE) was 3% for lacidipine and 8% for
      amlodipine. The incidence of withdrawal from the study due to side effects was 0%
      for lacidipine and 3% for amlodipine. These results suggest that lacidipine is
      well-tolerated, and is as effective as amlodipine as a once-daily
      antihypertensive agent.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of amlodipine and diltiazem on 24-hour blood pressure, 
      plasma catecholamines, and left ventricular mass.
PG  - 203-7
AB  - In 30 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and high-normal left 
      ventricular (LV) mass, the effects of treatment for 6 months with amlodipine (5
      to 10 mg every morning) versus diltiazem-sustained release (SR) (90 to 180 mg
      twice daily) on 24-hour blood pressure (BP), plasma catecholamines, and
      echocardiographic estimates of LV mass and function were evaluated. Both
      amlodipine and diltiazem caused stable, persistent BP reduction over 24 hours
      with no evidence for a "peak" effect. For a similar decrease in diastolic BP,
      amlodipine caused a significantly larger decrease in systolic BP. Amlodipine
      decreased BP by lowering total peripheral resistance, whereas diltiazem caused
      small decreases in both total peripheral resistance and cardiac index. Both
      calcium antagonists caused modest but significant decreases in supine and
      standing plasma catecholamines. LV wall thickness and LV mass decreased
      significantly over the 6 months of follow-up: -6 +/- 2 with diltiazem and -10 +/-
      2 g/m2 with amlodipine. In patients taking amlodipine, the decrease in LV mass
      correlated significantly with the decrease in plasma norepinephrine. In contrast 
      to rapid-acting calcium antagonists, both amlodipine and diltiazem-SR cause
      smooth BP control and an appropriate decrease in LV mass without activation of
      the sympathetic nervous system.

TI  - Trends and determinants of calcium antagonist usage after acute myocardial
      infarction (the GISSI experience).
PG  - 153-7
AB  - In the last decade, several clinical trials in patients with, or recovering from,
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have evaluated the role of calcium antagonists 
      in affecting patients' prognosis. Results have been disparate, with evidence of
      possible harm, no effect, or some benefit, depending on the agent used. We
      evaluated how the evidence from these trials has influenced the pattern of
      prescription of calcium antagonists and assessed the important determinants of
      use of these agents in patients after AMI. We analyzed retrospectively the
      prescription of calcium antagonists at discharge in all patients recovering from 
      AMI enrolled in 3 large randomized clinical trials (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio
      della Sopravvivenza nell' Infarto-1 [GISSI-1], GISSI-2, and GISSI-3) during the
      last 10 years. A progressive decrease in prescriptions for calcium antagonists
      was evident, from 47.2% in GISSI-1 to 35.1% in GISSI-2 to 19.0% in GISSI-3
      (p<0.001). The presence of post AMI angina, history of hypertension, and
      occurrence of reinfarction were associated with a higher usage of calcium
      antagonists, whereas the use of beta blockers at discharge was a major
      independent negative determinant. Use of calcium antagonists for secondary
      prevention after AMI (i.e., without specific clinical indications for their use) 
      decreased by approximately 60% (from 26.1% to 10.3%). The data indicate that the 
      usage of calcium antagonists in GISSI studies has been strongly affected by the
      results of other large multicenter trials evaluating calcium antagonists. These
      agents are now prescribed in patients after AMI almost exclusively in the
      presence of specific indications such as systemic hypertension or angina.

TI  - Calcium antagonists in the elderly. A risk-benefit analysis.
PG  - 24-36
AB  - Calcium antagonists are effective in lowering blood pressure, relieving anginal
      symptoms and improving exercise tolerance in older and younger patients with
      coronary artery disease. Verapamil and diltiazem are effective in slowing
      ventricular response rates to supraventricular arrhythmias in both older and
      younger patients. Although they belong to at least 3 distinct chemical classes, a
      moderate decrease in the clearance of all calcium antagonists occurs with aging. 
      Most clinical trials of these drugs have used the same dosages in older and
      younger patients, confounding analyses of sensitivity in older compared with
      younger patients. Greater reductions in blood pressure usually occur in older
      compared with younger patients receiving the same dosages of calcium antagonists;
      similarly, the dosage required to reduce blood pressure to a certain level is
      usually lower in older compared with younger patients. Drug acquisition costs are
      generally higher for calcium antagonists than for beta-blockers or diuretics.
      Compared with younger patients, greater heart rate suppression may be seen in
      older patients treated with verapamil and diltiazem; conversely, heart rate
      increases are usually seen with dihydropyridines. Calcium antagonists have not
      been shown to provide long-term benefits or decreased morbidity or mortality in
      elderly patients with hypertension. Verapamil, but not dihydropyridines,
      decreases mortality after myocardial infarction in patients without congestive
      heart failure. Calcium antagonists have not been shown to be beneficial in the
      treatment of acute stroke. Adverse effects, such as a postural hypotension, may
      be more frequent in elderly compared with younger patients. In addition, the
      elderly are at greater risk for drug interactions with calcium antagonists due to
      the higher likelihood that they are receiving other drugs.

TI  - Comparison of nifedipine alone and with diltiazem or verapamil in hypertension.
PG  - 109-14
AB  - Receptor binding studies suggest that combinations of calcium channel blockers
      may result in either enhanced or diminished pharmacological effects, but clinical
      data in hypertension are incomplete. In this study, we compared blood pressure
      reductions using nifedipine alone, nifedipine plus diltiazem, and nifedipine plus
      verapamil and determined whether combinations alter nifedipine pharmacokinetics. 
      After determination of baseline blood pressures. 16 subjects with essential
      hypertension (12 men, 4 women; mean age, 48 years) received 30 mg/d open-label,
      sustained release nifedipine for 2 weeks. If still hypertensive (n = 16), they
      were randomized (double-blind) to receive either additional sustained release
      diltiazem or sustained release verapamil, both 180 mg/d, for 2 weeks and were
      then crossed-over for the final 2 weeks of the study. All medications were
      once-daily, extended-release formulations. Blood pressures and nifedipine plasma 
      concentrations were measured during the final day of each treatment. Overall,
      each combination lowered mean systolic and diastolic pressures more than
      nifedipine alone. Mean supine diastolic pressures were significantly lower at 8
      hours (77.6 versus 84.6 mm Hg, P = .001) and 12 hours (81.5 versus 87.1 mm Hg, P 
      = .04) with nifedipine plus diltiazem than nifedipine plus verapamil. Mean
      nifedipine concentrations were inversely correlated with mean blood pressures.
      Mean nifedipine area under the curve values were greater with diltiazem than
      verapamil (1430 versus 1134 ng.h/mL, P = .026), with each greater than nifedipine
      alone (957 ng.h/mL). Nifedipine plus diltiazem had a greater antihypertensive
      effect than nifedipine plus verapamil. Diltiazem caused greater increases in
      nifedipine plasma concentrations than did verapamil. These data suggest that
      combined calcium channel blockers result in additive antihypertensive effects,
      perhaps because of a pharmacokinetic interaction.

TI  - Comparison of nifedipine GITS and hydrochlorothiazide in the management of
      elderly patients with stage I-III diastolic hypertension.
PG  - 598-606
AB  - A randomized, double blind, parallel study was performed to compare the effects
      of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) to hydrochlorothiazide
      (HCTZ) in the management of the elderly hypertensive. Eighteen patients, mean age
      65 +/- 5 years, with Stage I-III diastolic hypertension (sitting diastolic BP
      between 90 and 115 mm HG) were included in each treatment group. Following a 2 to
      8 week placebo washout phase, patients received either nifedipine GITS or HCTZ
      and were titrated over 5 weeks to achieve a goal diastolic blood pressure less
      than 90 mm Hg. Patients were then continued on medication during an 8 week
      maintenance phase. Treatment effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 
      assessed. Serum electrolytes, lipids, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were
      measured before and after treatment. Posttreatment changes in renal and
      cardiovascular function, as well as left ventricular mass were evaluated. The
      results showed significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure
      with both drugs; no treatment difference was found, although goal blood pressure 
      was achieved more rapidly with nifedipine GITS (28 v 34 days, P < .05). BUN was
      significantly increased only after diuretic therapy (P < .01) and serum potassium
      fell to a greater degree with HCTZ (0.3 mEq/L v 0.1 mEq/L) than with nifedipine
      GITS. No statistically significant changes in left ventricular mass, ejection
      fraction, glomerular filtration rate, or renal blood flow were seen after therapy
      with either drug. However, the time peak LV diastolic filling rate decreased with
      nifedipine GITS (197 to 164 msec) and increased with HCTZ (172 to 198 msec). This
      treatment difference approached statistical significance (P = .07). Adverse side 
      effects of treatment were reported by 50% of nifedipine GITS patients and 28% of 
      patients treated with HCTZ. This treatment difference was not statistically
      significant. We conclude that both nifedipine GITS and HCTZ monotherapy provide
      significant blood pressure reduction in older hypertensives with Stage I-III
      diastolic hypertension. Both drugs are well tolerated with no significant adverse
      effect on renal or cardiovascular function after short term therapy.

AB  - Antihypertensive Efficacy and Tolerability of Isradipine in Patients with Severe 
      Hypertension/Results of an open multicenter study. In this open multicentre study
      55 patients (mean age 51.2 years) with severe hypertension (diastolic blood
      pressure > 115 mmHg) were treated for seven weeks with the calcium antagonist of 
      the dihydropyridine type isradipine (CAS 75695-93-1, Lomir). If necessary,
      metoprolol or enalapril were added to the regimen. Before inclusion into the
      active treatment phase, responsiveness of the patients to a single administration
      of isradipine (5 mg) was compared with placebo. Preexisting antihypertensive
      therapy (18 patients) was to be maintained during the study period. Blood
      pressure was recorded with an automatic device. During the 7-week period blood
      pressure decreased from 173.7/124.8 mmHg to 143.2/97.8 mmHg. Both the group with 
      isradipine monotherapy (n = 32) and the combination group (n = 11) showed a
      significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Diastolic blood
      pressure response, defined as a decline of more than 15 mmHg, was noted in 87.5% 
      (monotherapy) and 72.7% (combination group) of patients. On the whole, blood
      pressure was normalized in 27.9% of the participants. Nineteen patients
      experienced 43 adverse events, most of which were rated mild to moderate. Therapy
      was withdrawn in only one patient (due to ankle edema). The most frequent adverse
      event was headache (20.9%).

TI  - Effectiveness and safety of diltiazem or lisinopril in treatment of hypertension 
      after heart transplantation. Results of a prospective, randomized multicenter
      trail.
PG  - 1707-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness and
      safety of diltiazem or lisinopril for treatment of hypertension after heart
      transplantation. BACKGROUND: Systemic hypertension is common after heart
      transplantation, and to date there are no randomized, prospective multicenter
      treatment trials. METHODS: Members of the Cardiac Transplant Research Database
      Group developed and implemented a prospective, randomized multicenter trial of
      the effectiveness and safety of diltiazem or lisinopril in the treatment of
      hypertension in cyclosporine-treated patients after heart transplantation.
      RESULTS: One hundred sixteen patients with hypertension (blood pressure > or =
      140/90 mm Hg) after heart transplantation were randomized for > or = 3 months of 
      treatment. Of 55 diltiazem-treated patients, 21 (38%) were responders (diastolic 
      blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), 23 (42%) were nonresponders (diastolic blood pressure
      > or = 90 mm Hg), and 11 (20%) were withdrawn from the study. Of 61
      lisinopril-treated patients, 28 (46%) were responders, 22 (36%) were
      nonresponders, and 11 (18%) were withdrawn. There was no difference in baseline
      characteristics or percent responders between the two groups. Systolic pressure
      decreased from 157 +/- 2.3 to 130 +/- 2.0 mm Hg (mean +/- 1 SEM) in the
      diltiazem-treated responders and from 153 +/- 2.1 to 127 +/- 2.7 mm Hg in the
      lisinopril-treated responders (p < 0.0001). Diastolic pressure decreased from 100
      +/- 0.9 to 85 +/- 1.6 mm Hg in the diltiazem-treated responders and from 100 +/- 
      1.0 to 84 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in the lisinopril-treated responders (p < 0.0001). There 
      were a total of 35 reported adverse events, 22 of which led to withdrawal of the 
      patient from the study. All drug-related side effects were considered minor and
      resolved with discontinuation of the drug. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate
      that both diltiazem and lisinopril are safe for treatment of hypertension after
      heart transplantation, although titrated monotherapy with either drug controlled 
      the condition in < 50% of patients.

TI  - Long-term effects on plasma lipids of diet and drugs to treat hypertension.
      Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) Research Group.
PG  - 1549-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: - To compare long-term plasma lipid changes among 6 antihypertensive
      treatment interventions for stage I (mild) hypertension. DESIGN: - Multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial. SETTING: - Four academic
      clinical research units in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: - A total of 902 men 
      and women, aged 45 to 69 years, with stage I diastolic hypertension (diastolic
      blood pressure <100 mm Hg), recruited from 11914 persons screened in their
      communities. INTERVENTIONS: - Participants were randomized to 1 of 6 treatment
      groups: (1) placebo, (2) beta-blocker (acebutolol), (3) calcium antagonist
      (amlodipine), (4) diuretic (chlorthalidone), (5) alpha1-antagonist (doxazosin),
      and (6) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril). All groups received 
      intensive lifestyle counseling to achieve weight loss, dietary sodium and alcohol
      reduction, and increased physical activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: - Changes in
      plasma total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides from baseline to annual visits
      through 4 years. RESULTS: - Mean changes in all plasma lipids were favorable in
      all groups. The degree of weight loss with fat-modified diet and exercise was
      significantly related to favorable lipid changes. Significant differences (P<.01)
      among groups for average changes during follow-up in each lipid were observed.
      Decreases in plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were greater with
      doxazosin and acebutolol (for plasma total cholesterol, 0.36 and 0.30 mmol/L
      [13.8 and 11.7 mg/dL], respectively), less with chlorthalidone and placebo (0.12 
      and 0.13 mmol/L [4.5 and 5.1 mg/dL], respectively). Decreases in triglycerides
      were greater with doxazosin and enalapril, least with acebutolol. Increases in
      HDL cholesterol were greater with enalapril and doxazosin, least with acebutolol.
      Significant relative increases in plasma total cholesterol with chlorthalidone
      compared with placebo at 12 months were no longer present at 24 months and
      beyond, when mean plasma total cholesterol for the chlorthalidone group fell
      below baseline. Analyses of participants continuing to receive chlorthalidone
      throughout the 4 years of follow-up indicated this was not due solely to an
      increasing percentage of participants changing or discontinuing use of medication
      during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: - Weight loss with a fat-modified diet plus
      increased exercise produces favorable long-term effects on blood pressure and all
      plasma lipid fractions of adults with stage I hypertension; blood pressure
      reduction is enhanced to a similar degree by addition of a drug from any one of 5
      classes of antihypertensive medication. These drugs differ quantitatively in
      influencing the degree of long-term favorable effects on blood lipids obtained
      with nutritional-hygienic treatment.

TI  - Verapamil: a review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in
      coronary artery disease.
PG  - 792-819
AB  - Verapamil has well proven efficacy in the treatment of patients with
      hypertension, and early studies indicated its efficacy in the treatment of
      coronary artery disease. The efficacy of verapamil relative to placebo in
      patients with stable angina pectoris is confirmed, and the drug is at least as
      effective as nifedipine, propranolol or metoprolol and of similar efficacy to
      bepridil and nicardipine when administered as a conventional or sustained release
      formulation. Verapamil is the first calcium antagonist to be shown in a
      double-blind study to significantly reduce mortality and reinfarction rate after 
      acute myocardial infarction in patients without heart failure. In these patients,
      the reduction in mortality achieved with verapamil was similar to that reported
      with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, suggesting that verapamil may be a suitable
      alternative to beta-blockers as secondary prevention in patients intolerant of
      these drugs. Recurrence of stenosis in patients who successfully undergo
      percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) limits the usefulness of
      the procedure. Verapamil has recently been shown to significantly reduce the rate
      of restenosis in patients with stable angina at risk of recurrence, although
      these initial results require confirmation. Verapamil, therefore, is effective in

TI  - Nifedipine and captopril exert divergent effects on heart rate variability in
      patients with acute episodes of hypertension.
PG  - 327-32
AB  - Acute changes of heart rate variability (HRV) depict alterations in autonomic
      influences on cardiovascular system and often precede ventricular arrhythmias.
      The aim of the study was to assess effects of sublingual 10 mg nifedipine (n =
      15) or 25 mg captopril (n = 13) on HRV in consecutive patients admitted to
      hospital due to severe hypertension. HRV was calculated on-line from 300 cardiac 
      cycles before and 60-90 min after drug administration. At baseline systolic blood
      pressure (SBP) was > 190 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 110 mm Hg.
      Both agents caused similar reduction of blood pressure (BP). Nifedipine reduced
      variance (-63 +/- 6%; P < 0.0001) and high-frequency (HF) component (-72 +/- 8%; 
      P < 0.0001), and increased both LF/HF ratio (+870 +/- 336%; P < 0.02) and heart
      rate (+14 +/- 3%; P < 0.0001). Captopril exerted different effects: variance and 
      HF component increased by +176 +/- 55%; (P < 0.007) and +126 +/- 44% (P < 0.015),
      respectively. LF/HF (low/high frequency) ratio decreased (-44 +/- 19%; P < 0.04) 
      together with heart rate (-4 +/- 1%; < 0.009). It is concluded that captopril, in
      contrast to nifedipine, increases HRV and decreases LF/HF ratio and therefore is 
      a better choice in hypertensive patients who might be prone to dangerous
      arrhythmias.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers in the dock: innocent or guilty?
PG  - 277-80
AB  - Several studies have recently been published which have raised doubts over the
      long-term safety of calcium channel blockers (CCB). These have included
      retrospective case control studies in hypertension and meta-analyses of small
      scale studies in unstable angina and myocardial infarction (MI). Most of the
      reports were primarily concerned with the use of the short acting dihydropyridine
      nifedipine. Despite wide media coverage of these reports, the results are by no
      means irrefutable and, because of the nature of the studies themselves, are open 
      to several criticisms. Calcium channel blockers are currently being evaluated in 
      large-scale, prospective, randomised controlled studies, but results are unlikely
      to be available within the next few years. Meanwhile, the consensus view seems to
      be that short acting dihydropyridines should in general be avoided and have no
      place in the management of unstable angina and post MI. In the setting of stable 
      angina, long acting dihydropyridines should generally be used in conjunction with
      a beta-blocker. In hypertensive patients, long acting dihydropyridines may be
      used as alternative antihypertensive agents in patients in whom the first line
      agents (diuretics and beta-blockers) are poorly tolerated, contra-indicated or
      ineffective.

TI  - Metabolic neutrality of combined verapamil-trandolapril treatment in contrast to 
      beta-blocker-low-dose chlortalidone treatment in hypertensive type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 669-77
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the metabolic, antihypertensive and
      albuminuria-modifying effects of a heart rate-modulating calcium
      antagonist-angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor combination compared with
      those of a beta-blocker-low-dose diuretic combination in non-insulin-dependent
      diabetic hypertensives. DESIGN: A prospective randomized double-blind study.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four diabetics with diastolic blood pressure 90-115 
      mmHg without azotemia (plasma creatinine level < 150 mumol/l) were evaluated
      after 4 weeks receiving placebo and 12 weeks receiving treatment either with
      combined slow-release verapamil (retard formulation) and trandolapril (mean
      maintenance doses, 180 and 1.6 mg daily) or with atenolol and chlortalidone (71
      and 18 mg daily). Insulin sensitivity (by the minimal model method of Bergman),
      additional metabolic variables, clinic blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure 
      profile and renal indices were assessed at the end of the placebo and active
      treatment phases. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, the two therapies produced
      similar decreases in mean supine clinic blood pressure [10 +/- 3 versus 11 +/- 3%
      (means +/- SEM)], upright clinic blood pressure (10 +/- 4 versus 11 +/- 4%) and
      ambulatory daytime blood pressure (9 +/- 2 versus 12 +/- 3%). However, although
      the verapamil-trandolapril combination was found to be metabolically neutral, the
      atenolol-chlortalidone combination aggravated insulin resistance [insulin
      sensitivity index, from (0.8 +/- 0.2) to (0.3 +/- 0.1) x 10(-4)/min per U per
      ml], increased the serum triglycerides level and decreased the high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol and plasma potassium levels. Although both therapies
      tended to reduce 24 h albuminuria, this was significant for the
      verapamil-trandolapril treatment only. CONCLUSIONS: Because the effect of any
      antihypertensive drug, including diuretics and beta-blockers, on cardiovascular
      morbidity and on mortality in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients is not
      known, rational treatment selection can presently be based only on surrogate
      end-points. Therefore, the triad of metabolic neutrality with antihypertensive
      and antiproteinuric efficacy supports combined verapamil-trandolapril as a
      potentially valuable therapy for hypertension accompanying diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Trough:peak ratio of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system and
      nifedipine retard in essential hypertensive patients: an Italian multicentre
      study.
PG  - 661-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antihypertensive effect of nifedipine gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system and retard in terms of trough:peak ratio efficacy. METHODS:
      According to a double-blind, randomized, crossover design, 58 patients with
      mild-to-moderate essential hypertension, after 1 month placebo washout, received 
      30 mg/day nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system, 20 mg nifedipine retard
      twice a day and the corresponding placebos for 1 month. At the end of each
      treatment period, blood pressure was measured by using a mercury sphygmomanometer
      at trough and 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after the last dosing. The peak effect was
      identified as the maximum decrement induced by the three randomized treatments
      with respect to the value at the end of the placebo washout period during the 4 h
      interval. The trough:peak ratios of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were
      calculated as group ratios and individual ratios from decrements induced by
      nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system and retard, corrected for those
      induced by randomized placebo. Patients were defined as responders to each
      randomized treatment if their diastolic blood pressure at trough time was reduced
      by at least 10 mmHg relative to that at the corresponding time at the end of
      placebo washout. RESULTS: Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system and
      retard significantly reduced blood pressure to a similar extent both at trough
      and at peak. Systolic and diastolic group trough:peak ratios in responders to
      nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (n = 41) were 0.80 and 0.88,
      respectively, and those in responders to nifedipine retard (n = 30) 0.84 and
      0.93, respectively. The percentage of patients with trough:peak ratios > 0.50 was
      > 80% (systolic trough:peak ratios) and above 90% (diastolic trough: peak ratios)
      for both nifedipine formulations. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that 30 mg/day
      nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system and 20 mg nifedipine retard twice 
      a day have a favourable trough:peak ratios efficacy when given as monotherapy to 
      essential hypertensive patients.

TI  - [Multicenter comparative study of felodipine-ER and nifedipine-OROS in the
      treatment of mild-to-moderate arterial hypertension].
PG  - 247-51
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and tolerance of felodipine-ER and nifedipine
      OROS, both once daily, in the treatment of mild-to-moderate uncomplicated
      arterial hypertension (AH). METHODS: This was a multicentric, opened, randomized,
      paralled trial, that selected 121 patients with uncomplicated, mild to moderate
      essential AH (diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 95 and < or = 110 mmHg; not
      under anti-hypertensive medication. All patients received placebo for two weeks. 
      After that period, they would take either 5mg/day of felodipine, or 30mg/day of
      nifedipine OROS, both once daily, in a randomized fashion. Patients underwent
      laboratory tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) at the begining and at the end of
      the study, and heart rate and blood pressure (BP) measurements, nearly 24 hours
      after the last active drug dose. RESULTS: Completed the study 111 patients, 60 in
      the felodipine group and 51 in the nifedipine group. Compared to baseline, the
      average of systolic BP and DBP decreased from 162.5 +/- 14.3mmHg and from 102.2
      +/- 5.1mmHg to 143.3 +/- 14.6 and 87.9 +/- 7.2mmHg, respectively, at the end of
      the treatment in the felodipine group; and from 160.5 +/- 16.3mmHg and 102.5 +/- 
      6.2mmHg to 136.1 +/- 14.2 and 86.7 +/- 7.0mmHg, respectively in nifedipine group 
      (p < 0.0001 for all diferences). Adequate BP response to the treatment (DBP
      normalization or reduction > 10mmHg from baseline) occured in 47/60 (78.3%)
      patients in the felodipine group and in 38/51 (74.5%) in the nifedipine group
      (NS). Side effects, occured in approximately 15% of the cases, and were similar
      in both groups. These were usually moderate and transient, but were responsible
      for the withdrawal from the study of two cases in the felodipine group and of
      three cases in the nifedipine group. CONCLUSION: Felodipine-ER and nifedipine
      OROS, are similarly effective and generally well tolerated in patients with
      mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.

TI  - Comparison of once daily and twice daily nisoldipine as monotherapy in essential 
      hypertension.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - Twenty-four patients completed a dose ranging study of the effect of nisoldipine 
      as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension. This randomized double-blind
      study consisted of two crossover phases in each of which once and twice daily
      treatment were compared. In the first treatment phase the total daily dose of
      nisoldipine was 10 mg, which increased to 20 mg during the second phase. Trough
      blood pressure measurements were made 12/24 h postdose. During the first phase
      the blood pressure values following treatment with nisoldipine 5 mg twice daily
      were significantly lower than with 10 mg once daily. However, when the daily dose
      was increased to 20 mg there was no significant difference between the two
      treatment regimens. There was also no significant difference between nisoldipine 
      5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily but the results for 20 mg once daily were 
      significantly lower than for 10 mg once daily. Four patients withdrew from the
      study because of adverse events, one while on placebo and three while on
      nisoldipine therapy. Between 33 percent and 47 percent of patients reported
      adverse events during nisoldipine treatment but the majority of adverse events
      reported were mild and did not require treatment withdrawal. Nisoldipine twice
      daily appeared to be more effective and better tolerated than once daily
      treatment for 24-h blood pressure control.

TI  - The Diltiazem Different Doses Study--a dose-response study of once-daily
      diltiazem therapy for hypertension.
PG  - 469-75
AB  - The objective was to evaluate the dose-related efficacy/tolerance profile of 240,
      300, 360, and 420 mg diltiazem slow-release, once-daily (OD) doses, with emphasis
      on the 300 mg dose. The study was randomized and double-blinded with a 36-week
      parallel, two-branched, cross-over design after a single-blind, run-in period of 
      4 weeks on placebo and 6 weeks on 300 mg diltiazem OD. Each branch included six
      6-week active treatment periods with 180, 240, and 300 mg tablets, one or two
      tablets OD. Participants were men and postmenopausal women, aged 40-70 years,
      with uncomplicated primary hypertension (WHO stages I and II) and a supine
      diastolic blood pressure of 95-115 mm Hg in the absence of antihypertensive
      medication. A total of 138 patients from various clinics participated in the
      study. All were included in the intention to treat analysis, and 117 patients
      were included in the per protocol analysis. Criteria for evaluation were blood
      pressure, heart rate, and response rate, as well as plasma diltiazem and
      metabolite M1 concentration before morning dose. Well-being of the patients and
      adverse events were recorded. Electrocardiogram and standard laboratory tests
      were obtained. Analysis of variance was used for statistical calculations. Supine
      blood pressures and response rates in the per protocol analysis were 161.2/97.0
      for placebo (29.1%), 155.2/ 92.8 for 240 mg (54.7%), 153.8/91.6 for 300 mg
      (55.6%), 155.5/92.0 for 360 mg (59.0%), and 152.0/90.5 for 420 mg (63.2%) of
      diltiazem OD. The intention to treat analysis was very similar to the per
      protocol analysis. There was a small but statistically significant decrease in
      heart rate for all doses of diltiazem OD compared to placebo. A linear
      relationship existed between the dose and the plasma concentration of both
      diltiazem and metabolite M1, as well as a dose-response relationship. Diltiazem
      OD in the dose range 240-420 mg was generally well tolerated and not differently 
      perceived from the placebo treatment except for ankle edema (2-6%). The study
      shows that OD diltiazem is significantly superior to placebo for mild to moderate
      hypertension and that the effect is large enough to be clinically valuable. It
      also shows that there is a linear dose-response relationship for diltiazem
      between 240 and 420 mg.

TI  - Sex- and age-related antihypertensive effects of amlodipine. The Amlodipine
      Cardiovascular Community Trial Study Group.
PG  - 713-22
AB  - This community-based study assessed whether there were age, sex, or racial
      differences in response to amlodipine 5 to 10 mg once daily in patients with mild
      to moderate essential hypertension. This prospective, open-label trial had a
      2-week placebo period, a 4-week upward drug titration/efficacy period, and a
      12-week drug maintenance period. There were 1,084 evaluable patients (mean age
      55.5 years; 65% men and 35% women; 79% white and 21% black; 75% <65 and 25% > or 
      = 65 years old). At the end of the titration/efficacy phase, the mean +/- SD
      blood pressure (BP) decreased by -16.3 +/- 12.3/-12.5 +/- 5.9 mm Hg, (p < or =
      0.0001). Amlodipine produced a goal BP response (sitting diastolic BP < or = 90
      mm Hg, or a 10 mm Hg decrease) in 86.0% of patients overall. The BP response was 
      greater in women (91.4%) than in men (83.0%, p < or = 0.001), and greater in
      those > or = 65 years old (91.5%) than in those < 65 years old (84.1%, p < or =
      0.01); however, it was similar between whites and blacks (86.0% vs 85.9%,
      respectively, p = NS). The sex difference in BP response could not be fully
      explained by differences in age, weight, dose (mg/kg), race, baseline BP, or
      compliance, and there were no differences among women based on use of hormone
      replacement therapy. Amlodipine was well tolerated; mild to moderate edema was
      the most common adverse effect. Thus, amlodipine was effective and safe as
      once-a-day monotherapy in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in a
      community-based population. Women had a greater BP response to amlodipine.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of serum amlodipine level in patients with angina pectoris.
PG  - 205-9
AB  - Serum amlodipine levels were determined in 18 patients with vasospastic angina.
      Patients were divided into two groups: Group A (n = 9) received amlodipine 5 mg
      by single daily administration, and Group B (n = 9) received 10 mg given by
      single daily administration for the first 3 days, then 5 mg from the 4th day on. 
      The serum amlodipine concentration in Group A took 7 days to reach a steady state
      of around 8 ng/ml. The level in Group B was 8.9 ng/ml at 3 days. From these
      results, the optimal dosage of amlodipine in the treatment of angina pectoris is 
      10 mg for the initial 3 days followed by 5 mg thereafter.

TI  - Decreased blood viscosity and serum levels of erythropoietin after
      anti-hypertensive treatment with amlodipine or metoprolol: results of a
      cross-over study.
PG  - 199-205
AB  - The increased viscosity of blood of hypertensive patients can be assumed to be a 
      risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the
      present study was to elucidate whether anti-hypertensive treatment has any impact
      on blood rheology. Twenty patients with previously untreated hypertension who
      consecutively attended our outpatient hypertension clinic were included in this
      prospective, open, cross-over study. The patients were randomly selected to
      treatment with amlodipine or metoprolol. The anti-hypertensive therapy was
      switched after 4 months. Haemorheological and haemodynamic variables were
      measured with rotational viscometry and impedance cardiography, respectively.
      Fifteen and 16 patients could be evaluated after amlodipine or metoprolol
      treatment respectively. The mean blood pressure (BP) decreased from 159 +/-
      22/105 +/- 7 to 139 +/- 21/91 +/- 6 mm Hg on amlodipine and from 162 +/- 22/104
      +/- 5 to 145 +/- 24/90 +/- 8 mm Hg on metoprolol therapy. After amlodipine
      treatment, the total peripheral resistance index decreased whereas metoprolol
      treatment was accompanied by a decrease in the cardiac index. Decreases in whole 
      blood viscosity, haematocrit and serum erythropoietin were found after amlodipine
      as well as metoprolol treatment. After amlodipine the plasma viscosity decreased 
      and the erythrocyte deformability increased in the majority of patients. Plasma
      fibrinogen decreased after metoprolol treatment. Despite the differences in
      haemodynamic mechanisms underlying the decrease in BP, amlodipine and metoprolol 
      exert beneficial effects on blood viscosity. Haemodilution and a decrease in
      serum erythropoietin may be factors underlying this decrease in blood viscosity.

TI  - A study of the efficacy of felodipine given once or twice daily in the management
      of elderly hypertensive patients.
PG  - 193-7
AB  - The use of medication given once daily in clinical practice may lead to
      inadequate control of blood pressure (BP) over 24 h because medication is
      frequently titrated at the time of peak effect. Twenty-three patients aged 65-84 
      completed a study in which they received placebo, felodipine 2.5 mg once daily,
      felodipine 2.5 mg 12-hourly, and felodipine 5 mg once daily in a randomized,
      double-blind crossover design. BP response was assessed in the clinic 24 h after 
      medication and by 24 h ambulatory monitoring. The trough/peak ratio was defined
      as the fall in BP in the 23rd and 24th hour post dose divided by the fall in BP
      in the 3rd and 4th hour post dose. BP fell with all three regimes and the clinic 
      BPs did not differ from each other but were lower than placebo. Peak BP responses
      from the ambulatory BP monitor recording were similar with each dose but a
      greater percentage of the effect was maintained prior to the morning dose with
      2.5 mg 12 hourly and 5 mg once daily. Felodipine 2.5 mg once daily reduces BP and
      in some people this effect persists for 24 h. However if this dose is used BP
      should be measured prior to the dose of the drug to ensure that 24 h control is
      maintained. Felodipine 5 mg once daily and felodipine 2.5 mg b.d. were equally
      effective at maintaining control and there was no significant advantage in using 
      the twice daily regime. If felodipine 5 mg once daily or higher doses are used BP
      can be titrated post dose with the knowledge that more than 75% of the effect
      will still be present prior to the next dose of the drug. Thus once daily
      felodipine extended release (ER) 5 mg or more can be used effectively to maintain
      BP control over 24 h in clinical practice. In some elderly patients felodipine ER
      2.5 mg once daily is an adequate regime.

TI  - Greater reduction of urinary albumin excretion in hypertensive type II diabetic
      patients with incipient nephropathy by lisinopril than by nifedipine.
PG  - 185-92
AB  - A double-blind, randomised, parallel group, multicentre, multinational study
      compared the effects of 12 months' treatment with lisinopril (10-20 mg once
      daily) or nifedipine retard tablets (20-40 mg twice daily) in 239 males (aged
      18-75 years) and 96 post-menopausal females (aged 40-75 years). They all had a
      history of clinically stable type II diabetes > 3 months, microalbuminuria and
      early diabetic nephropathy (a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate ranging from
      20 to 300 micrograms/min) and a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90-100 mm 
      Hg (Korotkoff phase V) inclusive at both entry and after 3-4 weeks' placebo
      treatment. The aim of treatment was to achieve a reduction in sitting DBP to < 90
      mm Hg 24-30 h after the last dose of lisinopril or 12-18 hours after the last
      dose of nifedipine and to evaluate the effect of these treatments on UAE over 12 
      months. The effect of the two treatments on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) was
      also evaluated in a subset of patients. Management of diabetes with oral
      hypoglycaemic drugs, diet and insulin alone or in combination was permitted.
      Median UAE fell on lisinopril from 65.5 (range 20-297) micrograms/min at baseline
      to 39.0 (2-510) micrograms/min after 12 months. On nifedipine median UAE fell
      from 63.0 (range 20-289) micrograms/min at baseline to 58.0 (9-1192)
      micrograms/min after 12 months. The estimated median difference between the
      effects of the two treatments was 20 micrograms/min (P = 0.0006). Over 12 months 
      both treatments produced similar falls in sitting BP from 163 +/- 17/99 +/- 6 mm 
      Hg (mean +/- s.d.) to 147 +/- 18/88 +/- 10 mm Hg for lisinopril and from 161 +/- 
      18/97 +/- 5 mm Hg to 150 +/- 18/88 +/- 9 mm Hg for nifedipine. Ambulatory BP was 
      assessed in a subset of patients and using areas under the BP-time curve (AUC) a 
      comparison of the effects of the two treatments showed no between-treatment
      differences. Creatinine clearance, glycaemic control (HbA1c) and lipid profiles
      did not change significantly during either treatment. Frequency of withdrawals
      and adverse events were similar for both treatments. We conclude that lisinopril 
      has a significantly more beneficial effect on UAE than nifedipine despite similar
      effects on both BP and glycaemic control in type II diabetic patients with
      hypertension.

TI  - Stress-induced hemodynamic and hemostatic changes in patients with systemic
      hypertension: effect of verapamil.
PG  - 205-11
AB  - Stress-induced hemodynamic and hemostatic responses may acutely trigger
      atherosclerotic plaque disruption and thrombosis leading to myocardial
      infarction. This study was designed to evaluate the responses to three stressors 
      and to determine if once-daily sustained release verapamil (Verelan) modified
      these responses. We studied 13 patients with mild to moderate hypertension in a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. After 4 weeks of
      therapy, patients were evaluated following assumption of the upright posture,
      mental stress, and cold pressor test. During placebo, the stressors produced an
      increase in systolic pressure (144 +/- 2 to 167 +/- 3 mmHg, p < 0.001), heart
      rate (70 +/- 2 to 77 +/- 2 beats/ min, p < 0.001), and platelet aggregability to 
      adenosine diphosphate (threshold concentration fell from 2.8 +/- 0.4 to 1.9 +/-
      0.1 microM, p = 0.05) and epinephrine (3.4 +/- 0.9 to 1.6 +/- 0.6 microM, p <
      0.001). Verapamil lowered systolic pressure at baseline (144 +/- 2 to 134 +/- 2
      mmHg, p < 0.001), and after stress (167 +/- 3 to 154 +/- 3 mmHg, p < 0.001), but 
      did not alter the absolute increase with stress. During verapamil, platelet
      reactivity did not increase with stress, and the post-stress response to
      epinephrine was reduced (higher threshold concentration) compared with placebo
      (3.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.3 microM, p = 0.05). Verapamil also reduced the
      response to collagen (increased lag time) at baseline and after stress (111 +/- 9
      vs. 91 +/- 3 s, p < 0.01). We conclude that verapamil blunted potentially harmful
      stress-induced hemodynamic and hemostatic changes. Further studies are required
      to determine whether these effects translate into a lower incidence of acute
      cardiovascular events.

TI  - Bezoars: implicated drugs and avoidance strategies.
PG  - 85-93
AB  - A wide variety of drugs or combinations of drugs have the potential to form
      bezoars. In the majority of patients presenting with bezoars there is a clear
      predisposing factor. This article highlights those drugs or groups of drugs which
      have been implicated in bezoar formation. Although bezoars are rare, it is
      important that the clinician is aware of the possibility of their development,
      particularly in susceptible individuals. This is because bezoars often develop in
      the elderly and in those with serious coexistent disease. They may be difficult
      to diagnose and recourse to laparotomy is frequently required to treat them. As a
      result, they are associated with a significant morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Persistence of anti-hypertensive effect after 'missed doses' of calcium
      antagonist with long (amlodipine) vs short (diltiazem) elimination half-life.
PG  - 83-8
AB  - 1. Calcium antagonists with long vs short elimination half-life may show marked
      differences in their antihypertensive effect during short interruptions of
      therapy by missed doses. 2. In the present study we evaluated the blood pressure 
      lowering effect of amlodipine vs diltiazem both on active maintenance treatment
      and after active treatment was interrupted for 2 days by placebo using a
      double-blind randomized design. After a single blind placebo run-in period,
      hypertensive patients were randomized to amlodipine 5 mg once daily or diltiazem 
      90 mg twice daily. After 4-6 weeks, doses were increased to 10 mg once daily or
      180 mg twice daily, if necessary for control of diastolic blood pressure. During 
      week 9 or 10 on active treatment blisterpacks contained 2 days of placebo.
      Twenty-four hour blood pressure monitoring was performed at the end of run-in
      period and during week 9 and 10 on active vs interrupted therapy. 3. Active
      therapy by amlodipine (n = 20) lowered day systolic blood pressure by 17 +/- 2
      mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 12 +/- 2 mmHg and did not change heart rate.
      In second day of interrupted therapy most of these responses were still present. 
      Diltiazem (n = 14) lowered day systolic blood pressure by 13 +/- 2 mmHg,
      diastolic blood pressure by 11 +/- 2 mmHg and heart rate by 10 +/- 2 beats min-1.
      Most of these responses had disappeared during the second day of interrupted
      therapy. 4. We conclude that amlodipine and diltiazem are fairly similar in
      lowering blood pressure from an efficacy point of view. However, during short
      periods of noncompliance blood pressure control will persist markedly better with
      the agent with a long vs the one with a short elimination half-life.

TI  - Prediction of patient responses to antihypertensive drugs using genetic
      polymorphisms: investigation of renin-angiotensin system genes.
PG  - 259-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen
      (AGT) gene and the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-1
      converting enzyme (ACE) gene predict blood pressure response to different
      antihypertensive agents. DESIGN: Sixty-three patients with untreated essential
      hypertension were randomly assigned in a placebo-controlled crossover comparison 
      to atenolol 50 mg once daily, lisinopril 10 mg once daily and nifedipine SR 20 mg
      twice daily, and the effect on blood pressure was assessed by ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring (ABPM). In a further 44 patients, placebo-controlled ABPM
      data were available after treatment with a single agent (atenolol 50 mg once
      daily in 16 cases and lisinopril 10mg once daily in 28 cases). The change in
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure achieved by each agent was analysed for
      association with genotypes at the AGT and ACE gene loci. METHODS: Polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA from each individual was used
      to identify the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene. The M235T polymorphism of the
      AGT gene was detected by Tth111I digestion of PCR product. RESULTS: There was no 
      significant association between response to any drug and either the AGT M235T or 
      ACE I/D polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: The large variability between individuals in 
      the observed blood pressure response to these agents cannot be attributed to the 
      polymorphisms analysed at the ACE and AGT loci.

TI  - Twenty-four-hour antihypertensive efficacy of felodipine 10 mg extended-release: 
      the Italian inter-university study.
PG  - 255-61
AB  - We assessed the 24-h antihypertensive efficacy of an extended-release (ER) 10-mg 
      formulation of the dihydropyridine felodipine in mild-to-moderate essential
      hypertension [World Health Organization (WHO) stage I-II]. Thirty patients, 23
      men and 7 women, aged 37-70 years (mean 53 +/- 9 years) participated in a
      double-blind, randomized, cross-over study of felodipine 10 mg ER versus placebo.
      An ambulatory daytime diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 mm Hg at the end of a
      4-week run-in period was necessary to enter the 10-week treatment phase.
      Twenty-nine patients completed the treatment phase. Twenty-two underwent a 2-day 
      single-blind placebo follow-up to assess residual drug effects. All patients
      underwent ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) by Spacelabs 90207 recorders. Recorders
      were programmed to make automatic BP and heart rate (HR) measurements every 15
      min throughout the 24 h. Felodipine 10 mg ER significantly (p < 0.01) reduced
      ambulatory systolic BP (SBP) and DBP values throughout the 24-h, day (7 a.m. to
      11 p.m.) and night (11 p.m. to 7 a.m.) periods, but not influencing average
      ambulatory HR values. Trough-to-peak (T/P) ratios, calculated on the average
      ambulatory BP values measured in the 7-9 a.m. 2-h interval of the second day of
      ABPM (before the new drug administration: trough) and in the 10 a.m. to 12 noon
      2-h interval of the first day of ABPM (peak BP-lowering effect), were 0.71 and
      0.58 for SBP and DBP, respectively. Individual T/P calculations, after post hoc
      selection of nonresponders, gave superimposable results, the consistency of which
      was judged on mean, median, and confidence intervals (CI). However, the wide
      variability of the individual T/P ratios suggests that this method cannot be the 
      only means to evaluate the duration of action of an antihypertensive drug by
      ABPM. The long-acting BP-lowering drug effect was clearly shown by the ABPM
      performed in the follow-up when SBP and DBP average values of the 24-h, day, and 
      night periods were still reduced. Felodipine 10 mg ER effectively reduced BP in
      patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, showing prolonged duration of its
      antihypertensive action beyond the time of the next dose.

TI  - Gingival overgrowth in renal transplant patients administered cyclosporin A in
      mixture or in capsule form. A longitudinal study.
PG  - 71-6
AB  - Cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced gingival overgrowth was longitudinally studied in 45 
      adult renal transplant patients randomly assigned to be administered CsA orally
      in mixture or in capsule form. After 1 year of CsA therapy, 37% of the mixture
      and 43% of the capsule patients exhibited gingival overgrowth. In mixture
      patients gingival overgrowth was present, already after 1 month of CsA therapy
      and, after 12 months, mixture patients exhibited an increased number of sites
      with gingival overgrowth in the regions of the upper front and lower molars
      compared to capsule patients. In addition, the relative increase in gingival
      width of the interdental papillae of the maxillary central incisors and the
      mandibular first molars, measured buccolingually on stone casts, was also higher 
      in mixture patients than in capsule patients. In a stepwise multiple logistic
      regression analysis, the use of nifedipine and the total CsA dose administered
      during the first 6 posttransplant months were the predictors associated with
      gingival overgrowth. The study suggests that concomitant administration of
      nifedipine in renal transplant patients should be avoided and a change from the
      mixture form of CsA to the capsule form should be considered in order to minimize
      the development of CsA-induced gingival overgrowth.

TI  - ACE inhibitors in elderly patients with hypertension. Special considerations.
PG  - 29-37
AB  - Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have emerged as the class of
      antihypertensive and vasodilatatory agents of first choice in the treatment of
      elderly patients with hypertension. Normotensive patients with congestive heart
      failure, post-anterior myocardial infarction, or diabetes mellitus with evidence 
      of microangiopathy will also benefit from continuous ACE inhibition. The long
      term use of ACE inhibitors is associated with improved survival and reduced
      cardiovascular, cerebral and renal morbidity in these patients. In elderly
      atherosclerotic patients, these agents provide good control of systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure and peripheral resistance, with remarkable preservation 
      of vital organ perfusion and infrequent adverse effects. Used as monotherapy, the
      effectiveness of ACE inhibitors is limited. However, there are advantages for
      using them in combination with other drugs, notably thiazide diuretics, nitrates 
      and calcium antagonists. Renal function is thus preserved and left heart
      hypertrophy is prevented. There are no major differences between the various ACE 
      inhibitors, and the choice of drug is largely a matter of personal preference.

      on uteroplacental and fetal hemodynamics.
PG  - 177-84
AB  - This is a prospective randomised controlled study in 21 women admitted with
      preeclampsia in the third trimester. The mean arterial blood pressure decreased
      by 11.1 mmHg (95% confidence interval -14.9 to -7.3 mmHg) in the methyldopa
      group, and by 9.3 mmHG (95% confidence interval-14.4 to -4.2 mmHG) in the
      isradipine group. The maternal heart rate decreased by 6.9 beats per min (95%
      confidence interval -11.6 to -2.2 bpm) during methyldopa treatment, and by 2.5
      beats per min (95% confidence interval -9.2 to 4.3) during isradipine treatment. 
      Pulsatility index in maternal and fetal vessels was not affected by either of the
      two drugs. The birth weight and placental weight and neonatal outcome were
      similar and uneventful. The hypotensive effect was similar for methyldopa and
      isradipine. Except reduced maternal heart rate on methyldopa, fetal and
      uteroplacental hemodynamics were not altered during treatment of preeclampsia
      with methyldopa or isradipine.

TI  - Equivalent effects of nicardipine and captopril on urinary albumin excretion of
      type 2, non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects with mild to moderate
      hypertension.
PG  - 41-7
AB  - To test if calcium antagonists and converting enzyme inhibitors can act similarly
      on urinary albumin excretion of type 2, non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects
      with hypertension, a 24 week, double-blind, randomized, parallel multicentre
      study was performed in 111 such patients allocated to nicardipine 50 mg slow
      release form (n = 57) or to captopril 25 mg (n = 54) twice daily. The efficacy of
      both drugs was similar on urinary albumin excretion (Westlake test p = 0.19).
      However, blood pressure was lower on nicardipine than on captopril (p < 0.05),
      and the antialbuminuric effect of nicardipine was related to its hypotensive
      effect, while this was not the case for captopril. The two drugs were tolerated
      equally. Thus, nicardipine and captopril for 24 weeks can be equally effective on
      urinary albumin excretion of type 2, non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects with
      hypertension, but the mechanisms of their anti-albuminuric effects may be
      different.

PG  - 35-9
AB  - The combination of two antihypertensive drugs is recommended when mild to
      moderate hypertension is not controlled by sequential monotherapy. The aim of our
      study was to compare the efficacy and the safety of the combination enalapril 20 
      mg-hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg to that of enalapril 20 mg-nifedipine SL 20 mg x
      2. Two hundred and forty four hypertensive patients not controlled (DPB > 95
      mmHg) by a single dose of enalapril 20 mg/24 h, received for 4 weeks, one of
      these two combined therapies in a randomized double-blind trial. The efficacy was
      of same amplitude in the two groups (DBP: -10.8 mmHg
      enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide vs-10.3 mmHg enalapril-nifedipine). The side
      effects were less frequent in the enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide group (14 per
      cent vs 24 per cent, p = 0.04).

TI  - Cardiac function improvement 24 hours after isradipine SRO in patients with
      chronic stable angina: a double-blind randomized study.
PG  - 155-64
AB  - We recently showed that Isradipine, a calcium antagonist from the dihydropyridine
      group, reduces ischemia and improves ventricular function at rest and during
      exercise, 2 hours after a single oral dose, in patients with chronic stable
      angina. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of long acting slow
      release oral (SRO) Isradipine (5 mg) compared to a placebo in 30 coronary
      patients with stable chronic angina, randomized in a double blind-fashion. The
      following parameters were obtained at rest and during submaximal exercise: left
      and right ventricular (LV, RV) ejection fractions (EF; %) and peak filling rate
      (PFR; EDV/s), assessed by gated radionuclide angiography, clinical symptoms,
      electrocardiograms (ECG, ST segment depression; mm), systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure (SBP and DBP; mm Hg). Patients were then given two oral doses of either 
      Isradipine or placebo (one a day). The same parameters were reassessed, at rest
      and during n equivalent exercise, 48 hours later (24 hours after the last
      administration of the drug). The results after Isradipine (n = 14) showed, at
      rest, a significant increase in LVEF and Pfr (51 +/- 9 to 54 +/- 8 and 1.97 +/-
      0.44 to 2.36 +/- 0.71, respectively) and a decrease in DBP (93 +/- 11 to 87 +/-
      13); and during exercise, a significant increase in LVEF (51 +/- 11 tot 55 +/-
      13) and a decrease in ST segment depression (2.3 +/- 1.9 tot 1.9 +/- 1.6). No
      significant change was observed after placebo in the other 16 patients. We
      conclude that even 24 hours after an oral administration, Isradipine SRO
      maintains its beneficial effects both, at rest on LV systolic and diastolic
      function and pressure, and during exercise on ECG signs of ischemia with
      improvement in LV ejection fraction.

TI  - Comparison between a bid and a tid regimen: improved compliance with no improved 
      antihypertensive effect. The EOL Research Group.
PG  - 63-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare compliance with an antihypertensive treatment administered
      either twice daily or three times daily. The two formulations of the
      antihypertensive treatment used (nicardipine) "regular tablets" (t.d.) and "slow 
      release tablets" (b.d.) are bioequivalent at the daily dosage used in the study. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Open, controlled, parallel designed study with centralised,
      randomised allocation to the treatment groups: TID group: A nicardipine 20 mg
      tablet, three times daily for 3 months. BID group: A capsule of slow release (SR)
      nicardipine, 50 mg twice daily for 3 months. PATIENTS: 7274 hypertensive patients
      were investigated by 2.651 general practitioners. Compliance with the nicardipine
      was assessed by means of standardised interviews with the patients and by a
      questionnaire for the investigators. RESULTS: Compliance was slightly higher in
      the BID than in the TID group; 71.2% and 24.5% of patients in the first group
      declared their compliance was 100% and 80% compared to 82.3% and 15% in the
      second group. A statistically significant relationship was shown between
      compliance with nicardipine and the decrease in blood pressure after three months
      of therapy. However, no significant difference was noticed between the two groups
      of patients in the absolute decrease in blood pressure after the treatment
      period: 25.7/14.7 mm Hg in the TID group compared with 25.9/15.0 mm Hg in the BID
      group. CONCLUSIONS: A difference in compliance between the bioequivalent BID and 
      TID formulations of the same active agent was shown in hypertensive patients.
      However, the difference was not large enough to lead to a difference either in
      the number of controlled patients or in the decrease in blood pressure. Reducing 
      the number of daily doses does not automatically lead to greater efficacy of
      treatment.

TI  - Treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetic hypertensive patients with Ca2+
      channel blockers is associated with increased platelet sensitivity to insulin.
PG  - 1214-21
AB  - Insulin influences platelet function by reducing platelet responsiveness to
      vasoactive agonists. In hypertension these insulin-related inhibitory effects are
      blunted. The aim of this study was to determine whether platelet sensitivity to
      insulin is affected after 12 weeks of antihypertensive treatment with calcium
      channel blockers. Eleven patients with essential hypertension and
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes were treated with either isradipine or diltiazem. 
      Platelet free calcium concentration was measured spectrofluorometrically in
      nonstimulated and in angiotensin II (1 nmol/L)-stimulated platelets that had been
      pre-exposed to insulin (70 microU/mL). Platelets were studied before therapy and 
      after 12 weeks of treatment. Systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure
      decreased significantly during treatment. Both calcium channel blockers equally
      decreased fasting serum insulin levels (from 138 +/- 2.7 pmol/L before therapy to
      106 +/- 9.9 pmol/L after therapy). Results with both calcium channel antagonists 
      were similar and have been pooled. In the pretreatment phase, insulin
      pre-incubation had no effect on angiotensin II-stimulated intracellular free
      calcium and responses to angiotensin II were similar in the absence (265 +/- 10.5
      nmol/L) and presence of insulin (233 +/- 12.1 nmol/L). After treatment with
      calcium channel blockers, insulin significantly (P < .001) reduced angiotensin
      II-induced rise of intracellular free calcium from 214 +/- 7.7 nmol/L (absence of
      insulin) to 153 +/- 9.3 nmol/L (presence of insulin). Whether these effects are
      due specifically to calcium channel blockers or whether they are the result of
      lowering of blood pressure remains unclear. Serum insulin levels were positively 
      correlated with angiotensin II-stimulated increase in intracellular free calcium 
      in platelets pre-exposed to insulin, (r = 0.46; P < .05) suggesting that with
      increasing levels of insulin resistance, the inhibitory effects of insulin are
      reduced. This study shows that treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetic
      hypertensive patients with these calcium channel blockers reduces
      hyperinsulinemia and increases sensitivity of platelets to the inhibitory effect 
      of insulin on angiotensin II-stimulated calcium responses.

TI  - Antihypertensive effects of amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide in elderly
      patients with ambulatory hypertension.
PG  - 1154-9
AB  - Recent studies and authorities have advocated the use of low-dose thiazide
      diuretics as first-line treatment agents in elderly hypertensives. However, these
      recommendations were based solely on blood pressure (BP) measured in the clinic. 
      The objective of the present 32-week double-blind study was to compare the
      effects of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and amlodipine (AML) in elderly patients
      with confirmed ambulatory hypertension. After a 4-week placebo washout period, 42
      (25 men, 17 women) patients (mean age, 69 years) with clinic sitting diastolic BP
      of 95 to 114 mm Hg and daytime ambulatory diastolic BP of > or = 90 mm Hg were
      randomized double-blind to receive AML 5 to 10 mg (n = 21) or HCTZ 12.5 to 25 mg 
      (n = 21) once daily. After 8 weeks of monotherapy, patients in whom clinic
      diastolic BP remained > or = 90 mm Hg were given combination therapy with the
      other agent. Amlodipine monotherapy induced significant reductions in clinic,
      mean 24-h, daytime and sleep systolic/diastolic BPs whereas only clinic BP
      decreased significantly in patients treated with HCTZ monotherapy. Moreover,
      19/21 versus 8/21 patients on AML and HCTZ monotherapies achieved adequate BP
      control. At the end of the 32-week treatment period, combination therapy in the
      HCTZ group resulted in statistically significant reductions in clinic as well as 
      in 24-h, daytime and sleep ambulatory BPs that were similar to those observed in 
      the AML monotherapy group. In conclusion, the administration of AML monotherapy
      induced significant reductions in both clinic and ambulatory BPs in elderly
      patients whereas only clinic BP was significantly decreased by HCTZ monotherapy. 
      Moreover, the addition of AML to HCTZ in patients inadequately controlled by
      monotherapy has permitted statistically significant decrements in clinic as well 
      as in ambulatory BP. Consequently, the results of the present study suggest that 
      the use of HCTZ in doses of up to 25 mg daily is inadequate for ambulatory BP
      control in the elderly despite official recommendations.

PG  - 974-7
AB  - The lack of comparative studies of nifedipine and felodipine using 24-h blood
      pressure (BP) monitoring in the same patients led to the present study evaluating
      the antihypertensive efficacy and side effects of treatment with slow-release
      (SR) nifedipine (20 mg twice daily) and extended-release (ER) felodipine (10 mg
      once daily). In the double-blind study, subjects were randomly assigned to one of
      two treatment groups: 6 weeks of nifedipine SR (20 mg twice daily) followed by 6 
      weeks of felodipine (ER) (10 mg once daily with evening matched placebo), or vice
      versa. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring showed no significant

      differences in diastolic BP (DBP) throughout the 24 h, although the frequency of 
      DBP recordings > 90 mm Hg was greater during nifedipine (33.1%) than felodipine
      (27.75%) treatment. The most common side effects were flushing, palpitations,
      headaches, and ankle edema; there were no adverse effect on lipid profile or

TI  - [Increase of renal dopamine production induced by nifedipine in hypertensive
      patients. Double blind vs placebo study].
PG  - 535-40
AB  - Dopamine is synthetized and excreted by kidneys, this amine exerts its
      natriuretic and diuretic effects by inhibition of sodium reabsorption on kidney
      convoluted tubules. The objective of this study was to verify the changes of
      dopamine urinary excretion induced by nifedipine-LP treatment in hypertensive
      patients. Twenty four patients with essential hypertension (stages 1, 2) were
      included in this double-blind, placebo controlled study. Twelve patients received
      nifedipine (average daily dose, 21.5 mg/day) for 4 weeks, and 12 patients
      received placebo for the same time period. No significant changes were detected
      upon nifedipine treatment neither in plasma biochemical nor hematological
      parameters. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 
      significantly reduced from pretreatment values 168.0 +/- 8.7 mmHg and 102.0 +/-
      5.2 mmHg respectively, to end-treatment values 140.0 +/- 6.6 mmHg and 88.0 +/-
      5.6 mmHg (p < 0.05). Placebo treatment did not modify SBP and DBP. Urinary
      dopamine excretion increased by 53% from 679.5 +/- 80.1 micrograms/24 h prior to 
      treatment to 1040.0 +/- 110.1 micrograms/24 h after treatment (p < 0.009. 95%
      Confidence Interval of the Difference: -538.9 to -183.6). Urinary volume of
      nifedipine treated patients increased from 1613 +/- 85 mL/24 h to 1920 +/- 160
      mL/24 h post-treatment (p < 0.05). No significant changes were observed in
      urinary noradrenaline and adrenaline excretion in nifedipine or placebo treated
      patients. Analysis of fluorescent light excitation and emission spectra (200 nm
      to 800 nm) of dopamine extracted from patient's urine submitted to nifedipine
      treatment did not reveal any interference when compared to chemically pure
      dopamine. If is concluded that nifedipine treatment of hypertensive patients
      increases kidney dopamine production which in turn can exert a natriuretic and
      diuretic effect besides its well known vasodilator properties.

TI  - Nifedipine in migraine and tension headache: a randomised double blind crossover 
      study.
PG  - 770-2
AB  - Nifedipine was evaluated in the prophylaxis of 28 patients each of migraine and
      tension headache using a double blind cross over design with random allocation to
      drug or placebo group. The duration of the trial was 3 months with a 2 week
      run-in period and 2 week wash-oat period separating two treatment periods of 4
      weeks each. A satisfactory response was obtained in 71.4% of migraineurs (p <
      0.001) and 28.6% of patients with tension headache (p = N.S). Minor side effects 
      were observed in 5 patients. Nifedipine is a useful agent for the management of
      migraine as it reduces frequency and severity of pain but the drug cannot be
      recommended for tension headache.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure and left ventricular changes during antihypertensive
      treatment: perindopril versus isradipine.
PG  - 737-41
AB  - Using digitized M-mode echocardiograms and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP)
      monitoring, we compared the effects on left ventricle (LV) and BP of 6-month
      treatment with a calcium antagonist or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitor in 36 hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy (group 1, 18 subjects
      treated with sustained-release isradipine; group 2, 18 subjects treated with
      perindopril). At the basal evaluation, the two groups had comparable BP and LV
      parameters. After treatment, both groups showed a similar and significant
      reduction in 24-h, day- and night-systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP). The
      reduction in LV mass index was greater (p < 0.01) in group 2. In group 1,
      percentage of decrease of LV mass correlated significantly with percentage of
      decrease in 24-h and daytime BP; this was not true of group 2. Together with the 
      reduction in LV hypertrophy, there was a significant increase of peak lengthening
      rate of LV diameter that was greater (p < 0.01) in group 1. Both drugs can reduce
      LV hypertrophy and improve diastolic function. The reduction of hypertrophy
      induced by perindopril appears to be partly independent of BP decrease and
      therefore partly related to a direct action of perindopril on the myocardium.

TI  - Comparison of amlodipine and benazepril monotherapy to amlodipine plus benazepril
      in patients with systemic hypertension: a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. The Benazepril/Amlodipine Study Group.
PG  - 1060-6
AB  - A single-blind, run-in, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled comparison trial was conducted to assess the safety and
      efficacy of low-dose amlodipine 2.5 mg daily, low-dose benazepril 10 mg daily,
      and the combination of the two drugs at the same doses used once daily in
      patients (n = 401) with mild to moderate (stages I and II) systemic hypertension.
      Both monotherapy regimens were shown to significantly reduce both systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure compared with baseline placebo values, and the
      combination regimen was shown to be superior in lowering systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure when compared with either of the monotherapy regimens. The
      combination therapy also resulted in a greater percentage of patients having
      successful clinical response in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure. The
      amlodipine and benazepril regimen was also shown to be associated with a similar 
      incidence of adverse experiences as the active monotherapy or placebo regimens,
      although the group given combination therapy appeared to have a lower incidence
      of edema than the group given amlodipine alone. Low-dose amlodipine (2.5 mg) plus
      benazepril (10 mg) provides greater blood-pressure-lowering efficacy than either 
      monotherapy, and has an excellent safety profile.

TI  - Hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. A comparison between an
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium antagonist.
PG  - 203-8
AB  - The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme lisinopril were compared with
      those of the calcium antagonist nifedipine in 162 non-insulin-dependent diabetic 
      hypertensive patients for a 24-week period. In 83 and 79 patients, respectively, 
      lisinopril and slow-release nifedipine produced similar reductions in blood
      pressure (systolic/diastolic: -16/-13 mmHg supine and -14/-11 mmHg standing after
      lisinopril; -15/-12 mmHg supine and -14/-11 mmHg standing nifedipine). Fasting
      and post-prandial plasma glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin and plasma lipids
      appeared to be unaffected by either agent. Also, 28% of the patients on
      lisinopril and 30% of those on nifedipine presented microalbuminuria. Both drugs 
      induced a reduction in the albumin excretion rate (AER). The geometric mean
      x:tolerance factor of the reduction in AER among the 23 microalbuminuric patients
      on lisinopril (-10.0 x:1.3 micrograms/min) was greater, though not significantly 
      so, than that observed in the 26 on nifedipine (-0.9 x 1.2 micrograms/min).
      Moreover, lisinopril appeared to be better tolerated than nifedipine in our study
      population. Microalbuminuria is an important risk factor for cardiovascular
      mortality in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients as well as in the general
      population. To what extent a reduction in the AER could ameliorate diabetic
      patients is, at present, unknown. Finally, both lisinopril and nifedipine showed 
      a similar antihypertensive effect in these patients which was not associated with
      significant differences in plasma glucose, insulin or lipid concentrations. The
      clinical consequences of the insignificant differences in AER remain unclear.

TI  - Proarrhythmia with class III antiarrhythmic drugs: definition, electrophysiologic
      mechanisms, incidence, predisposing factors, and clinical implications.
PG  - 920-36
AB  - Antiarrhythmic drugs can and do induce unexpected and sometimes fatal reactions
      by either producing new symptomatic arrhythmias or by aggravating existing
      arrhythmias. The definition of proarrhythmia has changed since controlled
      clinical studies showed a dichotomy between arrhythmia suppression and mortality.
      The nature of proarrhythmic reactions is linked to the electrophysiologic effects
      of various antiarrhythmic drugs. Whereas Class I agents without accompanying
      effects on repolarization generally produce ventricular tachycardia (often
      incessant) or fibrillation, Class III agents typically produce torsades de
      pointes that may deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation. The precise mechanism
      of torsades de pointes is not fully elucidated, although early
      after-depolarization and increases in spatial or temporal dispersion of
      repolarization are likely possibilities. Proarrhythmic risk is lowest for
      amiodarone and is probably related to the drug's complex electrophysiologic
      profile. The incidence of torsades with sotalol increases with dose and the
      baseline values of the QT interval; the incidence with d-sotalol and other pure
      Class III agents remains unclear. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled
      studies to evaluate this are under way. The fact that d-sotalol increases
      mortality in postinfarction patients suggests that it may possibly be a common
      property of most, if not all, pure Class III compounds. The ongoing clinical
      trials with various Class III agents are likely to provide the critical
      information on this important therapeutic issue.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine on left ventricular mass in the Amlodipine Cardiovascular
      Community Trial.
PG  - 471-6
AB  - As part of the Amlodipine Cardiovascular Community Trial (ACCT), which was a
      large multicenter study designed to assess the effects of the calcium channel
      blocker amlodipine besylate (Norvasc) as monotherapy for treatment of mild to
      moderate hypertension, we sought to determine the effects of amlodipine on
      regression of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH). The study began with a
      2-week placebo run-in period (baseline), before which antihypertensive drugs had 
      been discontinued. Amlodipine was then administered at 5-10 mg/day during a
      4-week titration/efficacy period. Patients achieving a goal diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP) of < or = 90 mm Hg or a decrease in DBP of > or = 10 mm Hg entered
      a 12-week maintenance phase and had the option to continue long-term therapy
      thereafter. Echocardiograms were obtained in a subset of patients at the end of
      the baseline period. In patients with LVH at baseline, echocardiograms were
      repeated at the end of 16 weeks of therapy (week 18), and at 42 weeks in patients
      continuing long-term therapy. Thirty-seven percent of 124 hypertensive patients
      screened for LVH at baseline had LVH detected on echocardiograms. Blacks had a
      higher incidence of LVH (64%) as compared with whites (34%, p < 0.05). Patients
      with LVH were more likely to have a higher baseline systolic BP (SBP) and DBP.
      Their sitting SBP and DBP decreased significantly from a mean of 163/102 mm Hg at
      baseline to 139/86 mm Hg with amlodipine therapy at week 18 (p <
      0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Antihypertensive treatment with verapamil and amlodipine. Their effect on the
      functional autonomic and cardiovascular stress responses.
PG  - 1277-84
AB  - Many biological and psychological factors induce haemodynamic and
      extra-cardiovascular functional changes mediated by the autonomic nervous system.
      Pharmacological blood pressure reduction, as a neurovegetative stimulus, can
      change the arousal of the sympathetic nervous system. We evaluated the effects of
      two calcium channel blockers, verapamil and amlodipine, both administered as
      monotherapies, upon the sympathetic stress response in 23 randomized
      mild-to-moderate essential hypertensives (161 +/- 2/98 +/- 1 mmHg). Patients
      performed four stress tests (mental arithmetic, colour word Stroop, cold pressor 
      and handgrip) while extracardiovascular and haemodynamic functions were assessed 
      non-invasively at every heart beat, during baseline, stress and recovery phases. 
      The sympathetic response was evaluated by computing the 'area-under-the-curve'
      (value x time) measured during the psychophysiological session. The session was
      repeated at run-in, after placebo and during treatment. After one month's
      treatment, baseline blood pressure was significantly reduced in patients treated 
      with amlodipine (139 +/- 1/84 +/- 1 mmHg; P < 0.001) and verapamil (140 +/- 2/85 
      +/- 1 mmHg; P < 0.001). The emotional arousal (frontalis muscular contraction,
      skin conductance) was unchanged, but the cutaneous vascular response was reduced 
      (P < 0.05) in patients treated with verapamil. No changes in systolic or
      diastolic blood pressure were detectable, but amlodipine increased the heart rate
      response (P < 0.05). In contrast, verapamil reduced the heart rate (P < 0.05)
      without depressing the cardiac output response, which was increased with
      amlodipine (P < 0.05). Total vascular resistance was significantly (P < 0.001)
      reduced with both the treatments. Consequently, functional cardiac load,
      expressed by pressure-rate product and cardiac power, was significantly enhanced 
      with amlodipine and reduced with verapamil. In conclusion, the abnormal
      sympathetic stress response, which characterizes the hypertensive patient, might 
      be affected by the choice of medication. Verapamil in particular, moderated
      emotional arousal, the vasoconstrictive response and reduced cardiac load without
      lowering cardiac output demands. In contrast, in patients treated with
      amlodipine, in whom the cardiac output response was increased, the pattern was
      reversed and the functional cardiac load was also increased.

TI  - Randomised, double-blind, parallel study of the anti-hypertensive efficacy and
      safety of losartan potassium compared with felodipine ER in elderly patients with
      mild to moderate hypertension.
PG  - 765-71
AB  - This study investigated the anti-hypertensive efficacy and tolerability of
      once-daily losartan potassium (50 mg titrated to 100 mg), an angiotensin II
      receptor antagonist, compared with once daily felodipine extended release (ER) (5
      mg titrated to 10 mg), a calcium channel blocker, after 12 weeks of therapy in
      elderly hypertensive patients. Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo baseline
      period, qualifying patients were randomly allocated to 12 weeks of double-blind
      treatment with losartan potassium or felodipine ER. After 6 weeks, patients with 
      a 24 h post-dose sitting diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mm Hg had their dose 
      doubled for the remaining 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, there was a greater BP response
      for felodipine ER than losartan potassium in elderly patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension. However, after 12 weeks of therapy, losartan potassium
      reduced BP as effectively as felodipine ER with no differences in mean BP
      reduction or anti-hypertensive response category between treatment groups. In
      this study, both treatments were well tolerated; felodipine ER was associated
      with a numerically higher incidence of headache and oedema while the incidence of
      asthenia was numerically higher in losartan-treated patients.

TI  - Hypertension in the elderly: 24 h ambulatory blood pressure results from a
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 723-7
AB  - Calcium channel blockers are increasingly used to treat hypertension in elderly
      patients. To assess the effects of low-dose, long-acting verapamil on blood
      pressure (BP) and quality of life (QOL) in elderly patients, verapamil 120-240 mg
      of placebo was given once daily for 8 weeks to 76 patients aged > or = 60 years. 
      After a 4-week placebo wash-out period, patients with a sitting DBP of 95-110 mm 
      Hg and a mean daytime (6 am to 6 pm) ambulatory DBP > or = 90 mm Hg were entered 
      into the study. Twenty four-hour BP monitoring as well as QOL self-assessment and
      digit span testing of cognitive function were performed at the end of the placebo
      wash-out and double-blind treatment periods. Patients treated with verapamil
      showed a significant decrease in mean whole-day BP, while those treated with
      placebo showed a small increase in BP. Treatment differences between the two
      groups in SBP and DBP were each statistically significant (P < 0.01). Significant
      differences were also seen when the 24 h period was divided into daytime and
      night-time readings. Both QOL and digit span testing scores were unchanged from
      baseline for verapamil-treated patients and were not different from the
      placebo-treated group. The results of this study demonstrate consistent and
      significant decreases in BP throughout the 24 h period with no adverse effects on
      QOL or cognitive function this this formulation of verapamil in elderly
      hypertensive patients.

TI  - Effects of felodipine, metoprolol and their combination on blood pressure at rest
      and during exercise and on volume regulatory hormones in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 300-6
AB  - The effects on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), at rest and during
      bicycle exercise, of the vascular selective calcium antagonist felodipine, the
      cardio-selective beta-blocker metoprolol, and of the two drugs in combination,
      were assessed in a double-blind, three-way cross-over study comprising 23
      patients with essential, mild to moderate hypertension. All three treatment
      regimens were given to each patient in randomised order for 4 weeks after a 4
      week placebo run-in period. Felodipine 10-20 mg daily, metoprolol 100-200 mg
      daily and the combination of felodipine 10-20 mg plus metoprolol 100 mg daily
      were all effective antihypertensive treatments both at rest and during exercise. 
      The two drugs seemed to have additive effects and the effect on BP of the
      combination was greater than that of either drug given as monotherapy. The mean
      sitting BP was 148/103 mmHg at randomisation, after 4 weeks of placebo treatment,
      and 134/88, 134/94 and 121/84 mmHg, respectively, after 4 weeks' treatment with
      felodipine, metoprolol and the combination. Maximal exercise capacity was similar
      irrespective of treatment regimen, and the normal response to exercise BP and HR 
      was maintained during all active treatments. Changes observed in volume
      regulatory hormones (PRA, aldosterone and ANP) were consistent with a direct
      tubular natriuretic-diuretic effect of felodipine and of beta-blocker attenuated 
      release of renin. All treatment regimens were well tolerated and adverse events
      reported were usually mild and transient.

TI  - Contemporary management of atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1135-52
AB  - The incidence of atrial fibrillation approximately doubled for every 10-year
      increment in age in the Framingham Heart Study cohort; thus physicians will be
      faced with an increasing patient population with atrial fibrillation.
      Hypertension is observed to be the most common associated risk factor in both
      sexes. The management of patients with atrial fibrillation is evolving as a
      result of a number of published studies. Calcium channel blockers and
      beta-blockers are emerging as the preferred choices for rate control rather than 
      digoxin. Low-dose anticoagulation therapy has shown beneficial effects not only
      in primary prevention, but also for secondary prevention of thromboembolism.
      Thus, patients who cannot be successfully cardioverted should be anticoagulated
      if there are no contraindications (Table 3) and if they do not fall into the
      low-risk group--defined as patients under the age of 65 without risk factors
      (hypertension, diabetes, previous stroke). Patients not eligible for
      anticoagulation should be on aspirin therapy. Patients with lone atrial
      fibrillation are not at higher risk for thromboembolism than the general
      population; therefore, they can be managed without anticoagulation or
      antiplatelet therapy. Antiarrhythmic treatment should be approached cautiously;
      amiodarone in low doses is the most effective and safe treatment, but this
      remains controversial.

AB  - To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel delivery system of physiologic
      pattern release (PPR)-verapamil administered nocturnally to patients with stages 
      I and II hypertension using ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, we
      performed a multicenter (17 centers), double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial with placebo and 120, 180, 360, and 540 
      mg of verapamil in 287 randomized patients. The delivery system has a delay in
      the release of verapamil for 4 to 6 hours, and then delivers the drug from an
      osmotic pumping system for approximately 12 hours. Patients were dosed at 10 P.M.
      The primary end point was change from baseline in trough diastolic BP assessed by
      ambulatory BP monitoring from 6 to 10 P.M. after 8 weeks of therapy, whereas
      secondary measures included changes from baseline in peak, early morning (6 to 10
      A.M.) systolic and diastolic BP, trough clinic BP, and 24-hour average daytime (8
      A.M. to 8 P.M.) and nighttime (8 P.M. to 8 A.M.) BP. The 180, 360, and 540 mg
      verapamil doses achieved statistically significant reductions in trough (6 to 10 
      P.M.) diastolic BP (-3.9 +/- 1.0, -7.8 +/- 1.2, and -10.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg,
      respectively). Reductions in peak early morning (6 to 10 A.M.) diastolic BP were 
      greater (-4.6 +/- 0.9, -13.3 +/- 1.2, and -19.0 +/- 1.2, for 180, 360, and 540
      mg, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Quality of blood pressure control in general practice and in the HOT study.
      French Research Group HOT (Hypertension Optimal Treatment)].
PG  - 1179-81
AB  - A previous investigation of the French League against Hypertension has shown that
      only 27% of the hypertensives aged below 64 years and 19% of those aged above 64 
      years have their BP controlled under treatment (BP < 140/90 mmHg). The
      international, prospective, randomised HOT study aims at assessing the optimal
      diastolic BP (DBP) level during active antihypertensive treatment to reduce at
      the best the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The study is on-going, with 
      a completion of inclusions. The BP measurements are performed by oscillometric
      method with the D2 international BP device, HESTIA. At enrollment, only 52% of
      the hypertensives were treated, their mean BP level being 161/99 mmHg +/- 18/9
      mmHg (n = 10,005). On randomisation, two weeks after the treatment withdrawal, BP
      was 170/106 +/- 15/4 mmHg. Six months later, under treatment, BP was 150/84 +/-
      10/7 mmHg with a mean decrease of 11/15 mmHg compared to values under previous
      treatment. Depending on the randomisation groups which are defined by different
      DBP objectives, 87.5 to 92.2% of the patients have a BP normalisation (DBP < or =
      90 mmHg) after one year of treatment. Five explanations may be proposed for the
      better BP control observed in the study compared to the results at inclusion,
      reflecting the general practice: (1) the fact that the patient is free to
      participate and has been informed may have improved the compliance, (2) the
      patient's follow-up was reinforced during the first weeks, (3) the protocol is
      based on the treatment initiation by a dihydropyridine with a long duration of
      action: felodipine, (4) the BP objectives are rigorously defined by a DBP between
      80 and 90 mmHg depending on the randomisation group whereas in general practice, 
      the physician may have a smoother objective mainly aiming at improving
      tolerability, (5) the larger use of a bi-therapy. CONCLUSION. The more ambitious 
      aims of BP control (DBP < or = 90, 85, 80 mmHg) in this study have induced a
      treatment intensification with a better BP control.

TI  - Comparison of amlodipine and quinapril on ambulatory blood pressure and platelet 
      function in hypertension.
PG  - 637-41
AB  - The effect of calcium channel blocker (CCB), amlodipine (5-10 mg/day) and
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril (10-40 mg/day) on
      ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), rheological and platelet function in
      hypertension were compared in this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled
      cross-over study. This study was preceded by 4 weeks placebo run-in period and
      the total duration of the study was 28 weeks. Casual and 24 h ABP, plasma renin
      activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (PA) concentration as well as metabolic and
      platelet function were determined before and at the end of each drug therapy. A
      total of 27 patients completed this study. Casual BP was significantly reduced
      after amlodipine or quinapril treatment, but there was no change in heart rate.
      Regarding the 24 h ABP, amlodipine produced a fall from 145 +/- 8/94 +/- 7 to 130
      +/- 13/85 +/- 10 mm Hg (P < 0.001 for both SBP and DBP). Quinapril also caused a 
      reduction from 144 +/- 10/94 +/- 7 to 134 +/- 12/88 +/- 8 mm Hg (P < 0.001 for
      both SBP and DBP). Neither amlodipine nor quinapril produce any significant
      change in heart rate. The level of 6-keto-prostaglandin Fl alpha (6-Keto-PGFl
      alpha) was increased from 36.8 +/- 4.4 to 45.1 +/- 2.5 pg/ml (P < 0.05) and no
      significant change of thromboxane B2(TXB2) was noted after amlodipine treatment. 
      PRA was increased from 1.24 +/- 0.31 to 1.62 +/- 0.41 ng/ml/h (P < 0.05) after
      quinapril treatment. Other biochemical parameters were unchanged.(ABSTRACT

PG  - 611-6
AB  - The anti-hypertensive efficacy and safety of extended-release (ER) felodipine (5,
      10 or 20 mg) and amlodipine (5 or 10 mg) once daily were compared in patients
      with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension in a double-blind, double-dummy,
      randomised, comparative study. A total of 118 patients were allocated to a
      12-week, double-blind treatment with either felodipine ER (n = 57) or amlodipine 
      (n = 61). The anti-hypertensive effect was evaluated by measuring office blood
      pressure (BP) at baseline and after 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks, together with 24 h
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) at baseline, on day 1 of treatment
      and at the end of the study. The mean office BP changes from baseline to week 12 
      were -13.4 (+/- 15.7)/-11.8 (+/- 6.9) mmHg for felodipine ER (mean daily dose
      11.2 mg) and -15.3 (+/- 17.0)/-12.9 (+/- 7.3) mm Hg for amlodipine (mean daily
      dose 7.4 mg). All BP reductions were significant (P < 0.01) with respect to time,
      but differences between treatment groups were not significant. The mean
      ambulatory BP changes from baseline to end of the study were -11.6 (+/-
      5.2)/-10.0 (+/- 2.0) mmHg for felodipine ER and -16.3 (+/- 4.4)/-9.6 (+/- 3.0) mm
      Hg for amlodipine, both significant (P < 0.01). The fall in ambulatory SBP was
      significantly greater (P < 0.001) in the patients treated with amlodipine
      compared with felodipine ER whereas there was no difference between the groups
      with respect to ambulatory DBP. Both drgs were well tolerated with a withdrawl
      rate of 12% equally distributed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 794-9
AB  - To compare and contrast the antihypertensive efficacy of an
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to a calcium antagonist, 88 and 90 
      patients with essential hypertension were randomly assigned to receive moexipril 
      and verapamil, respectively. At the end of the first 6 weeks of active therapy,
      sitting diastolic blood pressure decreased by 11 mmHg in patients receiving
      moexipril and by 9 mmHg in patients receiving verapamil. The 24-week treatment
      period was completed by 72 patients who received moexipril and 71 patients who
      received verapamil. Mean decreases in sitting diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg
      and 11 mmHg were observed in the respective intent-to-treat moexipril and
      verapamil groups. At doses of 7.5 mg and 15 mg once daily, moexipril had an
      antihypertensive effect comparable to that of sustained-release verapamil at
      doses of 180 mg and 240 mg once daily.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy and safety of nifedipine coat-core versus amlodipine
      in the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.
      Hypertension Study Group.
PG  - 686-700
AB  - The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of once-daily nifedipine coat-core was
      compared with that of once-daily amlodipine in a multicenter, prospective,
      double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study in which titration was based on
      response. The study consisted of a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period
      followed by an 8-week double-blind treatment period. Double-blind treatment began
      with nifedipine coat-core 30 mg or amlodipine 5 mg. After 4 weeks of double-blind
      therapy, patients with a trough seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 90
      mm Hg received an increased dose of nifedipine coat-core (60 mg) or amlodipine
      (10 mg). A total of 207 patients received the study medication at 12
      private-practice medical centers. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was
      performed at six medical centers with 38 nifedipine coat-core and 37 amlodipine
      patients. Data from 176 patients were valid for the primary efficacy analysis.
      Treatment groups were well matched with respect to baseline demographic and
      disease characteristics. During the study period, 59 (65.6%) nifedipine coat-core
      patients remained on their original 30-mg dose of study medication compared with 
      52 (60.5%) amlodipine patients who remained on the 5-mg starting dose. Mean
      trough blood pressure at baseline was 160.9/101.9 mm Hg in the nifedipine
      coat-core patients compared with 160.5/101.8 mm Hg in the amlodipine patients.
      Mean trough blood pressures at end point were 141.3/85.5 mm Hg and 140.7/85.9 mm 
      Hg in the nifedipine coat-core and amlodipine groups, respectively. Equivalence
      between the two treatment groups was demonstrated based on the difference between
      amlodipine and nifedipine coat-core in the change from baseline in trough seated 
      DBP (90% confidence interval, -0.50 to 2.59). Systolic blood pressure and 24-hour
      ABPM data supported the equivalent antihypertensive efficacy of the two
      treatments. Both drugs were well tolerated and had similar safety profiles.
      Nineteen patients in the amlodipine group experienced at least one adverse event 
      compared with 12 in the nifedipine coat-core group. The amlodipine patients
      tended toward a later occurrence of adverse events plus a greater number of
      events, particularly edema and gastrointestinal symptoms. More patients in the
      nifedipine coat-core group (n = 3) than in the amlodipine group (n = 1)
      discontinued treatment because of adverse events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

TI  - The efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide in Nigerians 
      with essential hypertension.
PG  - 485-8
AB  - The efficacy and safety of the novel calcium antagonist Amlodipine (Pfizer
      Laboratories, New York, New York) and hydrochlorothiazide were evaluated and
      compared in a randomized, single-blind, parallel group study in black Africans
      with essential hypertension. Twenty Nigerians with newly diagnosed mild to
      moderate essential hypertension were randomized to receive ascending doses of
      Amlodipine (5 mg and 10 mg) or hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg or 50 mg), and blood
      pressure and heart rate were measured at baseline and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks of
      therapy. Both Amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide significantly reduced supine and
      erect blood pressure. Supine blood pressure on Amlodipine fell from a mean of
      190/104 mm Hg to 150/79 mm Hg, and on thiazide from 180/103 mm Hg to 141/84 mm
      Hg. There was, however, no significant difference between both drugs in
      antihypertensive efficacy. Neither drug induced a reflex increase in heart rate. 
      The fall in blood pressure on both agents was associated with an increase in
      plasma urea. Amlodipine induced no change in plasma potassium, but
      hydrochlorothiazide caused hypokalemia. Both agents were well tolerated, and
      Amlodipine should undergo further study in the treatment of hypertension in
      blacks.

TI  - New occupational risk factors for chronic renal failure.
PG  - 7-11
AB  - Occupational pollutants may have a role in development of chronic renal failure
      (CRF). Most epidemiological studies have been cross-sectional, limited to certain
      renal diagnoses, or concentrated on early transient renal effects. In a
      case-control study, we examined the association between CRF and occupational
      exposure. Occupational histories of 272 men and women with CRF (of all types)
      were compared with those of 272 controls matched for age, sex, and region of
      residence. Exposures were assessed and degree and frequency were scored
      independently by three industrial hygienists unaware of case/control status.
      Significantly increased risks of CRF were found for exposure to lead (odds ratio 
      2.11 [95% CI 1.23-4.36]), copper (2.54 [1.16-5.53]), chromium (2.77 [1.21-6.33]),
      tin (3.72 [1.22-11.3]), mercury (5.13 [1.02-25.7]), welding fumes (2.06
      [1.05-4.04]), silicon-containing compounds (2.51 [1.37-4.60]), grain dust (2.96
      [1.24-7.04]), and oxygenated hydrocarbons (5.45 [1.84-16.2]). The frequencies of 
      various occupational exposures were high among patients with diabetic
      nephropathy. This epidemiological study confirms previously identified risk
      factors and suggests that additional occupational exposures, for which there is
      some other experimental evidence, may be important in the development of CRF. The
      role of grain dust and the association between occupational exposure and diabetic
      nephropathy merit further investigation.

TI  - Streptokinase-induced transient aggravation of myocardial injury.
PG  - 107-16
AB  - We examined the relationship between streptokinase infusion, intensity of
      myocardial injury and systemic hypotension in patients receiving streptokinase
      for treatment of evolving acute myocardial infarction. Twenty consecutive
      patients treated with streptokinase for evolving acute myocardial infarction
      received continuous blood pressure and S-T segment monitoring of the 12 lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG) for at least 5 h, commencing prior to commencement of the
      streptokinase infusion. Aggravation of injury, manifested both by episodic
      increases in S-T segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) (P < 0.001),
      and in mean S-T segment elevation (P < 0.05) occurred within the first 20 min
      after initiation of streptokinase infusion. Hypotension also occurred transiently
      in most patients, with a mean minimum systolic blood pressure of 92 +/- 22 (S.D.)
      mmHg occurring 16 +/- 5 min after commencement of streptokinase. There was no
      correlation between the extent of aggravation of injury and that of hypotension. 
      All patients showed ECG evidence of reperfusion, with a reduction of S-T
      elevation in the reference lead to 50% of maximal value, after a median of 62 min
      (range 9-174 min). It is concluded that streptokinase aggravates injury prior to 
      reperfusion, although probably not via the induction of hypotension: It is
      possible that this effect contributes to the 'early hazard' of thrombolytic
      therapy.

TI  - Amlodipine induces a flow and pressure-independent vasoactive effect on the
      brachial artery in hypertension.
PG  - 641-9
AB  - 1. The objectives of this study were to study the flow-dependent arterial
      reactivity and pressure-independent arterial compliance of the calcium antagonist
      amlodipine in hypertensive men. 2. Twenty-one hypertensive patients were
      randomized to receive 2 months treatment with placebo (n = 10) or 5-10 mg
      amlodipine (n = 11) once a day. Non-invasive measurement of brachial artery mean 
      blood pressure, diameter and flow (pulsed Doppler) and compliance (arterial
      mechanography and logarithmic elastic model) were obtained before and after drug 
      administration. Vasoreactivity was studied by means of response of the brachial
      artery during exclusion of the hand and hyperaemia post-ischaemia. 3. Compared
      with placebo, amlodipine reduced mean blood pressure (% change +/- s.e. mean 11
      +/- 1% vs 4 +/- 3%, P < 0.05), and increased arterial compliance at prevailing
      pressure (44 +/- 13%, vs 1 +/- 8%, P < 0.05) and at isobaric pressure (26 +/- 10%
      vs -3 +/- 6%, P < 0.05). A significant % change increase from baseline in
      brachial artery diameter between placebo and amlodipine was observed at rest (-2 
      +/- 3 vs 8 +/- 3%; P < 0.05), after wrist occlusion (-3 +/- 3 vs 6 +/- 2%; P <
      0.05) and during reactive hyperaemia (-5 +/- 3 vs 18 +/- 5%; P < 0.05). No
      significant differences between amlodipine and placebo groups were observed in
      blood velocity after forearm manoeuvres before and after treatment. 4. No
      differences were observed between groups in brachial flow-dependent
      vasodilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Emergent management of the patient in preterm labor.
PG  - 197-214
AB  - Clinicians who treat PTL should realize that side effects rarely occur when
      tocolytic medications are properly used. The beneficial effects of tocolytic
      therapy vastly outweigh the risks associated with their use for the prolongation 
      of gestation. Even a short extension of in utero life for a few days or weeks can
      significantly and positively affect neonatal survival and long-term outcome.
      Although the opponents of tocolytic therapy argue that no reduction in the PTB
      rate has occurred since their introduction, this argument does not consider that 
      the large majority of PTBs are not eligible for tocolytic intervention. If
      patients with clear indications for tocolysis could be compared with those that
      were not treated (which most studies have not done), a substantial beneficial
      effect of tocolytic administration probably would be demonstrated. Based on
      available data, we consider MgSO4 and terbutaline to be first-line tocolytics.
      Magnesium is used more often because of its lower side-effect profile.
      Indomethacin and nifedipine should be reserved for difficult or refractory
      preterm labor, and should only be used for intervals of < or = 48 hours. We have 
      attempted to present a method of decision analysis which should be followed for
      every patient who is admitted to the obstetric care unit for a presumptive
      diagnosis of premature labor. We realize that many of the issues included here
      are controversial, however, we hope that by developing a decision tree (see Fig. 
      1), a more complete management scheme will be created and lead to improved care
      of the patient undergoing premature labor.

TI  - The effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on blood pressures of
      patients with hypertension controlled by verapamil.
PG  - 1049-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may attenuate the
      antihypertensive effects of diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibitors, central alpha-agonists, and other vasodilators. Their effects 
      on the antihypertensive efficacy of calcium channel blockers are inadequately
      studied in small numbers of patients but appear to be minimal. METHODS: A
      three-phase, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study
      included 162 patients aged 18 to 75 years with essential hypertension. After
      diastolic blood pressure was controlled to 90 mm Hg or less with once-daily
      verapamil hydrochloride, patients received ibuprofen, naproxen, or placebo
      matching capsules for 3 weeks, and blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and
      adverse effects were evaluated. A general linear model with 95% confidence
      intervals was used to compare each nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment 
      group with the placebo group. RESULTS: No significant differences in sitting,
      standing, or supine blood pressure were noted with naproxen or ibuprofen compared
      with placebo. The percentages of patients in each treatment group with increases 
      of 10 mm Hg or more in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure were similar. 
      Statistically significant increases in weight were seen with both nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug therapies. Changes in pulse rate were not significant. The
      incidence of adverse effects was similar across all three treatment groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: The addition of naproxen or ibuprofen to the treatment of
      hypertensive patients in whom blood pressure is controlled by once-daily
      verapamil does not cause an increase in blood pressure. Verapamil may therefore
      offer considerable advantages in maintaining control of blood pressure in
      patients who regularly receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy.

TI  - Invasive hemodynamic evaluation of sublingual captopril and nifedipine in
      patients with arterial hypertension after abdominal aortic surgery.
PG  - 843-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the central hemodynamic and blood gas responses to
      sublingual captopril and nifedipine administration in patients with arterial
      hypertension after abdominal aortic surgery. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized,
      parallel-group clinical study. SETTING: Twenty-nine-bed medical-surgical
      intensive care unit in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty patients with
      arterial hypertension (mean arterial pressure of > or = 115 mm Hg) the day after 
      abdominal aortic surgery. Patients with bilateral renal artery stenoses,
      identified with the preoperative angiogram, were excluded. INTERVENTIONS:
      Pressures were measured using intravascular catheters and cardiac output was
      determined by thermodilution for 2 hrs after captopril 25 mg (n = 10) or
      nifedipine 10 mg (n = 10) was administered by the sublingual route. MEASUREMENTS 
      AND MAIN RESULTS: Captopril administration and nifedipine administration
      decreased mean arterial pressure (from 121 +/- 1 to 94 +/- 4 mm Hg and from 121
      +/- 2 to 94 +/- 2 [sem] mm Hg, respectively), pulmonary arterial pressure,
      pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, and right atrial pressure (p < .001 for all 
      variables). Changes in heart rate and in cardiac output were not significant.
      PaO2 decreased after nifedipine, from 101 +/- 8 to 81 +/- 3 torr [13.5 +/- 1.1 to
      10.8 +/- 0.4 kPa] (p < .01), but not after captopril (104 +/- 9 to 100 +/- 7 torr
      [13.9 +/- 1.2 to 13.3 +/- 0.9 kPa]). Excessive or symptomatic decreases in blood 
      pressure were not observed, nor was deterioration in renal function observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Sublingual captopril and nifedipine were equally effective for the
      treatment of arterial hypertension after abdominal aortic surgery. Nifedipine,
      but not captopril, caused a deterioration in pulmonary gas exchange.

TI  - Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of oral nicardipine in treatment of urgent 
      hypertension: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 917-23
AB  - This study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral nicardipine
      for the treatment of urgent hypertension in the emergency department. Of 57
      patients with urgent hypertension 53 patients were enrolled: 36 men and 17 women,
      43 black and 10 white, age range 48 +/- 11 years, and diastolic blood pressure
      128 +/- 7 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg nicardipine or 
      placebo in blind fashion followed by 30 mg open-label nicardipine in
      nonresponders. Responders to one or two doses of nicardipine received 30 or 40 mg
      nicardipine three times a day for 1 week after discharge from the emergency
      department. Adequate blood pressure reduction, defined as a reduction of
      diastolic blood pressure to less than 100 mm Hg or by at least 20 mm Hg, was
      achieved in 65% and 22% of patients who received 30 mg nicardipine or placebo (p 
      = 0.002). Adequate blood pressure reduction after administration of open-label
      nicardipine occurred in 76% of the nonresponders to placebo. Blood pressure
      reductions were maintained at 1 week after discharge. The drug was well
      tolerated, and no significant adverse events occurred. We conclude that oral
      nicardipine is a safe and effective drug for the initial treatment of urgent
      hypertension.

TI  - Effects of different antihypertensive drugs on plasma fibrinogen in hypertensive 
      patients.
PG  - 471-6
AB  - 1. In order to evaluate whether treatment with different antihypertensive drugs
      would affect plasma fibrinogen levels, 118 mild to moderate essential
      hypertensive subjects, all males, aged 18 to 65 years, were randomly treated with
      amlodipine 10 mg, atenolol 100 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg or lisinopril 20 mg,
      all given once daily for 8 weeks. 2. Before and after 8 weeks' treatment, blood
      pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), fibrinogen, total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C,
      triglycerides (TG), plasma glucose, plasma uric acid, serum creatinine and serum 
      potassium were evaluated. 3. All four medications significantly reduced BP
      values, although the BP lowering effect of lisinopril, amlodipine and atenolol
      was significantly greater compared with that of hydrochlorothiazide. 4. Plasma
      fibrinogen levels were unaffected by atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide and
      amlodipine, whereas they were significantly decreased by lisinopril (-11.2%, P = 
      0.002). This fibrinogen lowering effect was more evident in smokers (-17.7%) than
      in non smokers (-7.4%). 5. Atenolol and amlodipine did not significantly affect
      plasma lipids, hydrochlorothiazide increased TC, LDL-C and TG and reduced HDL-C; 
      lisinopril increased HDL-C and decreased TC and LDL-C. 6. Hydrochlorothiazide
      increased plasma glucose and uric acid concentrations, which were unaffected by
      the other drugs. The diuretic also reduced serum potassium. 7. The results of
      this study indicate that lisinopril reduces levels of plasma fibrinogen and
      confirm that different antihypertensive drugs may elicit different metabolic
      effects, which may variously influence the overall risk profile of the
      hypertensive patients.

TI  - A multicenter comparison of adverse reaction profiles of isradipine and enalapril
      at equipotent doses in patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 484-92
AB  - A multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial compared the safety and efficacy of
      the dihydropyridine isradipine with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitor enalapril given twice daily for mild hypertension. 160 patients
      received either isradipine (starting at 1.25 mg twice daily) or enalapril
      (starting at 2.5 mg twice daily) for 10 weeks. The dosage was increased if the
      average sitting diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mm Hg. Significantly greater
      mean reductions in systolic blood pressure were seen after 2, 6, and 8 weeks of
      isradipine. However, by the end of the trial, 83% of patients receiving
      isradipine and 78% receiving enalapril showed a decrease of at least 5 mm Hg in
      sitting diastolic blood pressure to a level below 96 mm Hg. Possible or probable 
      drug-related adverse effects were reported in 36% of patients showing a good
      antihypertensive response to isradipine, and in 30% of those who responded to
      enalapril. There was a trend for a lower frequency of adverse effects in
      isradipine non-responders (25%) and a higher frequency in enalapril
      non-responders (43%). Pruritus, dizziness, edema, and fatigue were reported more 
      often with isradipine, and cough and changed bowel habits were more common with
      enalapril. The relationship between the pattern of adverse effects and the extent
      of blood pressure reduction may be dependent on the mechanism of action of a
      drug. In responders, isradipine and enalapril showed differing patterns, but a
      similar overall incidence of adverse effects.

TI  - Changes in extracellular matrix macromolecules in human gingiva after treatment
      with drugs inducing gingival overgrowth.
PG  - 393-400
AB  - It is generally agreed that gingival overgrowth results from an increase in the
      levels of gingival extracellular macromolecules infiltrated with various numbers 
      of inflammatory cells. The relative amounts of extracellular matrix
      macromolecules observed in 12 cases of gingival hyperplasia associated with the
      use of cyclosporin, hydantoin or nifedipine were compared with those obtained in 
      a control group on the basis of histological and immunohistochemical
      investigations. From tissue sections, the quantification was by computerized
      morphometric analysis on a BFM 186 microcomputer to which were implemented the
      transformations of mathematical morphology. The area fractions (AA%) occupied by 
      total collagen, type III and type IV collagen, vessels, fibroblasts, fibronectin 
      and elastic fibres were estimated and compared. The overall histological aspects 
      of drug-induced gingival overgrowth were similar, but quantification of different
      extracellular matrix components showed differences. In the nifedipine and
      cyclosporin groups, the area occupied by fibroblasts were not significantly
      greater than in healthy gingiva and chronic gingivitis. The area occupied by
      collagen was significantly greater in the nifedipine group than in the other
      pathological groups. Fibronectin was also strongly expressed in the nifedipine
      group, and the elastic fibre network was preserved in this group.

TI  - Spirapril. A preliminary review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in
      the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 750-66
AB  - Spirapril is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
      prodrug which is converted to the active metabolite spiraprilat following oral
      administration, and which has been evaluated primarily for the treatment of
      hypertension. In dose-finding studies of patients with mild to severe
      hypertension, spirapril > or = 6 mg once daily produced reductions in blood
      pressure of approximately 10 to 18 mm Hg (systolic) and 7 to 13 mm Hg (diastolic)
      [24-hour postdose trough readings at the end of the treatment period]. Blood
      pressure normalisation (trough diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) had
      occurred in 29 to 50% of patients at the end of these investigations. The
      dose-response curve for spirapril appears to be flat for doses of 6 to 24 mg once
      daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited in number, and further
      studies are required before the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril
      can be fully evaluated. However, in single, well controlled clinical trials,
      spirapril produced similar reductions in blood pressure to those seen with
      enalapril or captopril. When given as monotherapy or in combination with
      hydrochlorothiazide, spirapril may offer potential advantages over the calcium
      antagonist nitrendipine. Spirapril is generally well tolerated and produces an
      adverse event profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Data from small
      studies suggest that spirapril can be used without dosage adjustment in patients 
      with renal impairment, as a consequence of its dual renal and hepatic clearance
      mechanisms. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are eliminated by a
      predominantly renal mechanism that results in accumulation of the active
      metabolite when renal function is impaired. However, the utility of spirapril in 
      this patient group has yet to be fully determined because of conflicting data
      regarding its effects on renal function. Thus, spirapril is an effective
      antihypertensive agent which is well tolerated. Further comparative trials are
      needed to fully determine its efficacy with respect to other ACE inhibitors, and 
      a better understanding of its effects on renal function will clarify its role in 
      hypertensive patients with renal failure.

TI  - Hypertension in pregnancy. Practical management recommendations.
PG  - 555-62
AB  - Hypertension is a common and potentially serious complication of human pregnancy.
      It can be a marker of underlying maternal disease processes aggravated by
      pregnancy, or it can be directly related to the pregnancy (pre-eclampsia). It is 
      associated with increased risks of fetal growth retardation and, if severe, can
      cause both maternal and fetal problems. The risks to both mother and neonate can 
      be reduced by appropriate supervision and therapy. Close monitoring of maternal
      and fetal welfare will help to determine the optimum time for delivery. Maternal 
      hypertension should be controlled with agents considered to be well tolerated in 
      pregnancy. Following the index pregnancy, all patients with early and/or severe
      hypertension should be investigated for an underlying cause. Provided that there 
      is clinical resolution of acute pregnancy-related hypertension, investigations
      are usually postponed until at least 3 months following delivery.

TI  - Comparison of moexipril, a new ACE inhibitor, to verapamil-SR as add-on therapy
      to low dose hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 418-21
AB  - The antihypertensive effects of moexipril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor, and verapamil-SR as add-on therapy to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were 
      investigated in patients with moderate to severe (stages II and III) essential
      hypertension. Of 147 patients treated for 4 weeks with 25 mg/day HCTZ, 108 whose 
      sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was 100 to 114 mm Hg inclusive were
      randomized to 7.5 mg/day moexipril (56 patients) and 180 mg/day verapamil-SR (52 
      patients) in addition to 25 mg/day HCTZ. If after 4 weeks of treatment the SDBP
      was > or = 90 mm Hg, the dose of moexipril was increased to 15 mg/day and that of
      verapamil-SR increased to 240 mg/day; the patients were followed for an
      additional 8 weeks. Blood chemistries, plasma renin activity, and plasma
      aldosterone were done during the study. Both moexipril and verapamil-SR were safe
      and well tolerated and decreased the sitting and standing blood pressure
      similarly (P < .001). This study demonstrated that the addition of moexipril and 
      verapamil-SR to low dose HCTZ is effective for the treatment of moderate to
      severe hypertension.

PG  - 334-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy in
      hypertensive patients referred to an outpatient cardiology unit, and to assess
      its evolution under antihypertensive treatment. METHODS: One hundred and seven
      mild to moderate hypertensive patients were randomized to receive either
      xipamide, verapamil or atenolol. Cross-sectional echocardiography was performed
      in order to assess left ventricular mass and function. RESULTS: Mean age was 56
      years, with a 4:1 female/male ratio. Mean follow-up was 120 days. Left
      ventricular hypertrophy was very common (65%) and decreased to 54% under
      antihypertensive treatment. Left ventricular mass decreased from 134.3 g/m2 to
      118.1 g/m2 (p < 0.001). Concentric hypertrophy was the most common geometric
      pattern (42%), decreasing to 30% with treatment. Xipamide decreased ventricular
      mass by decreasing left ventricular diameters, while verapamil and atenolol
      decreased left ventricular thickness, mainly in septal wall. Systolic function
      was not modified during the treatment period. Diastolic function was not modified
      by xipamide and verapamil, and improved with atenolol. CONCLUSIONS: Left
      ventricular hypertrophy is very frequent when determined by echocardiography and 
      all three drugs produced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in a
      different way with respect to left ventricle geometry, an effect which could have
      potential therapeutic implications.

TI  - NSAIDs, antihypertensive agents and loss of blood pressure control.
PG  - 849-56
AB  - It is common for patients seen by primary care physicians to be taking both
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antihypertensive agents. If
      blood pressure control diminishes in these patients, the physician must evaluate 
      the potential interaction between the two classes of medication. Although the
      increase in blood pressure secondary to NSAID use may be only 5 to 10 mm Hg, this
      increase may be enough to justify a change in medication. For this reason, it is 
      important to evaluate the interaction between the two types of drugs and
      determine its clinical significance in specific patients.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of force titrated doses of diltiazem extended-release. A
      placebo controlled study.
PG  - 282-6
AB  - Thirty patients with clinical and ambulatory essential hypertension were treated 
      in a double-blind fashion with force titrated doses of placebo or diltiazem once 
      daily (OD) extended-release (ER) 120, 240, 360, and 540 mg to characterize the
      full-dose range of the new formulation. An incremental dose-response effect was
      observed both in clinic and ambulatory blood pressure parameters. Doses of > or =
      240 mg significantly decreased clinic diastolic blood pressure, whereas systolic 
      blood pressure was significantly lowered by the 540-mg dose. Moreover, compared
      with placebo, ambulatory blood pressure was significantly decreased by the 360-
      and 540-mg dose levels. Trough/peak ratios for systolic and diastolic blood
      pressures were 50% and higher at dose levels of 240 mg and above. Adverse
      reactions with diltiazem OD ER were generally mild and similar to those observed 
      with placebo. The findings of this study indicate that the most favorable effects
      of diltiazem OD ER were observed in response to the 360- and 540-mg dose levels. 
      The dose escalation forced titration study design appears to be a valuable tool
      in obtaining rigorous dose-response data of new antihypertensive agents.

TI  - Assessment of effects of two anti-hypertensive regimens on overall cardiovascular
      risk.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - Anti-hypertensive drugs differ in their effects on other cardiovascular risk
      factors. To date there have been few attempts to quantitate the impact of such
      differences. Twenty five unmedicated patients with primary hypertension were
      randomised to initial therapy with either the calcium antagonist, felodipine, or 
      a diuretic and doses titrated to achieve similar levels of blood pressure (BP).
      Second drugs were added if needed (metoprolol and prazosin, respectively). The
      aim was to determine over 1 year whether similar anti-hypertensive effects were
      associated with differences in a multivariate index of overall cardiovascular
      risk. The target supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (85 mm Hg) required the
      second agent in four of 13 evaluable patients in the felodipine group and six of 
      10 in the diuretic group. There was a significant rise in serum cholesterol and a
      fall in serum potassium in the diuretic group, but not in the felodipine group.
      Cardiovascular risk scores were ranked in percentiles in relation to the
      age-matched general population. This score fell to a greater degree in felodipine
      patients particularly over the first 6 months, but remaining lower at 12 months. 
      Left ventricular hypertrophy assessed by echocardiography, another measure of
      cardiovascular risk, was generally unchanged by either regimen. At equivalent
      blood pressure levels, the calcium antagonist-based regimen had a greater benefit
      on cardiovascular risk, particularly in the first 6 months of therapy. This
      method may be widely applicable in the assessment of anti-hypertensive therapy.

TI  - Favourable interaction of calcium antagonist plus ACE inhibitor on cardiac
      haemodynamics in treating hypertension: rest and effort evaluation.
PG  - 163-8
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of verapamil sustained release
      (SR) 240 mg, enalapril and their combination on blood pressure (BP) and cardiac
      haemodynamics at rest and during exercise in 20 patients with moderate essential 
      hypertension (seven men and 13 women, mean age +/- s.d. 53.7 +/- 15.8 years).
      After a 4 week placebo run-in period, patients were randomly allocated to
      received verapamil SR 240 mg once daily or enalapril 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks
      in a double-blind fashion. Patients whose diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was
      still > or = 95 mm Hg at the end of this period received verapamil SR plus
      enalapril for an additional 4 weeks. At the end of the placebo, single and
      combined treatment periods, resting and exercise (bicycle ergometry)
      haemodynamics were evaluated by radionuclide ventricular angiography
      (technetium-99m) and the following parameters were assessed: BP, heart rate,
      double product, systemic vascular resistances (SVR), cardiac output (CO), stroke 
      volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF) mean ejection rate (mER) and peak filling
      rate (PFR). Both verapamil SR and enalapril monotherapies significantly reduced
      resting and exercise BP (P < 0.01), with a BP normalisation (DBP < or = 95 mm Hg)
      of five of 10 and 4 of 10 patients respectively. A greater BP fall and a
      normalisation of 11 of 11 patients was obtained in non-responders to monotherapy,
      when treated with verapamil SR and enalapril (P < 0.01). Verapamil SR also
      reduced heart rate at rest and during exercise (-11.8% and -18.4%, respectively, 
      P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 296-312
AB  - A parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, forced-titration, multicenter study
      was done to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily nifedipine coat-core
      (NIF CC) and once-daily nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (NIF GITS)
      dosed in the fasting state in patients with mild-to-moderate essential
      hypertension. Both formulations have been shown to effectively and safely lower
      blood pressure in placebo-controlled trials. After a 4-week placebo run-in
      period, 228 patients were randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with either NIF CC
      30 mg daily or NIF GITS 30 mg daily. This period was followed by a
      forced-titration period to nifedipine 60 mg daily for an additional 4 weeks of
      double-blind therapy. After the 30-mg treatment period (the primary time point), 
      there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in
      mean change from baseline in trough supine diastolic blood pressure, the primary 
      efficacy variable (NIF CC patients, -7.0 mm Hg; NIF GITS patients, -8.4 mm Hg; P 
      = 0.139). Also, because the upper bound of the treatment difference confidence
      interval was < 3.0 mm Hg, equivalence--as defined in the protocol--was
      established. After the 60-mg treatment period, the change from baseline in trough
      supine diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater for patients treated
      with NIF GITS than for patients treated with NIF CC (NIF GITS patients, -12.0 mm 
      Hg; NIF CC patients, -8.4 mm Hg; P < 0.001). Because the upper bound of the
      confidence interval was > 3 mm Hg, equivalence cannot be claimed. No
      statistically significant differences were noted for the comparison of mean
      24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring changes. Both formulations were well
      tolerated.

AB  - The safety and efficacy, as measured by peak/trough blood pressure reduction, of 
      a new, once-daily, controlled-release formulation of isradipine (isradipine-CR,
      ICR) were evaluated in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension
      during a nine-week trial. After a 3-week placebo washout period, patients with a 
      sitting diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 114 mm Hg were randomized to
      either 1 of 4 ICR treatment groups or placebo. Of 402 randomized patients, 384
      completed the study (placebo = 77, ICR-5 mg = 76, ICR 10 mg = 76, ICR-15 mg = 78,
      and ICR-20 mg = 77). Peak and trough post-dose blood pressure responses and heart
      rates were monitored for both the sitting and upright positions. Blood
      chemistries, urinalyses, complete blood counts, and electrocardiograms were done 
      during the study. Both sitting and upright blood pressure decreased with the 5-(P
      < .05), 10-, 15-, and 20-mg (P < .001) once-daily ICR doses. The peak blood
      pressure reduction for all ICR doses occurred at 8 to 10 hours post-dose. Maximum
      peak/trough blood pressure response, achieved with the 10-mg dose, was similar
      with that of 15 and 20 mg of ICR. No serious clinical or metabolic side effect
      were noted, except ankle edema, which was dose dependent but did not require
      discontinuation of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Diltiazem: ten years of clinical experience in the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 220-32
AB  - Diltiazem hydrochloride is a benzothiazepine derivative calcium-channel blocker
      with proven antianginal and antihypertensive capabilities. Its primary mechanism 
      of action is vasodilatation, which results in diminished vascular resistance and 
      improved perfusion to various vascular beds and target organs. The
      antihypertensive efficacy of diltiazem in various demographic groups has been
      studied and compared with diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitors, and other calcium-channel blockers. These studies have shown that the
      antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is similar to that of the other therapies.
      Diltiazem does not adversely affect electrolytes or carbohydrate or lipid
      metabolism, and it may have beneficial effects on the heart and kidneys.
      Diltiazem reduces myocardial hypertrophy and exerts antianginal effects on the
      heart through coronary vasodilation and reduction in the blood pressure double
      product. Diltiazem improves renal perfusion and attenuates proteinuria. These
      effects may be helpful in limiting the progression of renal injury. Overall, the 
      efficacy and tolerability of diltiazem, as well as its salutary effects on the
      heart and kidneys, make it an important therapeutic consideration for patients
      with hypertensive disease.

TI  - Comparison of five antihypertensive monotherapies and placebo for change in left 
      ventricular mass in patients receiving nutritional-hygienic therapy in the
      Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS).
PG  - 698-706
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased left ventricular mass (LVM) by echocardiography is
      associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, it is of interest
      to compare the effects of both pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches 
      to the treatment of hypertension on reduction of LVM. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Changes in LV structure were assessed by M-mode echocardiograms in a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 844 mild hypertensive
      participants randomized to nutritional-hygienic (NH) intervention plus placebo or
      NH plus one of five classes of antihypertensive agents: (1) diuretic
      (chlorthalidone), (2) beta-blocker (acebutolol), (3) alpha-antagonist (doxazosin 
      mesylate), (4) calcium antagonist (amlodipine maleate), or (5)
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate). Echocardiograms were
      performed at baseline, at 3 months, and annually for 4 years. Changes in blood
      pressure averaged 16/12 mm Hg in the active treatment groups and 9/9 mm Hg in the
      NH only group. All groups showed significant decreases (10% to 15%) in LVM from
      baseline that appeared at 3 months and continued for 48 months. The
      chlorthalidone group experienced the greatest decrease at each follow-up visit
      (average decrease, 34 g), although the differences from other groups were modest 
      (average decrease among 5 other groups, 24 to 27 g). Participants randomized to
      NH intervention only had mean changes in LVM similar to those in the participants
      randomized to NH intervention plus pharmacological treatment. The greatest
      difference between groups was seen at 12 months, with mean decreases ranging from
      35 g (chlorthalidone group) to 17 g (acebutolol group) (P = .001 comparing all
      groups). Within-group analysis showed that changes in weight, urinary sodium
      excretion, and systolic BP were moderately correlated with changes in LVM, being 
      statistically significant in most analyses. CONCLUSIONS: NH intervention with
      emphasis on weight loss and reduction of dietary sodium is as effective as NH
      intervention plus pharmacological treatment in reducing echocardiographically
      determined LVM, despite a smaller decrease in blood pressure in the NH
      intervention only group. A possible exception is that the addition of diuretic
      (chlorthalidone) may have a modest additional effect on reducing LVM.

TI  - Assessment of blood pressure during naproxen therapy in hypertensive patients
      treated with nicardipine.
PG  - 146-53
AB  - Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to attenuate the
      antihypertensive effects of a variety of antihypertensive agents including
      diuretics, beta-blockers, and vasodilators. Because of their unique mechanisms of
      actions, calcium channel blockers may not be subject to this interaction. This
      multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to
      assess the effect of NSAID therapy on blood pressure control in stable
      hypertensive patients treated with a calcium channel blocker. One hundred
      patients with stable blood pressure control on 30 mg nicardipine three times a
      day were treated with 375 mg naproxen twice a day or placebo for 4 weeks. The
      mean diastolic blood pressures and estimated mean arterial pressures in both
      groups changed < 1 mm Hg during the 4 weeks of study drug treatment. None of the 
      changes was significantly different from baseline and the two treatment groups
      were not significantly different from each other. Body weight in the
      placebo-treated patients did not change significantly whereas body weight in the 
      naproxen-treated patients increased significantly, from 90.3 +/- 3.2 kg to 91.0
      +/- 3.2 kg (mean = 0.7, P = .0003). At 4 weeks there was a mean loss of 0.1 kg in
      the placebo group and a mean gain of 0.4 kg in the naproxen group compared to
      baseline weights, neither of which was statistically significant (P = .60 and P =
      .071, respectively). These results indicate that despite a significant increase
      in body weight, the antihypertensive action of the calcium channel blocker
      nicardipine is not significantly affected by cotreatment with naproxen.

TI  - Combined terazosin and verapamil therapy in essential hypertension. Hemodynamic
      and pharmacokinetic interactions.
PG  - 133-45
AB  - alpha-Blockers and calcium antagonists are commonly used in the treatment of
      hypertension, but few data are available concerning first dose or steady state
      (SS) hemodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of these drugs when they are used in
      combination therapy. To examine these interactions, we measured supine and
      standing blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac index (CI) for 6 h in 
      24 hypertensive patients after 2 weeks of placebo, again after the first dose or 
      3 weeks of therapy (SS) with either 120 mg verapamil (V) twice a day, or 1 mg
      terazosin (T) titrated weekly to 5 mg daily, and finally when T was added to V
      (group VT) or V added to T (group TV), acutely and at SS. Changes in supine
      hemodynamics when T was added to V or when V was added to T were similar and
      included a further reduction in BP, a transient increase in HR, and little or no 
      change in CI. Both groups experienced significant decreases in standing blood
      pressure, especially 0.5 to 2 h following initiation of combination therapy
      despite significant increases in standing HR and CI. Standing BP tended to be
      lower in group TV after the first dose, but minimum standing systolic BP was not 
      significantly different between groups (group TV 97 mm Hg at 1 h; group VT 109 mm
      Hg at 1.5 h, P > .05). Four patients in group TV and two in group VT experienced 
      symptomatic orthostatic hypotension with the first dose of double-agent
      treatment. Pharmacokinetic interactions, including an increase in the
      bioavailability of T when V was added, did not correlate with the degree of
      orthostasis. After 3 weeks of combined therapy, the orthostatic change in BP had 
      attenuated and symptoms had improved in all patients. We conclude that T and V
      represent an effective combination for the treatment of essential hypertension,
      but that orthostasis may result when initiating combination therapy. The
      orthostasis seen in some patients appears to be due to the combined vasodilatory 
      effects rather than negative ionotropic or chronotropic effects.

TI  - Do changes in dietary salt influence blood pressure of hypertensive patients
      pharmacologically controlled with verapamil? The Salt-Switching-Study (SSS).
PG  - 143-7
AB  - To study how changes in dietary salt influence the blood pressure (BP) of
      pharmacologically controlled hypertensive patients, we have selected from a large
      multicenter trial two subgroups of 14 and 16 patients who attained BP control
      (office DBP < 90 mm Hg) after a 4-week treatment with verapamil SR 240 mg once
      daily, either under an unrestricted salt diet (high-salt; 14 patients) or under a
      moderately restricted salt diet (low-salt; 16 patients). All of them were
      switched to the opposite dietary salt regimen and continued on verapamil for 4
      more weeks (Salt-Switching-Period). Office BP and ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring (ABPM) were registered before and after the Salt-Switching-Period.
      Salt intake was checked by urinary sodium excretion (UNa). Patients switching
      from high- to low-salt reduced UNa from 180.9 +/- 22.9 to 89 +/- 28 mM Na/24h (P 
      < 0.001) and patients switching from low- to high-salt increased UNa from 85 +/- 
      38.4 to 175.8 +/- 57.5 mM Na/24h (P < 0.001). No significant changes in BP were
      found by ABPM either in the group switching from high- to low-salt or in the
      group switching from low- to high-salt. In the latter group, a significant
      increase was observed in office DPB but not in SBP. Short-term changes in salt
      intake seem to have little influence on the BP of patients pharmacologically
      controlled with verapamil.

TI  - Metabolic effects of anti-hypertensive treatment with nifedipine or furosemide: a
      double-blind, cross-over study.
PG  - 137-41
AB  - To evaluate the metabolic effects of two anti-hypertensive agents with different 
      actions, nifedipine 20 mg twice daily and furosemide 60 mg twice daily, 23
      patients with untreated essential hypertension performed a double-blind,
      cross-over study in treatment periods of 5 months. Metabolic effects were
      evaluated by serum lipoprotein determinations, the intravenous glucose tolerance 
      test and the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp technique. Nifedipine and
      furosemide reduced blood pressure to the same extent (-14 to -15 mm Hg for supine
      SBP and -9 to -10 mm Hg for supine DBP, both P < 0.0001). Whereas both drugs
      significantly increased the levels of glycolysated haemoglobin (HbA1c, +0.24%, P 
      < 0.005 for nifedipine and +0.43%, P < 0.001 for furosemide), only furosemide
      increased fasting blood glucose (+0.3 mmol/L, P < 0.01) and fasting insulin (+2.2
      mU/L, P < 0.05) but impaired the early insulin response to i.v. glucose (-15
      mU/L, P < 0.05). Insulin sensitivity on the other hand was significantly impaired
      by nifedipine treatment only (-1.6 mg/kg/min, P < 0.01). Whereas treatment with
      nifedipine did not change serum lipids, furosemide caused an increase in serum
      cholesterol (+0.2 mmol/L, P < 0.05) because of a rise in the LDL fraction (+0.32 
      mmol/L, P < 0.001). The insignificant change in heart rate induced by nifedipine 
      treatment correlated with the change in HbA1c (r = 0.50, P = 0.05) and was
      inversely related to the change in insulin sensitivity (r = -0.56, P < 0.05). In 
      conclusion, both furosemide and nifedipine caused abnormalities in glucose
      metabolism. In the nifedipine group the effects on glucose metabolism were
      related to the occurrence of tachycardia suggesting that sympathetic nerve
      activation could be involved in the metabolic impairments.

TI  - Clinical equivalence of two tablet formulations of felodipine. A
      placebo-controlled study of 24-hour blood pressure control and tolerability.
PG  - 169-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to assess whether a new formulation of
      felodipine extended release (FER) tablets with a 9 mm diameter is similar to the 
      presently used 11 mm diameter FER formulation with respect to antihypertensive
      effect and tolerability in patients with essential hypertension. A randomised,
      double-blind, placebo controlled, three-way cross-over study design was used.
      PATIENTS: Twenty-four patients with a supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of
      95-115 mmHg after a 4-week placebo run-in period were given FER 5 mg 9 mm
      tablets, FER 5 mg 11 mm tablets and placebo in randomised order. The tablets were
      given once daily and each double-blind treatment period lasted for two weeks.
      METHODS: Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed at
      the end of each treatment period. The primary effect variable was mean DBP over
      24 hours. Nineteen patients had 24-hour blood pressure data valid for analysis
      using an analysis of variance with patient, treatment, period and carry-over as
      factors. RESULTS: Both formulations of FER 5 mg tablets significantly reduced the
      mean 24-hour DBP compared to placebo. The 9 and 11 mm tablets resulted in, on
      average, 4.7 and 3.4 mmHg lower mean 24-hour DBP than placebo. There was,
      however, no significant difference between the two different FER formulations.
      Both FER formulations were well tolerated and similar to placebo in this respect.
      CONCLUSION: Both FER 5 mg tablet formulations (9 and 11 mm diameter), given once 
      daily, were clinically equivalent with respect to antihypertensive effect and
      tolerability in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.

TI  - Ritodrine and nifedipine as tocolytic agents: a preliminary comparison.
PG  - 409-15
AB  - The effectiveness of the tocolytic agent and other betamimetic drugs in the
      treatment of preterm labor remains controversial. Effectiveness or efficancy of
      ritodrine has not yet convincingly been proven. A major concern are the marked
      side effects of beta-mimetics. The calcium channel blocker nifedipine has been
      used for tocolysis shortly after its introduction in clinical practice and is
      considered to be a probable good alternative for ritodrine. The efficacy of
      nifedipine versus ritodrine in the treatment of preterm labor was assessed in a
      retrospective study. 32 patients received intravenous ritodrine and 29 oral
      nifedipine. As endpoints were used: postponement of delivery, maternal side
      effects and perinatal outcome. The results of this retrospective study suggest
      that nifedipine is more successful in postponing delivery than ritodrine.
      Maternal side effects seemed to occur more frequently and be more serious in
      patients treated with ritodrine as compared to nifedipine. Perinatal outcome
      seemed better in the nifedipine group than in the ritodrine group. The promising 
      data from small prospective studies and the results of this retrospective study
      warrant further large prospective studies on the definitive place of nifedipine
      in the treatment of premature labor. Until the results of such a trial are
      available we advocate the use of nifedipine in case of preterm labor, especially 
      in a patient with diabetes mellitus, ruptured membranes, cardiac disease or
      multiple pregnancy, in order to avoid the characteristic side effects of
      beta-mimetics.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of once-daily nifedipine: the coat-core formulation
      compared with the gastrointestinal therapeutic system formulation in patients
      with mild-to-moderate diastolic hypertension. Nifedipine Study Group.
PG  - 12-29
AB  - The efficacy and safety of two sustained-release formulations of nifedipine, the 
      coat-core system (NIF CC) and the gastrointestinal therapeutic system (NIF GITS),
      were examined in 228 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension in
      this 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. The coadministration
      of food affects the nifedipine pharmacokinetics with differing magnitudes for the
      two formulations. To evaluate drug safety under the most rigorous circumstances, 
      all medication was given with food. After a 4-week placebo lead-in period,
      eligible patients were randomized to a parallel-group treatment period of either 
      NIF CC or NIF GITS. 30 mg daily with food for 4 weeks, followed by forced
      titration to nifedipine 60 mg daily for an additional 4 weeks. For the final
      4-week period, half of the patients receiving each formulation were switched to
      the alternate formulation at a dose of 60 mg daily. Within treatment groups, all 
      four blood pressure variables (systolic and diastolic measurements for both
      trough and 24-hour periods) demonstrated significant reductions (P < 0.05) from
      baseline (established after the placebo lead-in period) for both formulations at 
      every subsequent visit and end point. When comparing the two formulations, the
      mean change from baseline in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure
      measurements, determined by using ambulatory monitoring, was not statistically
      different for both doses (P > 0.05). The mean change in trough blood pressure
      from baseline during the parallel-group treatment period was statistically
      significant in favor of NIF GITS for both the 30-mg and 60-mg doses (P < 0.05).
      The treatment-emergent adverse-event rates for both formulations were similar
      during the parallel-group period, with the exception of dizziness, which was
      higher for patients receiving NIF CC. Both formulations were well tolerated and
      reduced blood pressure over the 24-hour dosing interval even when coadministered 
      with food. When half of the patients receiving NIF GITS 60 mg daily were randomly
      crossed over to NIF CC 60 mg daily, there were no significant changes in either
      the trough or 24-hour mean blood pressure measurements (P > 0.05), adverse
      events, or dropout rates. When patients receiving NIF CC 60 mg were crossed over 
      to NIF GITS 60 mg daily, they exhibited no significant change in diastolic blood 
      pressure (P > 0.05). This study demonstrated that when given with food, both NIF 
      CC and NIF GITS reduce 24-hour mean blood pressure measurements
      similarly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

PG  - 87-9
AB  - The efficacy and safety of different doses of a new controlled release
      formulation of isradipine (isradipine-CR, ICR) were evaluated in patients with
      mild to moderate (stages 1 and 2) essential hypertension in a placebo-controlled 
      study. Of 402 randomized patients, 384 completed the study (placebo = 77, 5 mg
      ICR = 76, 10 mg ICR = 76, 15 mg ICR = 78, 20 mg ICR = 77). All doses of ICR
      decreased the blood pressure and the effect was greater with doses of 10, 15, and
      20 mg once daily (P < .001). The most common clinical side effect was mild ankle 
      edema, which was dose dependent, occurring in 35.5% of the patients taking the
      20-mg ICR dose. This study showed that ICR is long acting, effective, and well
      tolerated.

TI  - Vascular compliance in sodium-sensitive and sodium-resistant borderline
      hypertensive patients.
PG  - 169-76
AB  - Recently, we demonstrated a reduction in the compliance of the carotid, femoral
      and brachial arteries in sodium-sensitive subjects who had consumed a regular
      sodium intake of approximately 120 mmol per day, as compared to both
      sodium-resistant borderline hypertensive subjects and normotensive controls.
      Venous compliance was not different between the two borderline hypertensive
      groups and was only slightly lesser than in controls. Large artery compliance was
      studied using a non-invasive ultrasound vessel wall movement detector system,
      while venous compliance was determined by means of strain gauge plethysmography. 
      The borderline hypertensive subjects were subsequently treated with enalapril 10 
      mg/day, felodipine 5 mg/day or placebo during six months. Despite similar
      reductions in blood pressure, enalapril induced a significant increase of the
      muscular femoral and brachial artery compliance, but not of the elastic carotid
      artery, while felodipine did not influence large artery compliance at all in the 
      sodium-sensitive group. The effect of enalapril on muscular artery compliance was
      established through a dose-dependent increase in distension and not through a
      change in arterial diameter. Arterial compliance was not influenced by either of 
      the drugs in the resistant group. Venous compliance was also not altered by the
      medication. In conclusion, femoral and brachial artery compliance in
      sodium-sensitive borderline hypertensive subjects, which was found to be lower
      than that of sodium-resistant subjects, improved with antihypertensive treatment 
      with enalapril but not with felodipine, despite the similar reductions in blood
      pressure induced by both drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Does calcium channel blockade and beta-adrenergic blockade affect platelet
      function and fibrinolysis to a varying degree?
PG  - 87-9
AB  - The effects of isradipine and atenolol on platelet function and fibrinolytic
      activity were studied in 10 male patients with mild untreated hypertension. After
      a 2-week placebo run-in period, the volunteers were randomized to either
      isradipine 2.5 mg twice daily or atenolol 100 mg daily for a 6-month period.
      Those initially receiving isradipine then received atenolol and vice versa. After
      each therapy regimen, blood was drawn at rest and 1 h after exercise during a
      maximum exercise test. Platelet activity in vivo was estimated as release of B-TG
      and PF-4. Fibrinolytic activity was estimated as the fast-acting inhibitor
      against tissue plasminogen activator usually termed PAI-1. During atenolol and
      isradipine therapy, blood pressure (BP) was equally reduced (p < 0.05). Heart
      rate (HR) decreased during atenolol treatment but was not changed by isradipine. 
      Platelet activity in vivo estimated as B-TG and PF-4 decreased irrespective of
      therapy (p < 0.02). During atenolol, as during placebo therapy, exercise resulted
      in a significant increase in platelet activity, as shown by an increase in B-TG
      (p < 0.02) and in PF-4 (p < 0.01). Such increase was not observed during
      isradipine treatment. Both treatments tended to improve fibrinolysis, as shown by
      a decrease in PAI, 1 h after exercise. Reducing BP with isradipine or atenolol
      results in a similar decrease in platelet activity and PAI-level, tested at rest 
      and 1 h after rest, respectively. During exercise, platelet activity increased
      during atenolol treatment; such change did not occur during isradipine treatment.

PG  - 670-4
AB  - The effects of monotherapy with atenolol or diltiazem-SR on blood pressure, 24-h 
      blood pressure (BP) load, and exercise capacity were tested in patients with mild
      to moderate (stages I and II) essential hypertension. After 3-week single-blind
      placebo therapy, patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 94-114 
      mmHg were randomized to atenolol 50 mg/day (62 patients) or diltiazem-SR 90 mg
      b.i.d. (60 patients) in a double-blind parallel study. Depending on SDBP
      response, the dose was increased to 100 mg/day for atenolol and 180 mg b.i.d. for
      diltiazem-SR. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements and
      exercise tolerance test by the Bruce protocol were done at the end of placebo and
      active treatment. Compared with placebo, both atenolol and diltiazem-SR
      significantly decreased heart rate (HR), sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP), 
      SDBP, ambulatory BP, BP load for waking and sleeping hours, area under the BP
      curve, rate-pressure product (p < 0.001), and exercise time (NS). Atenolol
      exerted a greater effect on ambulatory BP, HR, rate-pressure product, waking
      diastolic BP load, and area under the 24-h BP curve. The drugs were well
      tolerated and caused no serious side effects necessitating discontinuation of
      treatment. These findings indicate that (1) monotherapy for hypertension with
      atenolol or diltiazem-SR is effective and well tolerated, (2) it decreases the
      24-h BP load, (3) it does not interfere with exercise capacity.

TI  - Calcium-channel entry blocker therapy for hypertensive patients with concomitant 
      renal impairment: a focus on isradipine.
PG  - 1164-72
AB  - In the treatment of hypertension in renally impaired patients, normalization of
      blood pressure alone may not be sufficient to prevent significant morbidity to
      the kidneys. Treatment must reduce pressure in the renal vasculature, otherwise
      glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow will continue to deteriorate.
      Isradipine a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, has been investigated as a 
      suitable treatment in this setting. Isradipine maintains glomerular filtration
      rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular
      resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained
      natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of
      progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease
      proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the
      efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers,
      isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with 
      any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage
      adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal
      insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has
      several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where 
      an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics,
      dialysis patients, and transplant recipients. Side effects with isradipine are
      usually mild and transient, occurring in a dose-dependent manner.

TI  - [Lisinopril and nifedipine have neutral effects on lipids].
PG  - 3433-5
AB  - In a randomized, double blind, parallel-group, multicentre study in Norway, 97
      patients with mild to moderate hypertension (mean blood pressure 159/104 mm Hg)
      were treated with either lisinopril 10-40 mg or nifedipine 20-80 mg and the
      effects on blood lipids were evaluated. Complete results of laboratory analyses
      are given for 80 patients. After a 4 week run-in and placebo period,
      antihypertensive treatment was given for the next 10 weeks. During treatment with
      lisinopril the changes in lipids were +2.1% for total cholesterol, +0.7% for
      HDL-cholesterol, +3.8% for triglycerides and -6.1% for ratio HDL/cholesterol-HDL.
      For nifedipine the corresponding values were -2.4% for cholesterol, -5.8% for
      HDL-cholesterol, +8.0% for triglycerides and +3.2% for ratio. None of these
      changes was statistically significant. Both lisinopril and nifedipine lowered the
      blood pressure significantly, 18.1/12.0 mm Hg with lisonopril (p < 0.01 for both 
      systolic and diastolic pressure) and 8.0/8.5 mm Hg with nifedipine (p < 0.01 for 
      both respectively). Both drugs were well tolerated. In conclusion, neither
      lisinopril nor nifedipine had any negative impact on lipid levels.

TI  - Morning versus evening administration of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic 
      system in the management of essential hypertension.
PG  - 864-9
AB  - The nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) is a recently developed
      controlled-release formulation for once-a-day dosing. We evaluated the influence 
      of morning versus evening administration of the drug in a randomized double-blind
      cross-over study including 15 essential hypertensives. Five patients had to be
      excluded from blood pressure analysis because of noncompliance (three cases) or
      intolerable side effects (two cases). To assess the exact duration of the
      antihypertensive efficacy noninvasive automatic ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring was performed. After a placebo period patients were given 30 mg
      nifedipine GITS either at 1000 or 2200 hours. Twenty-four-hours systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure profiles documented a sustained antihypertensive effect 
      of both nifedipine regimens throughout the whole period without affecting the
      circadian rhythm. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between
      morning and evening administration. Two patients stopped their medication because
      of intolerable side effects (fatigue and muscle cramps, respectively). Two more
      cases suffered from mild reversible headache which provoked no discontinuation of
      the drug. In conclusion our results document a sustained antihypertensive
      efficacy of 30 mg nifedipine GITS in patients with moderate essential
      hypertension. Time of administration has no impact on day- and nighttime blood
      pressure control.

TI  - Nifedipine in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation and normal
      left ventricular function.
PG  - 689-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vasodilator therapy with nifedipine reduces left ventricular volume
      and mass and increases the ejection fraction in asymptomatic patients with severe
      aortic regurgitation. METHODS: To assess whether vasodilator therapy reduces or
      delays the need for valve replacement, we randomly assigned 143 asymptomatic
      patients with isolated, severe aortic regurgitation and normal left ventricular
      systolic function to receive either nifedipine (20 mg twice daily, 69 patients)
      or digoxin (0.25 mg daily, 74 patients). RESULTS: By actuarial analysis, we
      determined that after six years a mean (+/- SD) of 34 +/- 6 percent of the
      patients in the digoxin group had undergone valve replacement, as compared with
      only 15 +/- 3 percent of those in the nifedipine group (P < 0.001). In the
      digoxin group, valve replacement (in a total of 20 patients) was performed
      because of left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 50 percent) in 75
      percent, left ventricular dysfunction plus symptoms in 10 percent, and symptoms
      alone in 15 percent. In the nifedipine group, all six patients who underwent
      valve replacement did so because of the development of left ventricular
      dysfunction. In addition, all the patients in both groups who underwent
      aortic-valve replacement had an increase of 15 percent or more in the left
      ventricular end-diastolic volume index. After aortic-valve replacement, 12 of the
      16 patients (75 percent) in the digoxin group and all six patients in the
      nifedipine group who had had an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction
      before surgery had a normal ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term vasodilator
      therapy with nifedipine reduces or delays the need for aortic-valve replacement
      in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation and normal left
      ventricular systolic function.

TI  - Intracellular ionic consequences of dietary salt loading in essential
      hypertension. Relation to blood pressure and effects of calcium channel blockade.
PG  - 1269-76
AB  - To study the ionic basis of salt sensitivity in hypertension, 19F-, 13P-, and
      23Na-nuclear magnetic resonance techniques were used to measure cytosolic free
      calcium (Cai), pH (pHi), free magnesium (Mgi), and sodium (Nai) in erythrocytes
      of essential hypertensive subjects (n = 19). Individuals were studied for 2 mo
      each on low- (UNaV < 50 meq/d) and high- (UNaV > 200 meq/d) salt diets, with the 
      concomitant administration of nifedipine (10 mg t.i.d.) or placebo tablets for 1 
      mo of each diet. Salt loading elevated Cai and Nai while suppressing Mgi and pHi;
      these changes occurred predominantly in salt-sensitive subjects (n = 9).
      Nifedipine blunted the pressor response to salt loading > 50% (delta diastolic BP
      [high-low salt vs placebo] = 5 +/- 2 vs 14 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.05) and reversed
      salt-induced ionic changes, lowering Cai and elevating Mgi and pHi. Regardless of
      the definition of salt sensitivity, continuous relationships were observed
      between the pressure response to salt loading, the levels of Cai (r = 0.726, P < 
      0.001), Nai (r = 0.747, P < 0.001), and pHi (r = -0.754, P < 0.001), and the
      salt-induced change in Mgi (r = -0.757, P < 0.001). Altogether, these results
      emphasize the reciprocal and coordinate nature of intracellular ionic changes in 
      response to dietary salt loading and calcium channel blockade in essential
      hypertension. They suggest that salt sensitivity is mediated by cellular calcium 
      accumulation from the extracellular space, in association with magnesium
      depletion and acidification. Lastly, interpretation of intracellular ion
      measurements in the future will require concurrent assessment of dietary salt
      intake.

      essential hypertensive patients.
PG  - 919-23
AB  - The authors studied the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of a new
      sustained-release formulation of nifedipine 50 mg once a day, in comparison with 
      nifedipine retard 20 mg twice a day in patients with mild or moderate primary
      arterial hypertension. Both treatments significantly lowered blood pressure with 
      no difference in daily blood pressure profile. At steady state, the two drugs
      determined comparable plasma levels of nifedipine as measured immediately before 
      the morning dose. After a 12-month treatment, the new formulation of nifedipine
      still displayed satisfactory blood pressure control in both supine and standing
      positions, with no change in tolerability throughout the study. In conclusion,
      this new sustained-release formulation of nifedipine has similar efficacy and
      tolerability to conventional treatment with nifedipine retard 20 mg twice a day.

TI  - Within-patient correlation between the antihypertensive effects of atenolol,
      lisinopril and nifedipine.
PG  - 1053-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there are definable subgroups of patients with 
      essential hypertension who respond specifically to particular antihypertensive
      drugs. DESIGN: Randomized cross-over comparison of the antihypertensive effect of
      50 mg atenolol per day, 10 mg lisinopril per day and 20 mg nifedipine retard
      twice a day. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was used to assess the blood
      pressure level both for recruitment and at the end of each treatment period. The 
      treatment periods lasted 4 weeks and were preceded by 4 weeks of placebo.
      PATIENTS: Seventy-two untreated hypertensive patients with a mean age of 52 (SD
      8.4) years were recruited from six general practices and from the hospital
      outpatient clinic. Sixty-eight patients completed the trial. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: To assess the within-patient correlations among the blood pressure
      responses to each drug and explore the possible role of simple characteristics,
      such as the initial blood pressure, plasma renin concentration and age, in
      identifying the responders to a particular drug. RESULTS: Systolic/diastolic
      blood pressure fell significantly with each agent (P < 0.001): atenolol reduced
      it by 16.3 +/- 13.3/9.9 +/- 8.8, lisinopril by 14.8 +/- 15.0/9.4 +/- 9.1 and
      nifedipine by 11.6 +/- 12.3/6.7 +/- 8.3 mmHg. There was a low degree of
      correlation between the changes in blood pressure with the three drugs in
      individual patients. With each drug there was a small percentage (8.9-14.7%) of
      non-responders. The initial level of systolic blood pressure was weakly
      correlated with the antihypertensive effect of nifedipine (r = 0.47, P < 0.001)
      and plasma renin concentration was related to the effect of atenolol (r = 0.32, P
      < 0.01). Age did not predict the blood pressure response to any agent.
      CONCLUSIONS: The low level of the correlation between the blood pressure changes 
      with the three drugs suggests that different mechanisms may be involved in the
      aetiology of essential hypertension. Plasma renin concentration and the initial
      level of systolic blood pressure contribute only weakly to the identification of 
      responders to the three drugs.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of various antihypertensive drugs on fasting and
      postprandial lipids and lipoproteins, we studied 39 normolipidemic hypertensive
      patients, 28 men and 11 women aged 52.3 +/- 9.0 and 58.5 +/- 7 years,
      respectively. After four weeks of placebo administration, lipids and lipoproteins
      were measured in the fasting state and every three hours for a period of nine
      hours after intake of a standardized fat mixed load (65 g/m2). Following this
      test, the patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: group 
      I metoprolol (n = 10), 100 mg/day; group II nicardipine (n = 9), 90 mg/day; group
      III captopril (n = 11), 75 mg/day. At the end of week four of treatment the
      fasting and postprandial lipid measurements were repeated. Blood pressure mean
      values were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in the four treatment groups. We
      found no statistically significant lipids or lipoproteins changes neither in the 
      fasting nor in the postprandial state, but a trend toward lower concentrations in
      the postprandial lipemia after treatment was observed in three groups
      (metoprolol, nicardipine and captopril), whereas no change was observed in the
      chlorthalidone group. These data confirm that fasting lipids and lipoproteins in 
      normolipidemic hypertensive patients are not unfavorably changed by low doses of 
      the drugs studied. In addition, we inform that postprandial lipemia is not
      affected by these four drugs in the doses used.

TI  - Addition of pentoxifylline plus nifedipine to chemotherapy in patients with
      cisplatin-resistant cancers of the lung and other sites.
PG  - 313-6
AB  - Eight evaluable patients with cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (6
      patients), small cell lung cancer (1 patient), or both breast and ovarian cancer 
      (1 patient) were entered on a study to determine whether the addition of
      nifedipine plus pentoxifylline to cisplatin-based chemotherapy would result in
      increased chemotherapy efficacy. No patient responded to treatment.
      Myelosuppression may have been augmented by the nifedipine and pentoxifylline
      (median granulocyte nadir, 0.3 x 10(9)/L). Two patients developed febrile
      neutropenia. Nifedipine and pentoxifylline had to be stopped in two evaluable
      patients due to hypotension, and three additional inevaluable patients withdrew
      from the study due to nifedipine-pentoxifylline toxicity before receiving their
      chemotherapy. There was no indication that other types of chemotherapy toxicity
      were increased by the addition of nifedipine and pentoxifylline. A major problem 
      with the strategy followed in this protocol was that patients whose tumors had
      failed to respond to cisplatin-based regimens were often too ill to tolerate
      additional cisplatin, particularly when accompanied by nifedipine-associated
      hypotension.

PG  - 859-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of nifedipine and enalapril on carbohydrate and
      lipoprotein metabolism in Chinese non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)
      patients with hypertension. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 12-week, double-blind,
      randomized study of plasma lipid levels and glycemic control in patients treated 
      with nifedipine (n = 52) or enalapril (n = 50) was conducted. None of the
      patients were treated with insulin. Diet and dosages of oral hypoglycemic agents 
      remained unchanged during the 12-week treatment period. RESULTS: Mean arterial
      pressure was reduced more by nifedipine than by enalapril (23.1 vs. 11.1 mmHg, P 
      < 0.001). Similar reductions in body mass index and plasma triglycerides and
      increases in apolipoprotein A-I were seen with both treatments, but HbA1 was
      reduced more during treatment with enalapril than with nifedipine (0.49 vs.
      0.20%, P = 0.035) and serum apolipoprotein B (apoB) also declined more with
      enalapril than with nifedipine (8.2 vs. 2.3 mg/dl, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS:
      Twelve weeks of treatment with enalapril in hypertensive NIDDM patients was
      associated with greater improvement in glycemic control and greater reduction in 
      serum apoB concentration, although the reduction in blood pressure was less than 
      with nifedipine. These changes in cardiovascular risk profile warrant
      investigation for a longer term.

PG  - 51-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the effects on blood pressure and glucose homeostasis of
      felodipine, a calcium antagonist. DESIGN: A double-blind randomized cross-over
      study comparing felodipine ER and placebo. SETTING: A university centre of
      diabetic care in Malmo, Sweden. SUBJECTS: Seventeen hypertensive type II diabetic
      males on oral sulfonylurea (glibenclamide) treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Four-week
      treatment periods separated by a 2-week wash-out period. Felodipine 10-20 mg once
      daily was given. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure, heart rate, HbA1c and
      response to oral glucose tolerance test; glucose, insulin and c-peptide. Measured
      before randomization and at the end of each double-blind treatment period.
      RESULTS: Blood pressure was significantly reduced during felodipine treatment and
      heart rate slightly increased. Felodipine did not influence insulin or c-peptide 
      levels. There was no significant change in glucose levels but an increase in
      HbA1c. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that felodipine is an effective agent
      for type II diabetic patients on glibenclamide treatment. The effect on HbA1c is 
      noteworthy even if not of clinical significance in the short term. Controlled
      long-term studies in diabetic patients are needed to fully evaluate
      antihypertensive agents.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of extended-release felodipine and extended-release

PG  - 634-46
AB  - The efficacy and tolerability of extended-release felodipine (felodipine-ER) and 
      nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (nifedipine GITS) were compared in
      a multicenter, prospective, open-label clinical trial of 277 patients with
      mild-to-moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood
      pressure [SiDBP] > or = 95 and < or = 115 mm Hg). After a 3-week washout period, 
      patients were randomized to receive felodipine-ER (5 mg once daily) or nifedipine
      GITS (30 mg once daily); during a subsequent 6-week titration phase, the
      once-daily felodipine-ER dose could be increased to 10 mg and the nifedipine GITS
      dose to 60 or 90 mg in an attempt to achieve adequate blood pressure response
      (SiDBP < or = 90 mm Hg, or < 100 mm Hg with a > 10-mm Hg reduction from baseline,
      as measured 24 hours after dosing [trough]). At the end of titration, the mean
      daily doses of felodipine-ER and nifedipine GITS were 8 and 50 mg, respectively. 
      Mean changes in sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP)/SiDBP were -14/-12 and
      -16/-13 mm Hg, respectively. All reductions were significant when compared with
      baseline (P < 0.01), but there were no significant differences between treatment 
      groups. Adequate blood pressure response occurred in 77% of the felodipine-ER
      group and 80% of the nifedipine GITS group; this difference was not significant. 
      Blood pressure changes were similar among sex and race subgroups. A higher
      percentage of older patients (> 55 years of age) than younger patients (< or = 55
      years of age) reached goal SiDBP with both drugs. Patients with adequate SiDBP
      response continued receiving their assigned medication for an additional 6-week
      maintenance period. Reductions in SiDBP and SiSBP from baseline continued to be
      significant in both treatment groups. No clinically important changes in heart
      rate were noted. A total of 28 patients (15 in the felodipine-ER group and 13 in 
      the nifedipine GITS group) withdrew from the study because of inadequate blood
      pressure response. At least one adverse experience occurred in 55% of the
      felodipine-ER group and 63% of the nifedipine GITS group, prompting withdrawal of
      14 patients (10%) and 16 patients (11%), respectively. Headache and edema were
      the most common adverse experiences. The incidence and pattern of adverse
      experiences did not differ significantly between treatments. The results of this 
      study demonstrate that once-daily felodipine-ER and nifedipine GITS are similarly
      highly effective and generally well tolerated in patients with essential
      hypertension.

TI  - Effects of calcium antagonists on renal hemodynamics and progression of
      nondiabetic chronic renal disease.
PG  - 1185-202
AB  - In recent years, substantial investigative attention has focused on therapeutic
      regimens that could retard the progression of chronic renal insufficiency.
      Emphasis has been placed on the effects of antihypertensive treatment on renal
      hemodynamics and preservation of renal function. It has been suggested that some 
      classes of antihypertensive agents may confer a greater renoprotective effect,
      especially agents that lower glomerular capillary pressure. Conversely, by virtue
      of their ability to preferentially dilate the afferent arteriole calcium
      antagonists theoretically could favor an increase in glomerular capillary
      pressure thereby accelerating the decline of renal function. In this review we
      survey the literature critically and conclude that in patients with essential
      hypertension and in patients with chronic renal insufficiency, calcium
      antagonists effectively reduce systemic blood pressure while maintaining
      glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. Preliminary results
      from a few long-term studies suggest that calcium antagonists may even attenuate 
      the decline in renal function of patients with chronic renal failure. The
      majority of studies in humans, however, have been nonrandomized, of too short
      duration, or confounded by investigative difficulties precluding definite
      conclusions whether calcium antagonists have renoprotective effects. Although the
      possibility that calcium antagonists may retard progression of renal disease
      remains to be ascertained, the available evidence indicates that calcium
      antagonists may be used in patients with renal functional impairment without
      further exacerbating renal function.

      An open crossover study was performed comprising 16 non-diabetic hypertensive
      women (age range 59-75 years). The women continued to take a beta-blocker as a
      basal therapy. Each treatment period lasted three months. The blood pressure was 
      similar irrespective of treatment. Blood glucose values were not significantly
      different during the oral glucose tolerance test. Serum insulin levels after
      glucose administration were lower when the patients were treated with felodipine 
      than when taking hydrochlorothiazide. A possible explanation for this observation
      may be an increased insulin release as a consequence of treatment with a diuretic
      in order to maintain normal blood glucose levels during the glucose tolerance
      test. Felodipine appears preferable to hydrochlorothiazide as an addition to a
      beta blocker in hypertensive patients from a glucose metabolism point of view.

TI  - [Effect of verapamil and nitrendipine on the left ventricular mass and function
      (systolic and diastolic) in arterial hypertension].
PG  - 375-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effect of two calcium antagonists (verapamil and
      nitrendipine) on the regression of left ventricular mass and function (systolic
      and diastolic) by echocardiography-Doppler, in not treated hypertensive subjects.
      METHODS: 31 hypertensive subjects were studied in a randomized, placebo
      controlled, prospective and double blind trial. Verapamil (120-240 mg/day) was
      administered in 16 and nitrendipine (10-20 mg/day) in 15. The active drug therapy
      phase was 12 months with rest and effort tensional evaluation. Echo-Doppler was
      performed in the placebo phase, 6 and 12 months, evaluating left ventricular
      structure (septal and posterior-wall thicknesses, diameters and mass) and
      function (systolic and diastolic). RESULTS: Tensional control at rest and under
      effort was similar with both drugs, heart rate decreased only with verapamil.
      Left ventricular mass index decreased with verapamil and nitrendipine, due to
      reduction in the wall thicknesses (with verapamil from 158.5 +/- 31 to 135.7 +/- 
      20 g/m2 and with nitrendipine from 167.3 +/- 26 to 146.9 +/- 21 g/m2, p < 0.05). 
      Left ventricular systolic function was not modified during the follow-up with
      both drugs. Only in the verapamil group some left ventricular diastolic function 
      parameters improved (E from 0.82 +/- 0.11 to 0.95 +/- 0.14 and E/A/Age from 0.013
      +/- 0.005 to 0.017 +/- 0.005; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil and nitrendipine 
      exerts a similar tensional control at rest and under effort and left ventricular 
      mass regression. The improvement of some diastolic function parameters in the
      verapamil group was probably due to bradycardia.

TI  - Comparative effects of quinapril, atenolol, and verapamil on blood pressure and
      forearm hemodynamics during handgrip exercise.
PG  - 566-70
AB  - We compared the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with
      quinapril to those of selective beta-blockade with atenolol and calcium channel
      blockade with verapamil in 10 hypertensive subjects in a randomized double-blind 
      placebo-controlled crossover study. All antihypertensive agents reduced baseline 
      mean arterial pressure equally and did not modify forearm vascular resistance
      compared to placebo. In response to sustained handgrip exercise, both quinapril
      and verapamil, but not atenolol, attenuated the pressor response. However,
      verapamil was associated with an exaggerated increase in forearm vascular
      resistance during handgrip, whereas quinapril did not alter this response
      compared to placebo. It is concluded that quinapril and verapamil reduce the
      pressor response during isometric exercise by quantitatively different effects on
      the vasoconstrictor response in, as well as outside of, skeletal muscles.

      sensitivity in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 474-7
AB  - We performed a randomized, crossover study comparing the effects of nicardipine
      and trichlormethiazide on insulin sensitivity in 8 untreated essential
      hypertensive patients. They were treated either with nicardipine or
      trichlormethiazide for 12 weeks, after which they were treated with the
      alternative drug for a further 12 weeks. Insulin sensitivity was determined by
      the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique. Nicardipine had no adverse
      effect on insulin sensitivity. Trichlormethiazide decreased insulin sensitivity
      index by 12%. As nicardipine does not have an adverse effect on insulin
      sensitivity, it should be preferred in patients who have a proven metabolic
      abnormality.

TI  - Hypertension: current management strategies.
PG  - 202-17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects 50 million persons in the United States and is
      the most common reason for office visits and prescriptions. This report reviews
      the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition and provides special
      attention to concomitant risk factors and issues of adherence. METHODS: A
      literature search was performed using MEDLINE files dating back to 1986. The key 
      words were "hypertension," "antihypertensive agents," "patient compliance,"
      "cardiovascular risk factors," "isolated systolic hypertension," and "JNC."
      Additional references were accessed by cross-referencing the bibliographies of
      the articles obtained in this search. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Effective
      therapeutic pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management of hypertension,
      including stage 1 as reclassified by the Fifth Report of the Joint National
      Committee (JNC-V), can greatly reduce mortality for patients. Despite extensive
      national efforts, 35 percent of hypertensive patients remain unknown, and only 7 
      percent have their hypertension adequately controlled. Any additional
      cardiovascular risk factors compound the risk of adverse outcome and can be
      adversely affected by treatment. JNC-V recommendations regarding equally
      effective pharmacologic agents are flexible but controversial. The favorable
      cardioprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium
      channel blockers, alpha-blockers, and alpha-beta-blockers often make them a more 
      appropriate choice than diuretics or beta-blockers. Practical techniques for
      improving patient adherence to treatment regimens are also important and should
      begin when the diagnosis of hypertension is made.

TI  - Clinical assessment of gingival hyperplasia in patients treated with nifedipine.
PG  - 256-9
AB  - Gingival hyperplasia caused by the use of nifedipine has been extensively
      reported. In this paper, the gingiva of 18 patients suffering from cardiopathy
      and treated with nifedipine were compared with those of 10 patients with cardiac 
      disorders who had not been treated with calcium antagonists and with a
      no-treatment group of 12 patients. Nifedipine produced gingival hyperplasia,
      although patients who had not been treated with calcium antagonists also had mild
      hyperplasia. Hyperplasia first appeared in the interproximal areas, an
      observation which may be important for early detection. There was a direct
      correlation between the degree of hyperplasia and the bacterial plaque score.
      When we studied the influence of administration time and dose of nifedipine with 
      the degree of hyperplasia, no statistically significant differences were found.

TI  - Quality of life and cost-effectiveness in the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 81-7
AB  - By and large, the results of the different studies on quality of life in
      hypertension suggest that among beta-blockers only the nonselective beta-blocker 
      propranolol has a negative effect on well-being, being associated with depression
      and side-effects. The findings on diuretics are comparatively few, and mainly
      observed as an adverse impact on sexual function. If one broadens the treatment
      scenario to include mortality and morbidity, evidence of a beneficial impact has 
      only been proven for beta-blockers and diuretics. With the primary aim of
      antihypertensive drug therapy given as a reduction in cardiovascular risk
      factors, the aim with regard to quality of life is that quality of life be
      maintained. The new guidelines on the management of mild hypertension issued in
      the United States highlight the danger of relaxing the concern for risk reduction
      and costs in favour of surrogate end-points, even though these may carry great
      significance in the individual patient.

TI  - Double-blind crossover study of once daily nifedipine coat core in essential
      hypertension.
PG  - 289-92
AB  - Nineteen patients with essential hypertension on regular treatment with
      nifedipine tablets 20 mg twice daily and whose DBP was < 95 mmHg on at least two 
      occasions two weeks apart were entered in a double-blind randomised crossover
      study of three weeks treatment with nifedipine coat core (new formulation) either
      as 30 mg one daily or as 60 mg once daily dose. BP and plasma nifedipine levels
      were measured at 24, two, four and six hours after dosing. The pattern of BP
      response to both doses was similar over the 24h period. However, a greater BP
      lowering effect was achieved with 60 mg compared with 30 mg. The BP lowering
      effect of both doses was less at 24h after the last dose compared with peak
      effect. Plasma nifedipine levels were significantly associated with the BP
      lowering effect in the group as a whole (i.e. the higher the nifedipine levels,
      the lower the BP) and were significantly less at 24 hours compared with peak.
      Nifedipine in the coat core formulation is effective in lowering BP in patients
      with essential hypertension. The 60 mg dose is more effective than the 30 mg dose
      and induces higher nifedipine levels which are associated with greater BP
      lowering effect. However, the maximum BP lowering effect is not maintained up to 
      24 hours.

TI  - Effects of long-acting propranolol and verapamil on blood pressure, platelet
      function, metabolic and rheological properties in hypertension.
PG  - 273-8
AB  - The newly developed antihypertensive drugs, the long-acting beta-blocker
      propranolol and the sustained release calcium antagonist verapamil, are compared 
      in their antihypertensive, platelet function, rheological properties and
      metabolic effects. The trial was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled
      cross-over study. Thirty patients with mild to moderate hypertension received
      propranolol (40-120 mg) or verapamil (80-200 mg) once daily in two separate ten
      week courses. After ten weeks treatment both drugs had significantly reduced both
      SBP and DBP. Beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) concentration, reflecting the status 
      of platelet activation in vivo, was significantly decreased after propranolol
      (129.6 +/- 13.5 vs. 77.9 +/- 8.6 ng/ml) and verapamil (129.6 +/- 13.5 vs. 90.7
      +/- 10.1 ng/ml) treatments while platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen,
      arachidonic acid or adrenaline and the production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2),

      adenosine monophosphate (C-AMP) concentration were not affected. Significant
      alterations in rheological parameters such as plasma and whole blood viscosity,
      fibrinogen level and red cell deformability were not found. Higher cholesterol
      and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were observed after
      propranolol treatment but not in verapamil treatment. Side-effects were mild,
      tolerated and no patient had to be withdrawn from the study. In conclusion,
      propranolol and verapamil are generally effective antihypertensive as well as
      rheologically safe drugs. Compared with the metabolic effect on serum lipid,
      verapamil may be a better choice. Both drugs possess the tendency to inhibit
      platelet properties which is desirable in hypertension treatment.

      toxicity.
PG  - 499-507
AB  - STUDY HYPOTHESIS: 3,4-Diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) may reverse the hemodynamic
      effects of severe verapamil toxicity. DESIGN: A nonblinded acute animal
      preparation. INTERVENTIONS: Eighteen chloralose-anesthetized and instrumented
      swine were poisoned with verapamil at 10 mg/kg/hr for five minutes and then 5
      mg/kg/hr until a systolic blood pressure of 55 mm Hg was achieved. Heart rate,
      lead II ECG, mean arterial pressure, left ventricular dP/dT max, and cardiac
      index were monitored. Nine control animals received 0.2 mL/kg/min infusion of
      normal saline, and nine treatment animals received similar volumes of 1 mg/kg/min
      3,4-DAP until systolic blood pressure reached 100 mm Hg, an elapsed time of 30
      minutes, or death. RESULTS: Verapamil toxicity was produced in all animals
      following an average dose of 1.38 +/- 0.44 mg/kg verapamil, and resulted in
      diminished mean arterial pressure, dP/dT max, cardiac index, and heart rate to
      average values of 47%, 32%, 46%, and 88% of baseline values, respectively.
      Transient atrioventricular dissociation was noted in only 22% of cases. 3,4-DAP
      treatment (with an average dose of 14 +/- 5.6 mg/kg) resulted in significant
      increases in mean arterial pressure, dP/dT max, cardiac index, and heart rate to 
      136%, 298%, 149%, and 158% of baseline values, respectively. Mortality was
      unchanged (22% in both groups). 3,4-DAP treatment was complicated by muscle
      twitching, tachycardia (rate of more than 180) and hypertension (diastolic blood 
      pressure of more than 110 mm Hg) each in 44% of cases. CONCLUSION: Although
      3,4-DAP reversed the hypotensive and negative inotropic effects of verapamil
      toxicity, it failed to improve survival and resulted in several complications
      including muscle twitching, tachycardia, and hypertension.

TI  - Blood pressure control with diltiazem XR, a novel extended-release formulation of
      diltiazem HCl, in mature and elderly hypertensive patients.
PG  - 209-21
AB  - The safety and efficacy of an extended-release form of diltiazem HCl (diltiazem
      XR) in patients 55 years or older with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension
      were examined in a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study involving 350 patients with supine diastolic blood pressure 
      (DBP) between 95 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg. Patients were randomized to a once-daily
      dose of diltiazem XR (240 mg) or placebo; 261 patients received diltiazem XR and 
      89 received placebo. After 4 weeks, the dose was doubled (to 480 mg) in patients 
      whose supine DBP was > 90 mm Hg, and treatment was continued for another 4 weeks.
      Diltiazem XR consistently reduced blood pressure (BP) in the study population. At
      end-point, the mean reduction in supine DBP was 8.65 mm Hg in the diltiazem XR
      group and 2.75 mm Hg in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis
      confirmed the efficacy of diltiazem XR in men, women, patients between the ages
      of 55 and 64 years, patients 65 years or older, and non-black patients. Other BP 
      values (supine systolic, standing diastolic, and standing systolic) also were
      significantly reduced in patients treated with diltiazem XR. BP reduction (supine
      DBP < or = 90 mm Hg or by > or = 10 mm Hg) was achieved in 58% of patients
      receiving diltiazem XR compared with 27% of patients receiving placebo. Decreases
      in apical heart rate were minimal and similar in both groups. No significant
      differences were noted in adverse events in the diltiazem XR and placebo groups: 
      36.4% of patients in the diltiazem XR group and 37.1% in the placebo group had no
      adverse experiences, and 63.6% and 62.9%, respectively, had at least one adverse 
      event. Physical examination findings and laboratory values were clinically
      unremarkable and comparable in the diltiazem XR and placebo groups. Diltiazem XR 
      given once daily at doses of 240 mg and 480 mg was safe and effective in lowering
      blood pressure in mature and elderly patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.

TI  - The use of confidence intervals to describe the precision of trough/peak ratios
      for diltiazem CD in the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 231-5
AB  - Once-daily diltiazem hydrochloride, CARDIZEM CD (diltiazem CD) 300 mg, was
      evaluated for safety, efficacy, and the relationship between peak and trough
      antihypertensive effects in a multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel design
      trial. After a 4- to 6-week placebo baseline period, 111 patients with essential 
      hypertension were randomized to receive placebo or diltiazem CD for a 4-week
      treatment period. Diltiazem CD 300 mg lowered supine diastolic and systolic blood
      pressure at trough significantly more than placebo (-7.5 mm Hg vs. -1.3 mm Hg, P 
      = 0.0001 and -6.4 mm Hg vs. 0.5 mm Hg, P = 0.0051, respectively). Supine blood
      pressure was also measured hourly from 6 to 10 hours after the dose to assess
      peak effect and trough/peak ratios. Using the largest residual drug effect of
      -8.3 mm Hg at 6 hours as peak and the 24-hour residual drug effect of -5.9 mm Hg 
      as trough, the trough/peak ratio was estimated to be 71%, with a lower one-sided 
      95% confidence limit of 50%. The precision of the trough/peak ratio is estimated 
      by the lower confidence limit of 50%, which establishes the trough/peak ratio as 
      statistically > or = 50%. No statistically significant differences in supine DBP 
      were noted between the peak effect hours, indicating a plateau of the peak
      antihypertensive effect from 6 to 10 hours postdose. Diltiazem CD therapy was
      well tolerated, with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported during 
      the trial and no patients discontinuing the trial due to a treatment-related
      adverse event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Acute liver injury associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the
      role of risk factors.
PG  - 311-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospitalizations for acute liver injury in the absence of a viral
      infection or any other well-defined pathologic finding that could have caused it 
      is rare. In this study, we included both outpatients and hospitalized patients
      with acute liver injury to estimate the risk of clinically important acute liver 
      injury associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      and to study the role of certain risk factors. METHODS: This was a retrospective 
      cohort study with secondary case-control analysis. The study included 536 general
      practitioners' practices in England and Wales for the period October 1987 through
      August 1991. A total of 625,307 persons who received more than 2 million
      prescriptions for one of 12 NSAIDs were followed up to estimate the risk of newly
      diagnosed acute liver injury. RESULTS: There were 23 cases of acute liver injury.
      The incidence of acute liver injury was 3.7 per 100,000 NSAID users or 1.1 per
      100,000 NSAID prescriptions. None of the cases had a fatal outcome. Sulindac was 
      the only NSAID with a substantially greater risk than that for the overall NSAID 
      group. Users of NSAIDs who had rheumatoid arthritis had a 10-fold increased risk 
      of acute liver injury compared with NSAID-treated patients with osteoarthritis.
      Concomitant exposure to other hepatotoxic medications also increased the risk.
      Transient minor increases in liver test values were not a useful predictor of
      diagnosed NSAID-associated acute liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: Although NSAIDs have 
      been found to be associated with acute liver injury in a small number of persons,
      the risk is sufficiently small as to be of minimal concern for most NSAIDs.

TI  - Comparison of cilazapril and nifedipine retard on ambulatory blood pressure,
      metabolic, rheological and platelet function in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 137-43
AB  - In a 12 week randomised, double-blind study, a total of 31 patients with a
      sitting DBP of between 95 and 115 mmHg were enrolled for comparison of the
      antihypertensive, metabolic and antiplatelet effects of the drugs cilazapril and 
      nifedipine retard. A two week placebo treatment was given before either
      cilazapril (2.5 mg daily) or nifedipine retard (20 mg twice daily) was
      administered. After four weeks treatment, those patients with a sitting DBP > 90 
      mmHg were given a doubling of their initial doses for the next six weeks; the
      others were maintained at their initial doses. All patients received their drugs 
      and reported any adverse effects every other week. Blood was taken for metabolic,
      rheological and platelet function tests. Ambulatory BP and heart rate were
      recorded at the start, fourth and tenth weeks of study. At the end of this trial,
      there was a significant decrease in both SBP and DBP in the cilazapril group (155
      +/- 14 to 142 +/- 12 mmHg systolic, P < 0.01; 106 +/- 6 to 95 +/- 5 mmHg
      diastolic, P < 0.01). In the nifedipine group, there was also a significant
      decrease in SBP and DBP (161 +/- 18 to 139 +/- 5 mmHg, systolic, P < 0.01; 101
      +/- 6 to 88 +/- 9 mmHg diastolic, P < 0.05) but with a significant increase in
      heart rate (79 +/- 14 to 91 +/- 10 beats/minute, P < 0.05). There were no
      significant changes in the biochemical or metabolic parameters in the two
      groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Antihypertensive efficacy of a slow release nifedipine tablet formulation given
      once daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. A placebo-controlled, 
      double-blind parallel-group trial.
PG  - 133-6
AB  - In a double-blind, randomized parallel-group, multi-center study the
      antihypertensive efficacy of a slow release tablet containing 60 mg nifedipine
      (Aprical long, CAS 21829-25-4) has been investigated. After two-weeks wash-out of
      previous antihypertensive medication and a two-weeks placebo run-in period, 88
      patients of both gender with a diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 115 mmHg
      received either nifedipine or placebo for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured at
      the end of the dose interval at rest by a semi-automatic, auscultatory device.
      Control measurements were recorded using a standard cuff sphygmomanometer.
      Primary efficacy criterion was the drop in diastolic blood pressure (DBP,
      measured semi-automatically) after 8 weeks therapy. 88 patients were randomized
      to nifedipine or placebo. 86 patients completed the protocol (42 nifedipine, 44
      placebo). However, only in 73 patients BP measurements were recorded
      appropriately with the semi-automatic device (36 nifedipine, 37 placebo). In the 
      nifedipine group, blood pressure fell from 152 (+/- 18)/102 (+/- 6) mmHg to 139
      (+/- 16)/91 (+/- 10) mmHg. Blood pressure under placebo was determined to 149
      (+/- 20)/102 (+/- 8) mmHg before treatment and 146 (+/- 18)/100 (+/- 10) mmHg at 
      the end of the study. Heart rate was not affected under both treatments. The 90% 
      confidence interval of the difference between the mean fall in DBP ranged from
      5.0 to 12.5 mmHg, the point estimator was 8.8 mmHg. At the end of the study, 21
      of 36 patients under nifedipine and 10 of 37 patients under placebo had a DBP
      below 90 mmHg and/or a decrease in DBP > 10 mmHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - The prognostic significance of post-infarction angina pectoris and the effect of 
      verapamil on the incidence of angina pectoris and prognosis. The Danish Study
      Group on Verapamil in Myocardial Infarction.
PG  - 270-6
AB  - The prognostic significance of angina pectoris and the effect of intervention
      with verapamil on the incidence of angina pectoris were studied in patients
      recovering from myocardial infarction and included in the Danish Verapamil
      Infarction Trial II. During the second week after admission patients were
      doubly-blindly randomized to treatment with verapamil 360 mg.day-1 or placebo.
      Treatment was continued for up to 18 months. At discharge angina pectoris was
      reported in 11% of 869 patients randomized to verapamil and in 12% of 888
      randomized to placebo (ns). One month after discharge a significant increase in
      the prevalance of angina pectoris was reported in both the verapamil (33%) (P <
      0.001) and the placebo groups (39%) (P < 0.001). The one month prevalence of
      angina pectoris (P = 0.03) and the 18 months overall incidence of angina pectoris
      (P = 0.002) were both significantly lower in the verapamil group compared with
      placebo. Stable angina pectoris during the first month of follow-up was a
      significant predictor of major events (i.e. death or reinfarction) (hazard ratio 
      = 1.45; 95% confidence limits: 1.10, 1.89). As verapamil significantly reduced
      the incidence of angina pectoris during daily activities, and thereby the number 
      of patients at high risk, the beneficial effect of verapamil in reducing major
      events in patients recovering from myocardial infarction is likely to be due to
      abolishing myocardial ischaemia.

TI  - Characteristics and radiofrequency ablation therapy of intermediate septal
      accessory pathway.
PG  - 50-6
AB  - Fourteen patients (5%) with an intermediate septal accessory pathway were
      identified among 283 consecutive patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
      who had electrophysiologic study and radiofrequency ablation therapy. Nine were
      women and 5 were men (mean age 33 +/- 13 years). The resting electrocardiogram
      showed ventricular preexcitation in 8 patients and normal PR interval in 6.
      Anterograde and retrograde mapping studies revealed that the accessory pathway
      was para-Hisian in 11 patients and paranodal in 3. The accessory pathway was
      successfully ablated in 10 patients (9 para-Hisian and 1 paranodal) and damaged
      in 1 (para-Hisian). Treatment of 3 patients was complicated by transient
      atrioventricular (AV) block, of 1 by intermittent second-degree AV block, and of 
      another by permanent complete AV block requiring implantation of a permanent
      pacemaker. Six patients underwent a follow-up electrophysiologic study 84 +/- 55 
      days after ablation; none had induction of tachycardia even after isoproterenol
      infusion. It is concluded that radiofrequency ablation therapy for intermediate
      septal accessory pathway is feasible. However, the success rate is only modest
      (71%), whereas complications with heart block (36%) or complete right bundle
      branch block (29%) are high. Thus, the procedure should be reserved for patients 
      with life-threatening or troublesome symptomatic tachyarrhythmias.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of amlodipine and nifedipine retard in the treatment of
      mild to moderate hypertension.
PG  - 65-8
AB  - The efficacy and safety profiles of amlodipine (5-10 mg once daily) and
      nifedipine retard (20-40 mg twice daily) were compared in 111 hypertensive
      patients (sitting DBP in 95-115 mmHg) during eight weeks of treatment in a
      randomised double-blind parallel group study. BP was measured 22-24 hours after
      the daily dose of amlodipine and 10-12 hours after a dose of nifedipine retard.
      Baseline sitting BPs of 175/105 mmHg and 168/104 mmHg were significantly reduced 
      (P < 0.05) to 157/93 mmHg and 151/92 mmHg at the end of treatment in response to 
      mean daily doses of amlodipine 7.3 mg and nifedipine retard 58.9 mg. There were
      no clinically significant changes in heart rate with either treatment. Three
      patients in the amlodipine group and five patients in the nifedipine retard group
      could not be considered in analysis. The total numbers of adverse events
      (considered related or possibly related to treatment) (42 vs. 36) as well as the 
      numbers of patients experiencing such events (22 vs. 22) were similar in the
      amlodipine and nifedipine retard treated groups, respectively, but with a greater
      incidence of headaches in response to nifedipine retard and of oedema in response
      to amlodipine. Five patients in each treatment group discontinued therapy due to 
      such events. Overall the results showed once daily amlodipine as equivalent to
      twice daily nifedipine retard in the management of mild to moderate hypertension.

TI  - Verapamil and nifedipine in combination for the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 48-51
AB  - The authors examined the efficacy and safety of the combination of verapamil and 
      nifedipine in the control of hypertension. Retrospective analysis of blood
      pressures was obtained on 50 patients who had historically documented essential
      hypertension and were receiving verapamil and nifedipine. The patients had
      moderate to severe hypertension; 27 of 50 (54%) were uncontrolled on prescribed
      regimens of two or more separate classes of drugs. Control was defined by the
      ability to maintain a blood pressure of < or = 160/90 by providing doses of
      verapamil (max: 480 mg/day) and nifedipine (max: 180 mg/day). Twenty-nine (58%)
      were black and 21 (42%) were white. Ages ranged from 16 to 84 years. Mean
      duration of therapy was 1-2 years. Only 3 of 50 (6%) were control failures after 
      providing verapamil and nifedipine. Three of 50 (6%) were discontinued because of
      side effects--reversible hepatitis (2) and rash (1). There were no serious
      adverse events, i.e., CHF or arrhythmias. Manageable ankle edema was seen in 14
      of 50 (28%) patients. Verapamil and nifedipine, a combination of a
      dihydropyridine and a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, was effective and
      safe in this group of patients with difficult-to-manage hypertension.

TI  - Are the calcium antagonists really useful in cerebral aneurysmal surgery? A
      retrospective study.
PG  - 30-6; discussion 36-7
AB  - From 1983 to 1990, 234 patients with one or several cerebral arterial aneurysms
      were surgically treated in our department. Since 1983, we have been performing
      surgery as early as possible. As soon as the subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosis is
      confirmed by computed tomography (or if unconfirmed, by lumbar puncture), we
      assume that each patient may have an aneurysm. Between 1987 and 1990, 111
      patients were treated by vascular volume expansion (maintenance of central venous
      pressure above 5 cm H2O with 4% albumin or Ringer-lactate or, if necessary, with 
      20% albumin), which we supplemented with calcium antagonists (nimodipine in 60
      patients and nicardipine in 51 patients). Two months after being discharged, each
      patient is examined by a neurosurgeon and, on the same day, is subjected to a
      neuropsychological evaluation and a computed tomographic scan of the brain. A few
      months after this consultation, a working-position/family-activities
      questionnaire is issued to the patient. All of the results studied on the basis
      of postoperative mortality, second-month computed tomographic scan ischemia,
      neuropsychological evaluation, and return to work show no significant difference 
      between the groups with or without calcium antagonists or between the nimodipine 
      and nicardipine subgroups.

      angina pectoris.
PG  - 75-9
AB  - Diltiazem CR tablets 120 mg b.i.d. for 1 week were compared with plain tablets 60
      mg q.i.d. in 13 healthy male volunteers in a study of pharmacokinetic variables. 
      Their antianginal efficacy was also compared in 23 patients with stable angina
      pectoris who were already on metoprolol. Both studies were of randomised, cross
      over design, and the clinical study was double blind. The pharmacokinetic
      variables of the two formulations were very similar except for the longer tmax of
      4.4 h for diltiazem CR in comparison to 2.9 h for the plain tablets. The mean
      relative bioavailability of diltiazem CR in comparison with plain tablets was
      1.14. The clinical study showed that after four weeks on diltiazem CR 120 mg
      b.i.d. or diltiazem plain tablets 60 mg q.i.d. in addition to metoprolol, there
      were significant decreases in weekly anginal attacks from 11 to 5 attacks/week,
      the number of nitroglycerin tablets consumed from 6 to 3 tablets/week, and an
      increase in the maximum workload from 116 to 126 and 123 W for diltiazem CR and
      plain diltiazem tablets, respectively, as compared to placebo. Five of the
      patients were angina free during diltiazem treatment. No difference in
      anti-anginal efficacy between the two preparations was seen. It was concluded
      that CR 120 mg b.i.d. appears bioequivalent to plain diltiazem tablets 60 mg
      q.i.d.

TI  - A comparative study of long acting diltiazem (Tildiem LA) with sustained release 
      nifedipine (nifedipine SR) and bendrofluazide in the treatment of mild to
      moderate hypertension.
PG  - 251-65
AB  - The therapeutic efficacy of long acting diltiazem 300 mg od (Tildiem LA) was
      compared with sustained release nifedipine 20 mg bd and bendrofluazide 5 mg od in
      a multicentre study with 230 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate essential
      hypertension, with 77, 77 and 76 randomized to the diltiazem, nifedipine SR and
      bendrofluazide groups respectively. Patients were entered into this randomised,
      single (investigator) blind, parallel-group multicentre study if the systolic and
      diastolic blood pressures were > or = 145 mm Hg and/or 95 mm Hg respectively at
      the admission visit. Twenty-one general practitioners and two hospital physicians
      monitored patients at baseline and at four and eight weeks of continuous dosing. 
      After eight weeks of therapy, clinically acceptable control of blood pressure was
      seen in all groups: reductions were 19.2/13.5 mm Hg, 20.4/14 mm Hg and 18.5/10.8 
      mm Hg for the Tildiem, nifedipine and bendrofluazide groups respectively.
      Significant differences were shown between bendrofluazide and the other two
      groups on diastolic pressures (p = 0.01). The non-significant trend was for
      systolic pressures to mirror these effects. Significantly higher withdrawals
      caused by adverse events were seen with nifedipine. These were as follows: 14
      patients receiving nifedipine (18%), 5 patients receiving diltiazem (6%) and 4
      patients receiving bendrofluazide (5%). The difference in this withdrawal rate
      between treatments was statistically significant (p = 0.01). Post hoc tests
      revealed that both diltiazem and bendrofluazide had statistically significant
      lower withdrawals for adverse events than the nifedipine group (p = 0.047).
      Nifedipine was associated with a marginal increase in standing apex pulse rate
      and only diltiazem LA significantly maintained serum potassium levels. These
      results indicate that diltiazem 300 mg is an effective antihypertensive agent and
      is equivalent in efficacy to nifedipine SR 20 mg and both are superior to
      bendrofluazide. Nifedipine SR was however the worst tolerated and had the highest
      withdrawal rate (p = 0.013).

TI  - Antihypertensive therapy and circadian blood pressure profiles: a retrospective
      analysis utilising cumulative sums.
PG  - 289-95
AB  - The results of previous studies on the effects of antihypertensive agents on
      circadian blood pressure patterns are inconclusive, possibly due to the lack of a
      simple, objective, universally accepted method of quantifying circadian blood
      pressure profiles. In order to investigate for differences in the effects of
      antihypertensive drugs on circadian changes we utilised a recently described
      modified cumulative sums technique to quantify circadian alteration magnitude
      (CAM). CAM is simply calculated as the difference between crest and trough blood 
      pressures, the mean blood pressures of the 6-h periods of highest and lowest
      sustained pressures respectively. The records from all 24-h ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring performed over a 7 year period on subjects either on no
      medication (1208), or on treatment with a single first-line antihypertensive
      agent (578), were examined retrospectively. A sample (n = 40) stratified for
      trough diastolic blood pressure, age and sex was randomly selected from each of
      the following 5 groups: subjects on no medication, and subjects being treated
      with bendrofluazide, atenolol, class 2 calcium-channel blockers or captopril
      alone. Untreated subjects, those on bendrofluazide and those on a class 2 calcium
      channel blocker had similar circadian patterns. Subjects on atenolol therapy
      (25.9 +/- 1.7/18.3 +/- 1.3, systolic CAM +/- SE/diastolic CAM +/- SE) had
      attenuated circadian changes (p < 0.05) when compared to the untreated group
      (29.8 +/- 1.8/23.6 +/- 1.1), while those on captopril (34.9 +/- 2.4/25.7 +/- 1.8)
      exhibited markedly increased systolic and diastolic circadian blood pressure
      swings, which differed from those of the atenolol treated group (p <
      0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 1025-32
AB  - Twenty-four patients completed a double-blind, randomized clinical trial
      comparing the effects of nifedipine GITS (N) and verapamil SR (V) on blood
      pressure (BP) control and exercise performance. After a 2-week placebo phase, all
      subjects had measurements of VO2max, maximal workload, and endurance time. They
      were then randomized to either N (30 to 90 mg/day) or V (240 to 480 mg/day) and
      retested when BPs had stabilized. At rest, N lowered systolic (S) BP by 12 mm Hg 
      (P = .02 compared to baseline) and diastolic (D) BP by 11 mm Hg (P = .001). V
      lowered SBP by 8 mm Hg (P = .013) and DBP by 11 mm Hg (P = .002). Neither drug
      affected resting heart rate. V significantly decreased resting epinephrine (P =
      .05) and there was a tendency for V to reduce norepinephrine (P = .07) and
      dopamine (P = .08). N tended to increase plasma renin activity (P = .07). During 
      graded cycle ergometry N, compared with placebo, significantly lowered DBP at all
      exercise levels (P = .011), but had no significant effect on heart rate (HR),
      SBP, or heart rate pressure product (HRPP). Pulse pressure (PP) was significantly
      increased (P = .045), which was most noticeable at high exercise levels. Compared
      with placebo, V caused a marked reduction of exercise HR (P < .001), which was
      more pronounced at high levels, SBP (P = .004), DBP (P = .004), mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) (P = .001), and HRPP (P < .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The use of self-measured blood pressure determinations in assessing dynamics of
      drug compliance in a study with amlodipine once a day, morning versus evening.
PG  - 1403-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test whether the time of administration influences the therapeutic 
      response to a calcium antagonist taken once a day. Also, the dynamics of drug
      compliance and its impact on blood pressure control were investigated. DESIGN:
      Twenty outpatients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were included in a
      randomized, placebo-controlled open study. In a crossover design, all of the
      patients received 5 mg amlodipine, either in the morning or in the evening,
      during two consecutive 4-week treatment periods. METHODS: Blood pressure was
      taken by casual measurement, ambulatory 24-h monitoring (SpaceLabs 90202) and
      self-measurement at home, performed with a semi-automatic oscillometric device
      during the whole study period. Compliance was assessed using the
      Medication-Event-Monitoring System (MEMS). RESULTS: Neither casual nor ambulatory
      day- or night-time readings detected a significant difference between morning and
      evening administration. However, self-measurement documented significantly
      greater blood pressure reductions for morning than for evening administration.
      The MEMS showed different compliance on the days of ambulatory monitoring (100%
      with both drug regimens) compared with the whole treatment period. The number of 
      days with missed medication was thus significantly higher for the evening dosing 
      regimen. The difference in self-measured blood pressure between the two regimens 
      was lost if the days with missed medication were removed from the statistical
      analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Time of once-a-day amlodipine administration does not
      influence its efficacy for 24-h blood pressure control. Furthermore, the use of
      self-measurement and the MEMS may provide useful additional information on the
      pharmacodynamic impact of different dosing patterns in hypertensive patients.

PG  - 356-9
AB  - The efficacy and acceptability of amlodipine (5-10 mg o.d.) and sustained-release
      nifedipine (20-40 mg b.i.d.) were compared in a multicenter, double-blind
      clinical trial. After a two-week placebo period, 71 essential hypertensives of
      both sexes, aged 51.7 +/- 8.5 years, having diastolic blood pressure of 95-114
      mmHg were randomly allocated to either amlodipine 5 mg once daily (group A) or
      nifedipine 20 mg twice daily (group B). With respect to the blood pressure
      response, the initial dose was doubled after two weeks. No significant
      differences in blood pressures recorded at baseline and at the end of the placebo
      period were demonstrated. A significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic 
      blood pressures in the supine position was observed already two days after the
      start of treatment. In the group A it decreased from 163.2 +/- 21.4/102.7 +/- 8.5
      to 155.7 +/- 20.7/98.2 +/- 8.9 mm Hg (p < 0.05) and in the group B from 160.5 +/-
      16.2/100.5 +/- 12.2 to 152.2 +/- 17.0/95.4 +/- 9.5 mm Hg (p < 0.05). The similar 
      changes of blood pressure were observed in the standing position, as well. At the
      end of the study, the overall reduction of the supine diastolic blood pressure
      was 12.5% in the group A versus 5.2% in the group B (p < 0.05). In the standing
      position, amlodipine decreased diastolic blood pressure by 8.8% and nifedipine by
      6.4% (p < 0.05). Furthermore, amlodipine decreased the standing diastolic blood
      pressure to a greater extent (8.8% versus 6.4%; p < 0.05) than
      nifedipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Nicardipine in heart failure: distinguishing its acute beneficial from its
      chronic effects.
PG  - 535-41
AB  - Concern over negative inotropic effects has limited the use of calcium blockers
      in patients with congestive heart failure. Nicardipine, a second generation
      dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, has demonstrated positive hemodynamic
      effects in short-term therapy in patients with congestive heart failure.
      Prolonged use of calcium channel blockers remains contraindicated in patients
      with congestive heart failure due to the potential for activation of the
      renin-angiotensin system. However, acute intravenous nicardipine administration
      has important clinical applications (as in the management of surgical
      hypertension or hypertensive emergencies). Nicardipine may be safely used for
      these indications even in the presence of congestive heart failure.

PG  - 279-84
AB  - The pharmacokinetic variables and antihypertensive effect of the calcium
      antagonist isradipine, were investigated in 30 hypertensive patients. Isradipine 
      was given orally in parallel group design in plain and slow release formulations 
      in doses of 2.5 mg twice daily and 5.0 mg once daily, respectively. Isradipine
      concentration in serum was measured by a sensitive RIA method after the first
      dose and after 6 weeks of treatment. The pharmacokinetics and
      concentration/effect relationship after the first dose and after 6 weeks of
      treatment were compared. No differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between
      single and multiple dosing. Data were in accordance with results from studies in 
      healthy volunteers. Rate, but not extent of bioavailability differs between the
      two isradipine formulations. Antihypertensive efficacy of the two formulations
      was similar (16/11 and 19/15 mmHg), and a significant time dependent increase in 
      Emax from 10/3 mmHg to 23/14 mmHg after 6 weeks of treatment was observed.

      patients with essential hypertension in this 12-week, multicenter, randomized,

      respectively, and 4.1 mmHg on ATN+placebo. Beyond the first week of double-blind 
      therapy, all reductions produced by nifedipine coat-core combined with ATN were
      statistically significant (P < 0.05) compared with ATN+placebo. On ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring, trough-to-peak ratios of the change in diastolic blood
      pressure for the 30, 60, and 90 mg/day doses were 41%, 68%, and 78%,
      respectively. Adverse events were generally mild or moderate and most reflected
      the vasodilatory properties of nifedipine (eg, edema, headache). Nifedipine
      coat-core, when combined with ATN in patients not controlled by ATN alone, had
      significant antihypertensive activity for the entire 24-hour dosing interval and 
      was well tolerated by the majority of patients in the study.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of enalapril versus extended-release nifedipine for the
      treatment of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension: a multicenter 22-week
      study. Multicenter Cooperative Study Group.
PG  - 1094-107
AB  - The antihypertensive effects and tolerability of single daily doses of enalapril 
      and extended-release nifedipine (nifedipine-ER) were compared in an open-label,
      randomized, parallel-group, 22-week treatment study involving 230 men and women
      (mean age, 55 years). Following a 3-week washout period, mean +/- SD blood
      pressure levels were 153 +/- 17/99 +/- 4 mmHg in the enalapril group (n = 117)
      and 157 +/- 17/100 +/- 5 mmHg in the nifedipine-ER group (n = 113). Beginning at 
      5 mg once daily for enalapril and 30 mg once daily for nifedipine-ER, the dosage 
      was titrated every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, up to a maximum of 40 mg for enalapril
      and 120 mg for nifedipine-ER. The treatment goal (satisfactory response) was to
      lower trough sitting diastolic blood pressure to < 90 mmHg or by at least 10 mmHg
      to a level of < 100 mmHg. At a mean daily dose of 16 mg of enalapril and 57 mg of
      nifedipine-ER, more than three quarters of each treatment group achieved a
      satisfactory response. The mean reductions in trough sitting blood pressure
      levels at the end of 22 weeks of treatment were 15/11 mmHg for enalapril and
      21/13 mmHg for nifedipine-ER. The difference between treatments was significant
      only for the change in systolic blood pressure (P < 0.05). However, enalapril was
      better tolerated than nifedipine-ER. The numbers of patients with adverse
      experiences and withdrawals from the study because of an adverse experience were 
      significantly lower for enalapril than for nifedipine-ER (P < 0.05). The
      incidence of abnormal laboratory findings was small and considered of no clinical
      importance in either group. These data suggest that enalapril and nifedipine-ER
      had approximately equal efficacy as once-daily antihypertensive treatments, but
      enalapril was better tolerated.

      study vs. an ACE inhibitor].
PG  - 457-63
AB  - The anti-hypertensive activity and influence on some forms of stress of
      slow-release Nicardipoine and Captopril were compared using a randomized 2:1
      protocol. Thirty-six patients, mean age 55.9 years, suffering from slight or
      moderate arterial hypertension were treated with either 40 mg of Nicardipine
      retard twice a day (b.i.d.), or Captopril in a dose of 25 mg (b.i.d.) for 8
      weeks. A significant reduction was observed in arterial pressure, both in
      orthostatism and clinostatism, following both treatments in comparison to the
      placebo period, but the group treated with slow-release Nicardipine showed a
      greater and statistically significant reduction in arterial pressure. No
      significant change in heart rate was reported using either drug. Non-invasive
      out-patient monitoring of arterial pressure, performed using Spacelabs 5300,
      showed a significant reduction in arterial pressure using both drugs and the
      conservation of the normal circadian rhythm of arterial pressure. The pressure
      response to the cold pressor test (CPT), mental arithmetic test (MAS), and to
      dynamic and isometric effort was positive with both drugs, thus revealing a
      degree of protection offered by treatment using these two substances. In overall 
      terms, the two drugs were well tolerated.

      stress].
PG  - 533-9
AB  - Thirty-six patients (17 males and 19 females), aged between 40 and 70 years old
      (mean age 55.9), suffering from slight or moderate arterial hypertension, were
      monitored for four weeks after 14 days of placebo treatment. In a double-blind
      and random study 24 patients were treated with Nicardipine Retard (40 mg twice a 
      day) whereas a further 12 received placebo twice a day. Sphigomanometric controls
      carried out after two and four weeks showed a significant reduction in arterial
      pressure only in those patients receiving active treatment. 24-hour out-patient
      monitoring of arterial pressure, carried out using Spacelabs 5300, showed a
      reduction in both systolic and diastolic arterial pressure throughout the day in 
      subjects treated with calcium-antagonists compared to the placebo group. The
      normal physiological 24-hour trend of arterial pressure was always taken into
      account. The pressure response to a cold pressor test, mental arithmetic test,
      isometric and dynamic effort tests, measuring using a cycloergometer, was not
      modified by anti-hypertensive treatment, thus confirming the preservation of
      normal physiological behaviour during daily activities. There was no significant 
      change in heart rate and the drug was well tolerated.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
PG  - 721-35; quiz 783-4
AB  - The epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of atrial
      fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFl) are reviewed, and recent developments 
      and controversies in the approach to these arrhythmias are addressed. AF and AFl 
      are the arrhythmias most frequently encountered in clinical practice. Although
      occasionally unaware of their arrhythmia, patients usually complain of
      palpitations, weakness, dyspnea, and decreased exercise tolerance. The initial
      goal of therapy is control of the ventricular rate. Rate control is accomplished 
      with atrioventricular node-blocking agents such as digoxin, calcium-channel
      blockers, or beta-adrenergic blockers. Along with a rapid, irregular ventricular 
      response, other detrimental outcomes of AF and AFl include compromised
      hemodynamics and increased vulnerability to thromboembolism. After the cause of
      the patient's arrhythmia has been evaluated, pharmacologic treatment is directed 
      at converting the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm and maintaining it.
      Antiarrhythmic drugs have proved effective in about 50% of cases but may be
      associated with increased mortality. More effective and safer forms of drug
      therapy for AF and AFl are needed. Nonpharmacologic alternatives to
      antiarrhythmic medications for refractory AF and AFl include radio-frequency
      catheter ablation of the bundle of His with pacemaker placement and surgery.
      Patients who remain in AF despite therapy should receive long-term warfarin
      treatment. Drugs may be used to control the ventricular response in patients with
      AF and AFl, terminate and prevent the arrhythmias, and prevent thromboembolism.
      Nonpharmacologic treatments are reserved for patients whose arrhythmias are
      poorly controlled by drugs.

TI  - A comparison of isradipine and felodipine in Australian patients with
      hypertension: focus on ankle oedema. The Physician's Study Group.
PG  - 205-11
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the tolerability and efficacy of isradipine 
      and felodipine in the treatment of mild-moderate hypertension. After a 4 week
      placebo period, 143 patients entered a randomized, double-blind, multicentre
      study of 12 weeks duration. Patients received either isradipine (n = 72) or
      felodipine (n = 71) 2.5 mg twice daily. Doubling of this dose and the addition of
      enalapril (2.5 mg once daily) was permitted if DBP was > 90 mmHg at weeks 4 and
      8, respectively. Isradipine monotherapy reduced BP from 165/104 +/- 13/6 mmHg at 
      baseline to 149/91 +/- 14/10 mmHg at week 8 (p < 0.001), while felodipine alone
      reduced BP from 171/104 +/- 17/6 at baseline to 151/92 +/- 19/9 (p < 0.001).
      Following the addition of enalapril to 35% of patients in the isradipine group BP
      was further reduced to 144/88 +/- 13/8 mmHg at week 12 (p < 0.001). The addition 
      of enalapril to 24% of the felodipine group further reduced BP to 150/92 +/- 19/9
      mmHg at week 12 (p < 0.001). No differences in BP were found between the 2 groups
      while on monotherapy. However, the isradipine group had a significantly lower DBP
      than the felodipine group at the conclusion of the study (p = 0.008; 95% CI 0.7
      to 6.9 mmHg). Similar incidences of headache, flushing, dizziness and tachycardia
      were reported in both groups. However, the incidence of ankle oedema was
      significantly lower in the isradipine group (p = 0.028). Overall, ankle oedema
      was reported more often by female patients and was not associated with an
      increase in weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Treatment of arterial hypertension after surgery of the abdominal aorta:
      comparison of captopril and nifedipine administrated sublingually].
PG  - 1267-8
AB  - Treatment of high blood pressure after abdominal aortic surgery requires, because
      of adynamic ileus, the use of intravenously or sublingually (SL) administered
      drugs. The hemodynamic responses to captopril 25 mg SL (n = 10) and to nifedipine
      10 mg SL (n = 10) were studied for 2 hours in patients (mean age 66 years) with
      arterial hypertension (mean blood pressure, Pa > or = 115 mmHg) the day after
      abdominal aortic surgery. Patients with bilateral renal artery stenoses,
      identified with the preoperative angiogram, were excluded. Systemic arterial
      pressure and pulmonary vascular pressures were measured using a femoral catheter 
      and a pulmonary artery catheter respectively. Cardiac output (Q) was determined
      by thermodilution. [table: see text] Captopril and nifedipine significantly
      decreased pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and
      right atrial pressure. No deterioration of renal function was observed. In
      conclusion, captopril and nifedipine SL are effective and well tolerated for the 
      treatment of high blood pressure after abdominal aortic surgery.

TI  - ACE inhibition versus calcium antagonism in the treatment of mild to moderate
      hypertension: a multicentre study. Ireland-Netherlands Lisinopril-Nifedipine
      Study Group.
PG  - 450-5
AB  - The efficacy of lisinopril 10-40 mg once daily was compared with that of
      nifedipine tablets 20-40 mg twice daily in a multicentre double-blind randomized 
      parallel group study of 16 weeks duration involving 127 patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension. The groups randomized to lisinopril or to nifedipine were 
      not significantly different with respect to any demographic variable. An analysis
      of the pooled data from all centres demonstrated a significantly greater fall in 
      both lying and standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) on lisinopril than on
      nifedipine treatment (difference between treatments 7.70 +/- 3.34 mmHg; P = 0.02 
      and 10.2 +/- 3.30 mmHg; P = 0.003 for lying and standing SBP, respectively).
      However, this difference may be accounted for by the slightly higher mean SBP in 
      the lisinopril treatment groups compared with the nifedipine group at the end of 
      the placebo run-in period. Both treatments lowered lying and standing diastolic
      blood pressures (DBP) to the same extent and the response rates to the two
      treatments were the same. The effects of the two drugs on heart rate were
      indistinguishable from each other. There were six lisinopril and 12
      nifedipine-treated patients withdrawn during randomized treatment (P = 0.22).
      Nineteen per cent of lisinopril patients reported an adverse event compared with 
      36% of nifedipine patients. The relative risk of an adverse event on lisinopril
      compared with nifedipine was 0.42 (confidence limits 1.027-0.172) a difference
      which approached statistical significance (P = 0.0573). Lisinopril produced a
      greater reduction in both lying and standing SBP than nifedipine and both were
      associated with equivalent reductions in DBP. Lisinopril may be better tolerate
      than nifedipine.

TI  - Effects of amlodipine on renal haemodynamics in mild to moderate hypertensive
      patients. A randomized controlled study versus placebo.
PG  - 307-11
AB  - In this study the efficacy and safety of short-term amlodipine administration on 
      renal haemodynamics were evaluated in mild to moderate hypertensive subjects. Our
      final goal was to evaluate whether the reduced blood pressure induced by
      treatment was associated with maintenance of renal function. After a run-in
      period with placebo, 30 hypertensive patients without cardiac or renal diseases
      were randomly allocated to a double-blind 4 weeks controlled study with
      amlodipine 10 mg once a day (15 patients) or placebo (15 patients). Renal
      haemodynamic measurements included effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by radionuclide study using 131I-hippuran and
      99mTc, with methods described by Schlegel and Gates, respectively. In addition,
      effective renal blood flow [ERBF = ERPF/(1-Ht)], filtration fraction (FF =
      GFR/ERPF) and renal vascular resistance (RVR = MBP x 80/ERBF) were calculated.
      Plasma renin activity (PRA), serum aldosterone (ALD) and urinary excretion of
      sodium (NaU) were evaluated. At the end of amlodipine administration a
      significant decrease (P < 0.001) in SBP, DBP and MBP from baseline values was
      observed. A significant decrease (P < 0.01) in RVR and significant increases (P <
      0.05) in ERPF, ERBF and in NaU were also found, without relevant changes in GFR, 
      FF, PRA and ALD. No significant variation in clinical and renal measurements was 
      observed in the placebo group. No relevant side effects were observed in either
      group. In conclusion, amlodipine was effective in lowering blood pressure in mild
      to moderate hypertension and exerted favourable effects on renal haemodynamics
      and function.

TI  - Comparison of sublingual captopril, nifedipine and prazosin in hypertensive
      emergencies during hemodialysis.
PG  - 284-7
AB  - Hypertensive emergencies in hemodialysis require immediate therapy, usually by
      parenteral drug administration; however, sublingual medications may have
      potential in this special condition. Sublingual captopril (25 mg), nifedipine (10
      mg) and prazosin (2 mg) were prescribed to determine the effectiveness and safety
      of each medication in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies during
      hemodialysis. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously up to 120 
      min postdose. The response rates were 83% for captopril, 90% for nifedipine and
      11% for prazosin. The significant hypotensive effects of both sublingual
      captopril and nifedipine occurred at 10 min and continued up to 120 min. The
      reduction of systolic blood pressure occurred earlier in nifedipine than
      captopril (10 vs. 15 min). No significant difference in heart rate between them
      was noted. There were no side effects in the captopril group but flushing,
      tachycardia and headache were observed in 4 patients of the nifedipine group. We 
      concluded that sublingual captopril and nifedipine were effective but captopril
      seemed to have less side effects than nifedipine and may be an excellent
      alternative to sublingual nifedipine in the urgent treatment of hypertensive
      emergencies in hemodialysis. Prazosin was not recommended because of its low
      response rate.

      tablet compared with each drug alone.
PG  - 37-45
AB  - In this double-blind, randomised, three-way crossover (latin square design),
      multicentre study, the aim was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the
      fixed combination of felodipine and metoprolol with the individual components as 
      monotherapy. A total of 58 patients with supine diastolic blood pressure of
      100-115 mmHg were treated with (1) a fixed combination of felodipine plus
      metoprolol 5/50-10/100 mg (FM), (2) felodipine 5-10 mg (F) or (3) metoprolol
      50-100 mg (M), for 12 weeks each. All treatments were extended-release
      formulations administered once daily and blood pressure was measured 24 h after
      dosing. Dose titration was performed after 6 weeks if diastolic blood pressure
      was > 90 mmHg. After 12 weeks of active treatment, the mean supine blood
      pressures were 153/89, 159/93 and 163/94 mmHg with FM, F and M, respectively. The
      mean differences in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were -5.6/-3.1 mmHg (p =
      0.007/p = 0.002), -10.2/-4.4 mmHg (p < 0.0001/p < 0.0001) and -4.6/-1.4 mmHg (p =
      0.03/p = 0.15) for FM vs F, FM vs M, and F vs M, respectively. Blood pressure
      control (supine diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg) after 12 weeks was
      achieved in a significantly greater proportion of patients during treatment with 
      FM than with F or M; 71%, 45% and 40% were controlled with the respective
      treatments. With FM, 45% of the patients were taking the higher dose after 12
      weeks of treatment. The corresponding figures for F and M were 60% and 67%,
      respectively. Thirteen of the 58 patients (22%) were controlled only with
      FM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Braxton-Hicks contractions can alter uteroplacental perfusion.
PG  - 46-9
AB  - Color flow imaging was used to study the effect of spontaneous low-amplitude
      uterine contractions (Braxton-Hicks) on flow velocity waveforms obtained from the
      main uterine artery in 13 women between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation. Eight women
      had abnormal waveforms, as defined by the presence of an early diastolic notch,
      and five women had normal waveforms. In the former group, three women with
      chronic hypertension were started on the calcium antagonist nifedipine during
      this study. Contractions, which were monitored by external tocography, occurred
      more frequently in the group with abnormal waveforms and were temporally
      associated with an increase in impedance to blood flow. This effect occurred to
      the same degree in both normal and abnormal groups, but in the abnormal group the
      already impaired blood flow to the intervillous space was further diminished,
      resulting in absence of forward flow in diastole. Such acute reductions of flow
      in response to frequent, impalpable uterine contractions may cause a prolonged
      and silent insult to uteroplacental perfusion, which could hasten fetal
      compromise. This effect appeared to be abolished in patients on nifedipine,
      suggesting a possible therapeutic role for this drug in uteroplacental
      insufficiency.

TI  - [Drugs associated with acute generalized exanthematic pustulosis].
PG  - 612-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is a severe eruption
      which is usually drug related. If the causative drug is discontinued, acute
      generalized exanthematous pustulosis resolves spontaneously in ten days. The aim 
      of this study was to compare drugs suspected of causing acute generalized
      exanthematous pustulosis reported to French Pharmacovigilance centres and those
      reported in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of "pustular
      eruption" qualified as "serious" reported to the French Pharmacovigilance Centers
      between January 1985 and December 2001 were analyzed. Cases for which the
      diagnosis of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis was not clearly
      identified were reviewed by a dermatologist. The relationship between acute
      generalized exanthematous pustulosis and drug exposure was re-examined by one of 
      us. An exhaustive review of the literature was also performed. RESULTS: Review of
      the data base revealed 207 cases of serious acute generalized exanthematous
      pustulosis leading to death in 4 cases (2%). Of these cases of acute generalized 
      exanthematous pustulosis, only one drug was suspected in 107 cases (51.6%). The
      main drugs involved were: pristinamycin (18 cases), amoxicillin (+/- clavulanic
      acid) (16 cases), hydroxychloroquine (8 cases) and a combination of spiramycin + 
      metronidazole (5 cases). DISCUSSION: The most frequent causal drugs in our study 
      and in the literature are: amoxicillin +/- clavulanic acid, pristinamycin,
      hydroxychloroquine, ampicillin, diltiazem, co-trimoxazole, terbinafine,
      carbamazepine and spiramycin +/- metronidazole. Only pristinamycin and diltiazem 
      have information in their summary of product characteristics regarding the risk
      of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Because it is essential to
      discontinue the causative drug as soon as possible if a pustular eruption occurs,
      physicians must be informed of the risk, which should be added to the "adverse
      events", and "warnings" sections of the summary of product characteristics of the
      drugs concerned. CONCLUSION: Our results show the relevance of notification of
      side effects by physicians to pharmacovigilance centres, leading to the
      identification of a signal and public health dissemination of warnings.

      pressure and heart rate in patients with mild to moderate arterial hypertension: 
      the Lercanidipine in Adults (LEAD) Study.
PG  - 249-53
AB  - This multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study compared the effects of
      three dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (lercanidipine, felodipine, and
      nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system) on blood pressure and heart rate 
      in 250 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or
      =95 and 109 mm Hg). Patients were randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with
      once-daily doses of lercanidipine 10 mg, felodipine 10 mg, or nifedipine
      gastrointestinal therapeutic system 30 mg. After 4 weeks of treatment, the dose
      was doubled in nonresponding patients. At 8 weeks, no significant differences in 
      blood pressure were observed among the three groups. Increases in heart rate in
      all three groups induced by stressful conditions before and after treatment were 
      not exacerbated during active treatment. The incidence of adverse drug reactions 
      was lower in the lercanidipine and nifedipine groups than in the felodipine group
      (p<0.05); in particular, the incidence of edema for lercanidipine was 5.5% vs.
      13% for felodipine and 6.6% for nifedipine.

TI  - Delirium in the critical care patient: what the professional staff needs to know.
PG  - 208-13
AB  - Delirium has been recognized in the literature as a significant problem in the
      care and treatment of the critical care patient. Delirium, a medical disorder
      that results in the morbidity and mortality of the patients, especially in the
      elderly, is often misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated. Nurses and other
      health care professionals need in-depth education about delirium, validated and
      understandable assessment tools, and astute clinical observational skills. A
      comprehensive and aggressive clinical management plan that incorporates
      appropriate pharmacological agents will result in less morbidity and improved
      long-term outcomes.

TI  - A comparative analysis of amlodipine and felodipine in a military outpatient
      population: efficacy, outcomes, and cost considerations.
PG  - 530-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: This retrospective study compared the efficacy, tolerability, and
      cost of two dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. METHODS: Charts of patients
      who had been on continuous antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine or felodipine
      for at least 6 months were reviewed. Analyses include mean changes in blood
      pressure, percentage of patients achieving blood pressure (BP) < 140/90 mm Hg,
      average dose, and cost per day of the two calcium channel blockers, average cost 
      of additional medication, total medication cost per day, and cost to achieve BP
      control. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of amlodipine-treated patients achieved BP
      control compared with 33% of felodipine-treated patients. Total medication cost
      to achieve BP control was 0.87 dollars per day for patients on amlodipine
      compared with 1.79 dollars per day for patients on felodipine. CONCLUSIONS:
      Amlodipine produced BP control in a greater percentage of patients than did
      felodipine at a lower total cost to achieve BP control. When evaluating the total
      cost of antihypertensive treatment, the cost of a drug alone can be misleading.

TI  - Neurohormones and oxidative stress in nonischemic cardiomyopathy: relationship to
      survival and the effect of treatment with amlodipine.
PG  - 291-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of amlodipine on 
      neurohormones and oxidative stress in nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and determine
      the relationship between baseline and posttreatment levels of these markers with 
      survival. BACKGROUND: Neurohormones and oxidative stress are important in the
      pathophysiology of heart failure. Calcium-channel blockers are associated with
      poor outcomes in patients with heart failure, in part due to neurohormonal
      activation. In contrast, amlodipine, a second-generation dihydropyridine, has a
      more favorable clinical profile. METHODS: In the Prospective Randomized
      Amlodipine Survival Evaluation 2 (PRAISE-2) trial, a subset of 181 patients with 
      nonischemic cardiomyopathy were randomized to amlodipine (10 mg/day) or placebo. 
      Blood samples were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks and 26 weeks for
      norepinephrine, epinephrine, angiotensin II, dopamine, N-terminal pro-atrial
      natriuretic peptide (Nt-pro-ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), adrenolutin
      and malondialdehyde. RESULTS: There was no difference in levels of neurohormones 
      or oxidative stress markers between the amlodipine and placebo groups at the
      different times. Both Nt-pro-ANP and BNP decreased at 2 weeks and at 26 weeks.
      Baseline Nt-pro-ANP correlated with survival in multivariate analysis (P =.001). 
      A strong relationship was found between a reduction in BNP at 26 weeks and
      survival, with a hazard ratio of 0.153 (95% CI 0.051-0.461, P =.017). No
      relationship was found between markers of oxidative stress and survival.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that amlodipine does not affect circulating
      neurohormones and oxidative stress markers in patients with nonischemic
      cardiomyopathy treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin and
      diuretics. In addition, low circulating Nt-pro-ANP and a reduction in BNP over
      time confers a good prognosis.

TI  - Comparison of the blood pressure-lowering effects and tolerability of Losartan-
      and Amlodipine-based regimens in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.
PG  - 1469-89
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated systolic blood pressure is a more important risk factor for 
      cardiovascular and renal disease than elevated diastolic blood pressure. Isolated
      systolic hypertension (ISH) is the predominant form of hypertension in the
      elderly. Effects of angiotensin II on the vascular wall and endothelium may
      contribute to development of ISH. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study 
      was to compare the effects on trough sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) of a
      regimen of losartan, a selective angiotensin II-receptor antagonist, and an
      amlodipine-based regimen in patients with ISH. METHODS: This multicenter,
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study consisted of a 4-week
      placebo phase and an 18-week active-treatment phase. The losartan-based regimen
      consisted of losartan 50 mg, increased as needed to losartan 50
      mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg at week 6 and to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg
      at week 12 to achieve a target SiSBP <140 mm Hg. the amlodipine-based regimen
      consisted of amlodipine 5 mg, increased as needed to amlodipine 10 mg at week 6
      and to amlodipine 10 mg/HCTZ 25 mg at week 12. The primary efficacy measure was
      change in trough SiSBP from baseline to week 18. Information on the tolerability 
      of study treatments was collected at each visit, including the investigator's and
      patient's observations of clinical adverse experiences (CAEs), laboratory adverse
      experiences, and responses to a symptom questionnaire. RESULTS: Eight hundred
      fifty-seven patients (65.6% female) were randomized to treatment, 432 in the
      losartan group and 425 in the amlodipine group. Their mean age was 67.6 years,
      and they had a mean duration of hypertension of 6.7 years at baseline. The
      losartan and amlodipine groups (intent-to-treat population) had baseline mean
      SiSBP values of 171.2 and 171.9 mm Hg, respectively. At week 18 (the primary end 
      point), the mean change from baseline in SiSBP was -27.4 mm Hg for 426 patients
      who received losartan and -28.1 mm Hg for 419 patients who received amlodipine
      (estimated least-square mean difference, 0.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, -1.4 to 2.0),
      indicating that losartan's effect on systolic blood pressure was noninferior to
      that of amlodipine. The proportion of patients who responded (SiSBP <140 mm Hg or
      a > or =20-mm Hg decrease in SiSBP from baseline) was comparable between groups
      (73.9% losartan, 75.4% amlodipine). The incidence of CAEs and drug-related CAEs
      was significantly greater in the amlodipine group (amlodipine, 79.8% and 43.8%,
      respectively; losartan, 67.8% and 25.5%; P < or = 0.001). In addition, more
      patients in the amlodipine group discontinued therapy due to a drug-related CAE
      compared with patients in the losartan group (12.9% vs 4.4%, respectively; P < or
      = 0.001). Lower-extremity edema was the most common drug-related CAE in the
      amlodipine group (24.0% amlodipine, 2.5% losartan; P < or = 0.001); dizziness was
      the most common drug-related CAE in the losartan group (6.0% losartan, 4.0%
      amlodipine). CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with ISH, losartan and amlodipine
      produced comparable clinically relevant reductions in SiSBP; however, losartan
      was better tolerated, as evidenced by fewer CAEs and discontinuations compared
      with amlodipine. Losartan may be considered for the initial treatment of ISH.

TI  - Long term effects of nisoldipine on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis
      and the occurrence of clinical events: the NICOLE study.
PG  - 887-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Earlier angiographic studies have suggested that calcium antagonists 
      may prevent the formation of new coronary lesions and the progression of minimal 
      lesions. Conversely, a meta-analysis suggested that these drugs may increase
      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease.
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether nisoldipine retards the progression of coronary
      atherosclerosis or reduces the occurrence of clinical events. DESIGN AND SETTING:
      The NICOLE study (NIsoldipine in COronary artery disease in LEuven) is a single
      centre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial with coronary
      angiography at baseline, six months, and three years of follow up. PATIENTS: 826 
      patients who had undergone successful coronary angioplasty were randomised to
      nisoldipine 40 mg once daily or placebo. The intention to treat and per protocol 
      population consisted of 819 and 578 patients, respectively. RESULTS: In the per
      protocol population, 625 of the nisoldipine treated and 655 of the placebo
      treated patients (NS) showed angiographic progression in at least one coronary
      arterial segment, defined as an increase in diameter stenosis of > or = 13%. The 
      average minimum luminal diameter of the non-dilated lesions decreased by 0.163 mm
      and 0.167 mm in the nisoldipine and placebo groups, respectively (NS). The
      respective numbers of new lesions detected were 7 and 13 (NS). In the intention
      to treat population, the rates of death, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction 
      were similar in both treatment groups. However, nisoldipine use was associated
      with fewer revascularisation procedures and thus the percentage of patients with 
      any clinical event was lower (44.6% v 52.6%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Nisoldipine 
      has no demonstrable effect on the angiographic progression of coronary
      atherosclerosis or the risk of major cardiovascular events but its use is
      associated with fewer revascularisation procedures.

TI  - Symptoms and the distress they cause: comparison of an aldosterone antagonist and
      a calcium channel blocking agent in patients with systolic hypertension.
PG  - 1543-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there has been increasing recognition that a substantial
      part of the cardiovascular, central nervous system, and renal conditions induced 
      by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation reflects an action of
      aldosterone, the potential influence of therapy designed to block aldosterone has
      been limited by the fact that spironolactone (until recently the only aldosterone
      antagonist available) exerts a substantial array of adverse effects. We sought to
      compare the magnitude of the distress induced by a widely used calcium channel
      blocking agent, amlodipine, and a new aldosterone antagonist, eplerenone, in
      patients treated for systolic hypertension. METHODS: A total of 269 patients
      older than 50 years with systolic hypertension were randomized to either
      eplerenone, 50 mg/d, or amlodipine, 2.5 mg/d, and titrated to a maximum 200-mg
      eplerenone dose or 10-mg amlodipine dose. Patients were followed up for 24 weeks.
      Quality-of-life questionnaires (SF-36 Health Survey) and a validated instrument
      for assessing symptom distress (Symptom Distress Index) were administered at
      randomization and 24 weeks after starting treatment. RESULTS: The systolic blood 
      pressure response to eplerenone and amlodipine did not differ (eplerenone = -20.5
      mm Hg and amlodipine = -20.1 mm Hg). For the quality-of-life analysis, 119
      patients were randomized to eplerenone and 122 to amlodipine. No significant
      treatment group differences in the Symptom Distress Index were detected at
      baseline. There was an overall significant treatment effect on symptom distress
      in favor of eplerenone (P =.03). Indeed, Symptom Distress Index showed
      significant worsening distress in 36 of 71 symptoms in the amlodipine arm and
      none in the eplerenone arm. Significant treatment effect in favor of eplerenone
      was observed in 5 symptoms: ankle swelling, weight gain, nocturia, increased
      urination, and shortness of breath. Patients with symptom distress also showed an
      erosion of psychosocial measures of quality of life (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The
      aldosterone antagonist eplerenone is substantially better tolerated than the
      widely used calcium-channel blocking agent amlodipine, with comparable reductions
      in systolic blood pressure. This feature should improve therapeutics in patients 
      in whom blockade of aldosterone's effect would be helpful.

TI  - VALUE trial: Long-term blood pressure trends in 13,449 patients with hypertension
      and high cardiovascular risk.
PG  - 544-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) study
      compares cardiovascular outcomes in 15,314 eligible patients from 31 countries
      randomized to valsartan or amlodipine-based treatment. METHODS: The blood
      pressure (BP) trends are analyzed in 13,449 of VALUE study patients who had
      baseline BP and 24 months BP and treatment data. RESULTS: In a cohort of 12,570
      patients, baseline 24 and 30 months BP, but not 30 months treatment data, were
      available. Of 13,449 patients, 92% (N = 12,398) received antihypertensive therapy
      at baseline. The baseline BP was 153.5/86.9 mm Hg in treated compared to
      168.1.8/95.3 mm Hg in 1051 untreated patients. After 6 months both groups had
      indistinguishable BP values. At 12 months the BP decreased to 141.2/82.9 mm Hg (P
      <.0001 for systolic BP and diastolic BP versus baseline), at 24 months to
      139.1/80 mm Hg (P <.0001 v 12 months), and to 138/79 mm Hg at 30 months (P <.0001
      v 24 months). The systolic BP control (<140 mm Hg) at 30 months increased from
      21.9% at baseline to 62.2%, the diastolic BP (< 90 mm Hg) from 54.2% to 90.2% and
      the combined control (<140 and <90 mm Hg) from 18.9% to 60.5%. At 24 months 85.8%
      of patients were on protocol drugs: monotherapy = 39.7%, added
      hydrochlorothiazide = 26.6%, add-on drugs = 15.1%, and protocol drugs in
      nonstandard doses = 4.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The achieved BP control exceeds values
      reported in most published large-scale trials. The VALUE study is executed in
      regular clinical settings and 92% of the patients received antihypertensive drugs
      at baseline. When an explicit BP goal is set, and a treatment algorithm is
      provided, the physicians can achieve better control rates than in their regular
      practice.

TI  - Prevention of carotid artery thrombosis after oral administration of the
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist CRL42796.
PG  - 71-7
AB  - This study investigates the effect of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor
      antagonist CRL42796 in a canine model of carotid artery thrombosis. Both carotid 
      arteries developed occlusive thrombosis in each of the five control animals (time
      to occlusion: right carotid artery, 92.6 minutes; left carotid artery, 89.0
      minutes). A single oral dose of CRL42796 (3 mg/kg) prevented occlusive thrombosis
      in 4 of 6 vessels and increased time to thrombosis, albeit not significantly
      (right carotid artery, 134.1 minutes; left carotid artery, 145.0 minutes). When
      the initial dose of CRL42796 was followed by a second oral dose (3 mg/kg) 2 hours
      later, 10 of 10 carotid arteries remained patent throughout the period of
      electrolytic injury. CRL42796 reduced thrombus weight in both treatment
      protocols. Ex vivo platelet aggregation with arachidonic acid (AA) or adenosine
      diphosphate (ADP) was reduced at 120, 240, and 360 minutes after two doses of
      CRL42796. A single oral dose reduced ADP-induced responses at 240 and 360
      minutes, but significant effects were not observed with AA. Bleeding time
      increased 360 minutes after two oral doses of CRL42796, but not at 120 minutes.
      Bleeding time was unchanged with the single dose of CRL42796. The results
      demonstrate that oral administration of CRL42796 prevents carotid artery
      thrombosis in response to deep vessel wall injury and may have potential value to
      be characterized in extended preclinical and clinical study.

TI  - Response to six classes of antihypertensive medications by body mass index in a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - Blood pressure increases with increasing body mass index (BMI) and BMI is
      linearly related to blood pressure in population studies. Obesity has been said
      to cause resistance to antihypertensive medications. We compared short-term and
      1-year blood pressure response by BMI category and weight change with
      hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, diltiazem-SR, captopril, clonidine, prazosin, or
      placebo in 1292 male veterans. Drug doses were titrated to achieve goal diastolic
      blood pressure <90 mm Hg over 4-8 weeks. Patients who achieved goal blood
      pressure were maintained for 1 year. BMI did not predict change in systolic,
      diastolic or pulse pressures during titration for any drug. At 1 year obese
      patients (BMI >30) were 2.5 times more likely to have diastolic blood pressure
      controlled by atenolol than normal weight (BMI <27) patients (p=0.01). Only
      prazosin patients gained weight: 1.7 lb (end-titration, p<0.0001; 1-year,
      p=0.02). Obesity does not appear to cause resistance to antihypertensive
      medications.

TI  - Differential effects of antihypertensive agents on electrocardiographic voltage: 
      results from the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) trial.
PG  - 993-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serial decline in electrocardiographic voltage in patients with
      increased left ventricular mass has been associated with a lower risk of
      cardiovascular events. METHODS: We studied 468 patients with diabetes mellitus
      and hypertension in the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD)
      trial. Patients were randomized in a stratified design to receive initial
      treatment with either enalapril or nisoldipine and to either intensive or
      moderate treatment goals. We measured an electrocardiographic index for increased
      left ventricular mass, the adjusted Cornell voltage, serially by treatment group.
      The association between changes in electrocardiographic voltage and
      cardiovascular events was defined with Cox proportional hazards analysis.
      RESULTS: In 5 years of follow-up, the decline in adjusted Cornell voltage was
      significantly greater for patients treated with enalapril than for patients
      treated with nisoldipine (repeated measures analysis of variance P =.002). In the
      Cox proportional hazards model, treatment assignment (enalapril vs nisoldipine)
      was the strongest predictor of cardiovascular events, but the presence of
      coronary disease at baseline, the duration of diabetes mellitus, and change in
      voltage were also independent predictors of cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS:
      In the ABCD study, enalapril treatment was associated with a lower risk of
      myocardial infarction. The reduction in left ventricular mass as reflected by
      diminished electrocardiographic voltage may explain some, but not all, of the
      effect of enalapril in this study.

TI  - The importance of von Willebrand factor level and heart rate changes in acute
      coronary syndromes: a comparison with chronic ischemic conditions.
PG  - 287-99
AB  - The pathogenesis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and transient myocardial
      ischemia (TMI) is not completely understood. Therefore, the authors studied the
      biological indicators of thrombogenesis and sympathetic activity. The study was
      conducted on 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome and 30 patients with stable
      angina pectoris. Treatment was standardized with low-molecular-weight heparin and
      300 mg aspirin/day but with no IIb/IIIa inhibitors, an oral beta-blocker,
      diltiazem 60 mg tid, glyceryl trinitrate i.v. in patients with ACS but with
      mononitrates orally and low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with stable
      angina. Twenty-four-hour continuous ECG monitoring and ST segment analysis were
      performed on day 2 of admission and heart rate analysis was performed 10, 5, and 
      1 minute before and during the myocardial ischemia periods. Blood sampling for
      von Willebrand factor (vWf) determination was performed through a peripheral vein
      at 8 AM, noon, 6 PM and 10 PM and half an hour after the description of angina.
      The patients with ACS were grouped as transient myocardial ischemia positive (n =
      20) and negative (n = 30). The patients with stable angina were designated as the
      control group (n = 30). The detected vWf levels at 4 different daytime periods in
      patients with ACS were significantly higher than those in patients with stable
      angina. At the 6 PM to 10 PM period, the vWf level increase was significantly
      higher in patients with TMI than in the patients without TMI. At the 8 AM to noon
      period, the detected vWf levels decreased significantly in both TMI groups.
      During the nocturnal ischemia periods, the increase in vWf levels immediately
      after angina was significantly more apparent than the detected changes during
      daytime ischemia. Analysis showed that heart rates before the ischemia during
      stable angina episodes were significantly higher than those in TMI (-) (silent)
      angina. The heart rate difference between 10 minutes before and during the
      ischemia in the angina group was significantly different from that during TMI (-)
      (silent) ischemia. The heart rates at the times related to ischemia in the
      nocturnal period were significantly lower than those in the daytime period. The
      heart rate differences between the ischemia-related times and during the ischemia
      were significantly higher in daytime ischemic attacks than in nocturnal ischemic 
      attacks. The study confirms that the vWf level, which is an indicator of
      thrombogenesis, was significantly increased in patients with ACS. Nocturnal
      ischemia is associated with thrombogenesis. Daytime ischemia is associated with
      increased sympathetic activity, and symptomatic ischemia is usually associated
      with increased sympathetic activity.

TI  - The dilemma of immediate preoperative hypertension: to treat and operate, or to
      postpone surgery?
PG  - 179-83
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and complications of immediate
      preoperative reduction of arterial blood pressure (BP) in patients with
      well-controlled hypertension but with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 110 
      and 130 mmHg on arrival at the operating room (OR). DESIGN: Prospective,
      randomized, large-sample study. SETTING: University-affiliated, 550-bed community
      hospital. PATIENTS: 989 patients with well-controlled hypertension, who were
      scheduled for surgery, and who had no previous myocardial infarction, unstable or
      severe angina pectoris, renal failure, pregnancy induced hypertension, left
      ventricular hypertrophy, previous coronary revascularization, aortic stenosis,
      preoperative dysrhythmias, conduction defects, or stroke. INTERVENTIONS: Patients
      with DBP between 110 and 130 mmHg were randomly allocated to two groups: 400
      patients in the control group and 589 patients serving as the study group. The
      control group had their surgery postponed and they remained in hospital for BP
      control, and the study patients received 10 mg of nifedipine intranasally
      delivered. The patients were observed for cardiovascular and neurological
      complications during the intraoperative period and over the first three
      postoperative days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The two groups were similar in
      age, gender, type of surgery, duration of anesthesia, and intraoperative fluid
      administration. There were no statistically significant differences in
      postoperative complications. The hospitalization time was considerable shorter in
      the study group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate preoperative
      reduction of DBP with intranasal nifedipine is safe in patients with
      well-controlled arterial hypertension but they presented with severe to very
      severe hypertension for patients in the OR. We were able to avoid unnecessary
      surgery postponement and attendant costs.

TI  - The Australian Intervention Randomized Control of Rate in Atrial Fibrillation
      Trial (AIRCRAFT).
PG  - 1697-702
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Australian Intervention Randomized Control of Rate in Atrial
      Fibrillation Trial was a multicenter trial of atrioventricular junction ablation 
      and pacing (AVJAP) compared with pharmacologic ventricular rate control
      (medication [MED]) in patients with mild to moderately symptomatic permanent
      atrial fibrillation (AF). BACKGROUND: There have been very few prospective
      randomized trials, undertaken in highly symptomatic patients, comparing AVJAP
      with pharmacologic methods of ventricular rate control for patients with
      permanent AF. METHODS: There were 99 patients (70 men, mean age 68 +/- 8.6 years)
      at five centers. Forty-nine patients were randomized to AVJAP while 50 patients
      were randomized to pharmacologic control. The primary end point was cardiac
      function measured by echocardiography and exercise tolerance. The secondary end
      points were ventricular rate control, evaluated by 24-h ambulatory
      electrocardiographic monitoring, and quality of life. Data were collected at
      randomization and then at one month, six months, and 12 months
      post-randomization. RESULTS: At 12 months follow-up there was no significant
      difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (AVJAP: 54 +/- 17%; MED: 61 +/- 
      13% [p = ns]) or exercise duration on treadmill testing (AVJAP: 4.1 +/- 2 min;
      MED: 4.6 +/- 2 min [p = ns]); however, the peak ventricular rate was lower in the
      AVJAP group during exercise (112 +/- 17 beats/min vs. 153 +/- 36 beats/min, p <
      0.05) and activities of daily life (117 +/- 16 beats/min vs. 152 +/- 37
      beats/min, p < 0.05). The CAST quality-of-life questionnaire revealed that
      patients in the AVJAP group had fewer symptoms at six months (p = 0.003) and at
      12 months (p = 0.004). The observed relative risk reduction in symptoms at 12
      months was 18%. Global subjective semiquantitative measurement of quality of life
      using the "ladder of life" revealed that the AVJAP group reported a 6% better
      quality of life at six months (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, AVJAP for 
      patients with mild to moderately symptomatic permanent AF did not worsen cardiac 
      function during long-term follow-up, and quality of life was improved.

TI  - Restoration of nocturnal dip in blood pressure is associated with improvement in 
      left ventricular ejection fraction. A 1-year clinical study comparing the effects
      of amlodipine and nifedipine retard on ambulatory blood pressure and left
      ventricular systolic function in Chinese hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 159-66
AB  - We assessed the effects of amlodipine and nifedipine retard on 24-h blood
      pressure (BP) control, nocturnal fall in BP and their significance on left
      ventricular systolic functions in 54 Chinese hypertensive type 2 diabetic
      patients. Patients being recruited were openly randomised to amlodipine or
      nifedipine retard. Ambulatory 24-h BP and echocardiogram (in 42 patients) were
      measured before and 1 year after treatment. At the end of study, there was 17%
      reduction in systolic BP; 17% reduction in diastolic BP and 12% reduction in mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) (no difference between amlodipine and nifedipine). Of the
      42 subjects underwent echocardiograms, eight became 'new-dippers' at the end of
      study (non-dippers before treatment and restored nocturnal fall of MAP> or =10%
      after treatment). The other 34 patients were either non-dippers before and after 
      treatment (n=27); dippers before and after treatment (n=3) or dippers before
      treatment and non-dippers after treatment (n=4). The eight 'new-dippers' had
      improved ejection fraction (69.6+/-7.2 to 75.8+/-7.4%, P<0.05) and increased left
      ventricular diastolic diameter (43.7+/-7.9 to 47.9+/-8.8 mm, P<0.05) after the
      1-year treatment of calcium antagonist. Compared to the other 34 subjects, the
      eight 'new-dippers' showed significant improvement in ejection fraction
      (9.4+/-10.9 vs. -1.2+/-11.8%, P<0.05). In conclusion, both amlodipine and
      nifedipine retard are effective in controlling the 24-h BP in Chinese
      hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. For those who have restored nocturnal dip 
      in BP have significantly increased left ventricular systolic ejection fraction
      after 1-year treatment of long acting calcium antagonists. The clinical
      significance and underlying mechanisms require further studies.

TI  - Antihypertensive efficacy and safety of olmesartan medoxomil compared with
      amlodipine for mild-to-moderate hypertension.
PG  - 425-32
AB  - The antihypertensive efficacy of the angiotensin II receptor blocker olmesartan
      medoxomil has been shown to compare favourably with that of other
      antihypertensive agents. This randomized, double-blind study compared the
      antihypertensive efficacy of the starting dose of olmesartan medoxomil with that 
      of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate (amlodipine) in subjects with 
      mild-to-moderate hypertension. Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in
      period, 440 subjects aged >/=18 years were randomized to the starting dose of
      olmesartan medoxomil (20 mg/day), amlodipine (5 mg/day), or placebo for 8 weeks. 
      Subjects were evaluated by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and
      by seated cuff blood pressure (BP) measurements at trough. The primary end point 
      was the change from baseline in mean 24-h diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by ABPM 
      at Week 8. Secondary end points included change from baseline in mean 24-h
      ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 8 weeks, change from baseline in mean
      seated trough cuff DBP and SBP measurements, and response and control rates for
      DBP <90 and <85 mmHg. Control rates for SBP <140 and <130 mmHg were also
      calculated. Olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine produced significantly greater
      reductions in ambulatory and seated DBP and SBP compared with placebo. Mean
      reductions in ambulatory and seated BP were similar between the two active
      agents; however, in the olmesartan medoxomil group, significantly more patients
      achieved the SBP goal of <130 mmHg and the DBP goal of <85 mmHg. Both drugs were 
      well tolerated at the recommended starting dose. Although amlodipine was
      associated with a higher incidence of oedema, this did not reach statistical
      significance. Olmesartan medoxomil is an effective antihypertensive agent, with
      BP-lowering efficacy at the starting dose similar to that of amlodipine, and is
      associated with more patients achieving the rigorous BP goals of SBP <130 mmHg
      and DBP <85 mmHg.

TI  - Different effect of antihypertensive drugs on conduit artery endothelial
      function.
PG  - 1281-6
AB  - To compare the effect of antihypertensive drugs on endothelium-dependent
      vasodilation in the peripheral conduit arteries of patients with essential
      hypertension, in a prospective, randomized, parallel group study, endothelial
      function was assessed in 168 hypertensive patients before and after 6-month
      treatment with randomly assigned nifedipine GITS (30 to 60 mg, n=28), amlodipine 
      (5 to 10 mg, n=28), atenolol (50 to 100 mg, n=29), nebivolol (5 to 10 mg, n=28), 
      telmisartan (80 to 160 mg, n=29), and perindopril (2 to 4 mg, n=28). If
      necessary, hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) was added to each compound. We evaluated
      brachial artery flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation (high-resolution
      ultrasound) compared with endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate
      (25 microg/s). Brachial artery diameter was measured by automatic computerized
      analysis. Forty healthy subjects were evaluated as a control group. Oxidative
      stress production was evaluated by measuring plasma malondialdehyde and plasma
      lipoperoxides; plasma antioxidant capacity was assessed as ferric-reducing
      antioxidant power. Hypertensive patients showed a significantly (P<0.01) lower
      flow-mediated dilation (5.2+/-1.9%) as compared with healthy control subjects
      (7.1+/-2.6%). Response to glyceryl trinitrate was similar in control subjects and
      patients. At baseline, blood pressure, diameter, flow-mediated dilation, and
      response to glyceryl trinitrate were similar in the different treatment groups.
      All treatments similarly reduced blood pressure, but only perindopril increased
      flow mediated dilation (from 5.1+/-2 to 6.4+/-2.4%; P<0.01) without modifying the
      response to glyceryl trinitrate. Perindopril but also telmisartan nifedipine and 
      amlodipine reduced oxidative stress and increased plasma antioxidant capacity. In
      patients with essential hypertension, ACE inhibitors appear to be the only
      compounds able to improve conduit artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation.

TI  - Lack of improvement in the treatment of hyperlipidemia among patients with type 2
      diabetes.
PG  - 377-82
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated the adequacy of treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes, and assessed the temporal trends in adherence to published 
      guidelines. METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of 501 patients enrolled in
      the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes trial. All patients had
      fasting lipid profiles at baseline and during the 5 years (1993 to 1998) of the
      trial. Achieving the National Cholesterol Education Panel's goals for
      hyperlipidemia management was the primary outcome. RESULTS: The percentage of
      patients with a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level less than 130
      mg/dL was 53% (n = 266) at baseline and 54% (n = 270) at the end of 5 years (P = 
      0.75). Almost 14% (n = 69) of these patients continued to have an LDL cholesterol
      level greater than 160 mg/dL at the completion of the study. Only 19% (n = 25) of
      the 133 patients with known coronary artery disease had an LDL cholesterol level 
      less than 100 mg/dL at baseline, and only 16% (n = 21) achieved this level at the
      completion of the study (P = 0.37). CONCLUSION: Although prevention of
      cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes is a public health priority, our
      results suggest that hyperlipidemia is being treated suboptimally.

TI  - Effects of the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone versus the calcium
      antagonist amlodipine in systolic hypertension.
PG  - 1021-6
AB  - Eplerenone is a highly selective aldosterone blocker, which is under development 
      for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. To assess its usefulness in 
      older patients with systolic hypertension and widened pulse pressure, we compared
      the effects of eplerenone with amlodipine, on clinic blood pressure (BP) and
      pulse pressure and in a subset of the patients, ambulatory BP, vascular
      compliance, and urinary albumin excretion. The study involved 269 patients > or
      =50 years of age who were randomly assigned to either eplerenone (50 to 200 mg
      daily) or amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg daily) in a double-blind titration to effect
      design. After 24 weeks of therapy, reductions in clinic systolic BP were similar 
      for both treatments (eplerenone, -20.5+/-1.1 mm Hg; amlodipine, -20.1+/-1.1 mm
      Hg). Reductions in clinic diastolic BP were modestly larger on amlodipine
      (-6.9+/-0.7 mm Hg) compared with eplerenone (-4.5+/-0.7 mm Hg) (P=0.014). Pulse
      pressure was also reduced similarly from baseline by the 2 treatment groups
      (eplerenone, -15.9 mm Hg versus amlodipine, -13.4 mm Hg, P=0.07). Changes from
      baseline in pulse wave velocity after 24 weeks of therapy were statistically
      similar for eplerenone and amlodipine. In patients with microalbuminuria at
      baseline (>30 mg albumin/g creatinine), eplerenone reduced the urinary
      albumin/creatinine ratio by 52% compared with a reduction of 10% by amlodipine
      (P=0.04). Thus, eplerenone was as effective as amlodipine in lowering systolic BP
      and pulse pressure as well as pulse wave velocity in older patients with widened 
      pulse pressure hypertension. Furthermore, eplerenone reduced microalbuminuria to 
      a greater extent than amlodipine in this older patient group.

TI  - Review article: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
PG  - 977-86
AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a clinicopathological condition that
      comprises a wide spectrum of liver damage, ranging from simple steatosis to
      steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
      represents only a stage within the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
      and is defined pathologically by the presence of steatosis together with
      necro-inflammatory activity. The true prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease is unknown, but it is estimated that it affects 10-24% of the general
      population in different countries. The diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease is based upon convincing evidence of absent or minimal alcohol
      consumption, compatible histological changes in liver biopsy and the exclusion of
      other liver diseases. The natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      remains to be defined. Patients with pure steatosis on liver biopsy follow a
      relatively benign course, whereas patients with histological necro-inflammatory
      changes and/or fibrosis may progress to end-stage liver disease. An initial step 
      in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the management of
      associated conditions, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia.
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients with steatohepatitis and/or fibrosis
      on liver biopsy may benefit from investigational pharmacological therapy.
      Patients with decompensated cirrhosis from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may 
      be candidates for liver transplantation.

TI  - Randomized, comparative, double-blind study of amlodipine vs. nicardipine as a
      treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly.
PG  - 537-44
AB  - A 90-day, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was
      conducted to compare the efficacy of amlodipine (once a day) with nicardipine
      (two to three times a day), in the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension
      (ISH) in the elderly. Patients (n = 133) aged > or = 60 years, with ISH were
      randomized to receive either amlodipine 5 mg/day, or nicardipine 60 mg/day
      (titrated if necessary to 10 mg/day and 100 mg/day, respectively) for 90 days.
      Efficacy was assessed by measuring office blood pressure (BP), and 24-h
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The two treatments substantially and
      comparably reduced office systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP), 
      and also produced a slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Amlodipine
      reduced SBP, as assessed by ABPM, to a significantly greater extent than
      nicardipine. Both treatments were well-tolerated. The sustained effect of
      amlodipine, compared with nicardipine, was reflected in its significantly greater
      antihypertensive activity, particularly during the nocturnal period, as assessed 
      by ABPM. The study demonstrates that once a day dose of amlodipine is an
      effective antihypertensive treatment for elderly ISH patients.

TI  - Combination of lisinopril and nifedipine GITS increases blood pressure control
      compared with single drugs in essential hypertensive patients.
PG  - 579-85
AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of combination therapy
      using the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor lisinopril and the
      dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nifedipine GITS on the degree and homogeneity 
      of 24-hour blood pressure reduction in essential hypertensive patients. After a
      4-week placebo run-in period, 51 patients (mean age, 54.4 +/- 9.4 years) with
      essential hypertension and clinic diastolic blood pressure between 105 and 115 mm
      Hg were randomized to 4-week treatment with lisinopril (20 mg), nifedipine GITS
      (30 mg), or their combination according to a multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, crossover study. Trough clinic blood pressure and 24-hour
      ambulatory blood pressure were measured at the end of the run-in period and after
      4 weeks of treatment. In addition to clinic and 24-hour average blood pressure
      reduction, the trough-to-peak ratio and the smoothness index, a new measure for
      the homogeneity of blood pressure reduction, were also calculated. Although both 
      lisinopril and nifedipine GITS produced a significant reduction in clinic and
      24-hour average blood pressure values, the reduction obtained with the
      combination was significantly (P < 0.001) greater. Moreover, the combination
      therapy increased (P < 0.01) the smoothness index as compared with each single
      drug for both systolic (lisinopril, 1.02; nifedipine GITS, 1.1; combination,
      1.76) and diastolic (lisinopril, 0.98; nifedipine GITS, 0.87; combination, 1.54) 
      blood pressure values, whereas trough-to-peak ratio values (expressed as median) 
      for systolic (lisinopril, 0.41; nifedipine GITS, 0.52; combination, 0.55) and
      diastolic (lisinopril, 0.35; nifedipine GITS, 0.40; combination, 0.49) blood
      pressure values were not significantly increased by the combination therapy.
      Thus, antihypertensive treatment with the combination of lisinopril and
      nifedipine GITS is more effective and balanced over the 24 hours than the
      combination components administered alone, confirming that the smoothness index
      is superior to the trough-to-peak ratio in assessing homogeneity of pharmacologic
      blood pressure reduction.

TI  - Effect of benazepril addition to amlodipine on ankle oedema and subcutaneous
      tissue pressure in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 207-12
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of benazepril addition to
      amlodipine antihypertensive treatment on ankle-foot volume (AFV) and pretibial
      subcutaneous tissue pressure (PSTP), two objective measures of ankle oedema. A
      total of 32 mild to moderate essential hypertensives (DBP>90 and <110 mmHg), aged
      30-70 years were studied. After a 4-week placebo period, they were randomized to 
      amlodipine 5 mg o.d. or benazepril 10 mg o.d. or amlodipine 5 mg plus benazepril 
      10 mg o.d. for 4 weeks, according to a crossover design. At the end of the
      placebo period and of each active treatment period, blood pressure,AFV and PSTP
      were evaluated. AFV was measured using the principle of water displacement. PSTP 
      was assessed using a system, the subcutaneous pretibial interstitial environment 
      with a water manometer. Both amlodipine and benazepril monotherapy significantly 
      reduced SBP (-18.2+/-4 and -17.8+/-4 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01 vs baseline) and 
      DBP (-12.1+/-3 and -11.7+/-3 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01); the reduction was
      increased by the combination (-24.2+/-5 mmHg for SBP, P<0.001 and -16.8+/-4 mmHg 
      for DBP, P<0.001). Amlodipine monotherapy significantly increased both AFV
      (+17.1%, P<0.001 vs baseline) and PSTP (+56.6%, P<0.001 vs baseline). As compared
      to amlodipine alone, the combination produced a less pronounced increase in AFV
      (+5.5%, P<0.05 vs baseline and P<0.01 vs amlodipine) and PSTP (+20.5%, P<0.05 vs 
      baseline and P<0.01 vs amlodipine). Ankle oedema was clinically evident in 11
      patients with amlodipine monotherapy and in three patients with the combination. 
      These results suggest that ACE-inhibitors partially counteract the
      microcirculatory changes responsible for Ca-antagonists-induced oedema formation.

TI  - Short-versus long-term effects of different dihydropyridines on sympathetic and
      baroreflex function in hypertension.
PG  - 558-62
AB  - Antihypertensive treatment with dihydropyridines may be accompanied by
      sympathetic activation. Data on whether this is common to all compounds and
      similar in the various phases of treatment are not univocal, however. In 28
      untreated essential hypertensives (age, 56.4+/-1.8 years; mean+/-SEM) finger
      blood pressure (BP, Finapres), heart rate (HR, ECG), plasma norepinephrine (NE,
      high-performance liquid chromatography), and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic
      (MSNA, microneurography) were measured at rest and during baroreceptor
      manipulation (vasoactive drugs) in the placebo run-in period and after
      randomization to double-blind acute and chronic (8 weeks) felodipine (10 mg/d,
      n=14) or lercanidipine (10 mg/d, n=14). Acute administration of both drugs
      induced pronounced BP reductions and marked increases in HR, NE, and MSNA. After 
      8 weeks of treatment, BP reductions were similar to those observed after acute
      administration, whereas HR, NE, and MSNA responses were markedly attenuated (-7%,
      -32%, and -14%, respectively; P<0.05). There was a small residual increase in
      sympathetic activity in the felodipine group, whereas in the lercanidipine group,
      all adrenergic markers returned to baseline values. Baroreflex control of HR and 
      MSNA was markedly impaired (-42% and -48%, respectively) after acute drug
      administration, with a recovery and complete resetting during chronic treatment. 
      Thus, the sympathoexcitation induced by 2 different dihydropyridines is largely
      limited to the acute administration. The 2 drugs have, nevertheless, a different 
      chronic sympathetic effect, indicating that dihydropyridines do not homogeneously
      affect this function. The acute sympathoexcitation, but not the small
      between-drugs differential chronic adrenergic effect, is accounted for by
      baroreflex impairment.

TI  - Intensive blood pressure control reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in
      patients with peripheral arterial disease and type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 753-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and diabetes are both associated
      with a high risk of ischemic events, but the role of intensive blood pressure
      control in PAD has not been established. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Appropriate
      Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes study followed 950 subjects with type 2
      diabetes for 5 years; 480 of the subjects were normotensive (baseline diastolic
      blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg). Patients randomized to placebo (moderate blood
      pressure control) had a mean blood pressure of 137+/-0.7/81+/-0.3 mm Hg over the 
      last 4 years of treatment. In contrast, patients randomized to intensive
      treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine had a mean 4-year blood pressure of
      128+/-0.8/75+/-0.3 mm Hg (P<0.0001 compared with moderate control). PAD, which is
      defined as an ankle-brachial index <0.90 at the baseline visit, was diagnosed in 
      53 patients. In patients with PAD, there were 3 cardiovascular events (13.6%) on 
      intensive treatment compared with 12 events (38.7%) on moderate treatment
      (P=0.046). After adjustment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors, an inverse 
      relationship between ankle-brachial index and cardiovascular events was observed 
      with moderate treatment (P=0.009), but not with intensive treatment (P=0.91).
      Thus, with intensive blood pressure control, the risk of an event was not
      increased, even at the lowest ankle-brachial index values, and was the same as in
      a patient without PAD. CONCLUSIONS: In PAD patients with diabetes, intensive
      blood pressure lowering to a mean of 128/75 mm Hg resulted in a marked reduction 
      in cardiovascular events.

TI  - Plasma levels of active extracellular matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 in
      patients with essential hypertension before and after antihypertensive treatment.
PG  - 119-24
AB  - This study was designed to test the hypothesis that plasma concentrations of
      matrix metallo-proteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), two
      enzymes that share similar substrate specificity (collagen type IV and V),
      possibly related to vascular remodelling, are altered in essential hypertension. 
      The second aim of the study was to assess whether chronic antihypertensive
      treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine would normalize these
      alterations. To test this hypothesis, we measured plasma concentrations of active
      MMP-2 and MMP-9 in 42 patients with never-treated essential hypertension and in
      25 normotensive control subjects. Measurements were repeated after 6 months of
      treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Baseline values of MMP-2
      and MMP-9 were decreased (P=0.01 and 0.002, respectively) in hypertensive
      patients compared with normotensives. Hypertensive patients with systemic
      vascular resistances <1440 dyn s/cm(5) exhibited higher values of MMP-2 (P=0.005)
      and MMP-9 (P=0.001) than hypertensive patients with systemic vascular resistances
      >1440 dyn s/cm(5). Treated patients attained a nonsignificant increase in MMP-2
      plasma concentrations, but a significant increase in MMP-9 plasma concentrations 
      (P=0.01) compared to respective values before treatment. In conclusion, these
      findings suggest that plasma concentrations of active MMP-2 and MMP-9, mainly
      related to vascular extracellular matrix metabolism, are depressed in patients
      with essential hypertension. A 6 month treatment with amlodipine can normalize
      MMP-9 but not MMP-2 plasma concentrations. The hypothesis that antihypertensive
      treatment may modulate collagen metabolism remains to be determined by further
      studies.

      advanced malignant melanoma.
PG  - 87-91
AB  - Treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma with either dacarbazine (DTIC) or 
      interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) as single drugs, or in combination, results in a
      response rate of approximately 15-20%. This study evaluated the activity and
      toxicity following treatment with a combination of DTIC, IFNalpha2b and verapamil
      (VPL). Thirty patients with disseminated metastatic melanoma received DTIC 250
      mg/m(2) on days 1-5 of a 4 week schedule, IFNalpha2b 3 MIU on days 1-5 each week,
      and VPL 80 mg three times a day throughout the cycle, until either disease
      progression or serious toxicity was observed. Among the 28 evaluable patients,
      there were four complete responses (CRs), five partial responses (PRs) and eight 
      patients with stable disease (SD). The overall response rate (CR + PR) was 32%.
      Two patients with a CR were long-term survivors (45 and 34 months) and a third is
      still in complete remission after 49 months. The fourth CR patient relapsed and
      died with progressive brain metastases after 8 months. Among the eight patients
      with SD, one survived for 22 months and another for 34 months. Despite one toxic 
      death, these results suggest that this treatment regimen is well tolerated and
      seems to be more effective than DTIC alone in a subset of patients. A controlled 
      randomized study would be required to determine the value of adding VPL and
      IFNalpha2b to DTIC.

TI  - Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor on renal function in patients 
      of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with mild to moderate renal
      insufficiency.
PG  - 1245-9
AB  - AIM: To determine the effect of enalapril, angiotensin-converting-enzyme
      inhibitor (ACE-I) on progression of renal insufficiency in primary
      membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with mild to moderate renal
      insufficiency. METHOD: Thirty patients with histopathologically proved MPGN
      having hypertension (grade I and II of JNC-VI criteria of hypertension) and mild 
      to moderate impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance varying from 30-80
      ml/min, significant albuminuria and serum creatinine 1.2-3.0 mg/dl) were
      initially treated with diuretics and 3-blockers to bring down BP < 140/90 mm Hg. 
      These patients were then randomly divided into three groups of 10 each, group
      I--Control; group II--Nifedipine and group III--Enalapril. In group II and III
      Nifidepine 30 mg/day and in group III Enalapril 10 mg/day respectively were added
      in addition and treatment was continued for nine months. These patients were
      followed up monthly for drug efficacy, side effects and any adverse drug
      reaction. RESULTS: Out of 30, 28 patients completed the study. At the end of nine
      months of treatment the patients of control group revealed significant increase
      in serum creatinine (1.65 +/- 0.38 to 2.17 +/- 0.31 mg/dl), blood urea (34.0 +/- 
      3.9 to 40.0 +/- 3.1 mg/dl), and 24 hours albuminuria (3.6 +/- 0.6 to 4.2 +/- 0.6 
      gm) and decrease in creatinine clearance (60.3 +/- 13.3 to 37.5 +/- 11.8 m/min); 
      however, in enalapril group there was decrease in serum creatinine (1.72 +/- 0.45
      to 1.24 +/- 0.58 mg/dl), blood urea (34.6 +/- 4.7 to 28.1 +/- 6.7 mg/dl) and 24
      hours albuminuria (3.3 +/- 1.0 to 1.6 +/- 1.1 gm) and increase in creatinine
      clearance (56A +/- 15.8 to 77.1 +/- 23.5 ml/min). The patients on nifedipine
      showed statistically nonsignificant changes in creatinine clearance, blood urea
      and serum creatinine; while albuminuria increased from 3.0 +/- 1.3 to 3.9 +/- 0.4
      gm/24 hours (p < 0.01). The blood pressure was well controlled in all patients.
      None of the patient had side effects leading to withdrawal of drugs. No adverse
      drug reaction was noted. CONCLUSION: ACE-I (enalapril) provided protection
      against the progression of renal insufficiency in patients of MPGN having
      hypertension with mild to moderate renal impairment. The renoprotective effects
      of ACE inhibitor (enalapril) is associated with substantial decrease in
      albuminuria.

TI  - Amlodipine reduces blood pressure and headache frequency in cocaine-dependent
      outpatients.
PG  - 415-9
AB  - Blood pressure and headache frequency were evaluated in normotensive male and
      female cocaine-dependent patients (N=43) participating in a placebo-controlled,
      double-blind trial of amlodipine for the treatment of cocaine dependence.
      Amlodipine produced a significant reduction in both systolic (p=0.04) and
      diastolic (p=0.01) blood pressures without producing dizziness or faintness.
      Placebo subjects had about three times the frequency of headaches compared to the
      amlodipine-treated subjects (p=0.004). The high frequency of headaches reported
      by cocaine-dependent individuals was significantly reduced by amlodipine and may 
      reflect improved cerebrovascular tone.

TI  - Effect of nifedipine and cerivastatin on coronary endothelial function in
      patients with coronary artery disease: the ENCORE I Study (Evaluation of
      Nifedipine and Cerivastatin On Recovery of coronary Endothelial function).
PG  - 422-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is an important feature of atherosclerosis.
      Inhibition of the HMG-CoA pathway and of calcium channels improves endothelial
      function experimentally and in the forearm circulation. Thus, we investigated the
      effects of a statin and/or a calcium antagonist on coronary endothelial function 
      in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS AND RESULTS: In 343
      patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in 29 centers,
      acetylcholine (10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/L) was infused in a coronary segment without 
      angiographically significant CAD. Changes in coronary diameter were measured by
      quantitative angiography. Endothelium-independent responses were assessed by
      intracoronary adenosine (1.2 mg/mL) and nitroglycerin (250 microg). Thereafter,
      patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to placebo, cerivastatin 0.4
      mg/d, nifedipine 30 to 60 mg/d, or their combination. Studies were repeated at 6 
      months. In the most constricted segment, nifedipine but not cerivastatin reduced 
      vasoconstriction to acetylcholine (18.8% versus placebo 10.0%; P<0.05). Patients 
      not taking ACE inhibitors showed a smaller improvement in the placebo group
      (6.0%), but nifedipine still had an effect (17.0%; P<0.05 versus placebo).
      Analysis of all evaluable coronary segments revealed an 11% reduction of
      acetylcholine-induced vasoconstriction in patients receiving nifedipine and
      cerivastatin (P<0.05 versus placebo). Cerivastatin lowered LDL cholesterol by 35%
      (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The ENCORE I trial demonstrates that multicenter studies 
      on coronary endothelial function are feasible. After 6 months' treatment,
      nifedipine improved coronary endothelial function in the most constricted
      segment. The combination of nifedipine and cerivastatin tended to improve
      endothelial function; however, this only reached significance in an analysis of
      all coronary segments.

TI  - Comparison of home and office blood pressure in treated hypertensives in the
      Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study.
PG  - 371-6
AB  - The aim of the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study was to compare cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality in calcium-antagonist-based treatment with diltiazem and 
      conventional diuretic/beta-blocker-based treatment in essential hypertension. The
      objective of the present sub-study was to compare self-measured home blood
      pressure with office blood pressure at a time-point in the study when the
      patients' blood pressures had been treated to the level that the investigators
      conceived to be the blood pressure target. The NORDIL study was prospective,
      randomized, open and endpoint-blinded. It enrolled 10881 patients aged 50-74
      years at health centers in Norway and Sweden who had diastolic blood pressure
      (BP) of 100 mmHg or more. The present sub-study group (n = 87) was small but
      fairly representative for the entire study population regarding baseline
      characteristics. Both systolic (4.0 mmHg, p = 0.01) and diastolic blood pressures
      (3.1 mmHg, p < 0.001) were significantly lower at home than in the office.
      Pearson correlation coefficients between the respective office and home readings 
      were statistically highly significant (p < 0.001), but of moderate strength
      ranging from r = 0.41 for heart rate to r = 0.46 and r = 0.58 for diastolic and
      systolic blood pressures, respectively. Altman plots also gave statistical
      support to some inconsistency between the two methods of measurements. Pearson
      correlation coefficients between afternoon and morning measurements showed strong
      relationships with r-values >0.9 for both blood pressures and heart rate. The
      Altman plots also suggested excellent consistency between afternoon and morning
      measurements. Thus, motivated and trained hypertensive patients can perform home 
      recordings of blood pressure and heart rate with precision; however, there are
      differences between recordings at home and in the investigators' offices that
      suggest some degree of "white coat effect" in these treated hypertensives.

      ventricular mass and sympathetic activity: Nifedipine-GITS versus felodipine-ER
      versus enalapril.
PG  - 1285-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent meta-analyses suggest that once-daily dihydropyridines and
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors cause similar decreases in left
      ventricular (LV) mass for comparable decreases in blood pressure (BP). However,
      some dihydropyridines, such as felodipine-extended release (ER), still increase
      sympathetic activity and may, therefore, be less effective in decreasing LV mass.
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of long term antihypertensive treatment with 
      nifedipine-gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) and felodipine-ER compared 
      with enalapril on LV mass relative to the extent of BP control (assessed by 24 h 
      ambulatory BP monitoring) and sympathetic activity (assessed by plasma
      catecholamine concentrations). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Enalapril was started at 10 
      mg/day, felodipine-ER at 5 mg/day and nifedipine-GITS at 30 mg/day, all once
      daily. Doses were increased to 20 mg/day, 10 mg/day or 60 mg/day, respectively,
      if the office BP remained 160/90 mmHg or greater at the end of the dosing
      interval. Evaluable echocardiograms were obtained for 116 patients at the end of 
      the study (30 weeks of treatment). RESULTS: On 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring,
      nifedipine-GITS caused a consistent decrease in BP throughout the 24 h dosing
      interval, whereas felodipine-ER caused a more marked fall in BP during the day,
      and enalapril's effects diminished during the night and had disappeared by the
      morning. Only felodipine-ER significantly increased supine and standing plasma
      noradrenaline by more than 50% similarly after six, 18, and 30 weeks of
      treatment. In BP responders (decrease in systolic BP 10 mmHg or greater),
      enalapril and nifedipine-GITS caused clear decreases in LV mass by 12 to 16 g/m2,
      whereas felodipine-ER was less effective (decrease by only 6 g/m2, P<0.01 versus 
      enalapril). CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily dihydropyridines should not be regarded as
      one homogeneous class and, compared with felodipine-ER, nifedipine-GITS exhibits 
      a better profile regarding 24 h BP control, sympathetic activation and regression
      of LV mass.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of a once daily graded-release diltiazem formulation in
      essential hypertension.
PG  - 51-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of a chronotherapeutic, graded-release
      diltiazem HCl extended-release (GRD) 120-, 240-, 360- and 540-mg dose
      administered once-daily at bedtime (10 PM) were evaluated in a 7-week randomized,
      double-blind comparison to placebo and to GRD 360 mg administered once-daily at 8
      AM in 478 patients with moderate-to-severe essential hypertension. METHODS: We
      assessed the change from baseline to end point in trough diastolic blood pressure
      (DBP) at 6 PM to 10 PM and in mean DBP from 6 AM to 12 noon between GRD 360 mg PM
      and GRD 360 mg AM, measured by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). RESULTS: Bedtime 
      doses of GRD showed dose-related mean reductions in trough DBP that were
      significant for GRD doses of 240 mg and higher. Bedtime GRD 360 mg was associated
      with a significantly greater reduction in mean DBP between 6 AM and 12 noon
      compared to morning GRD 360 mg with a least squares mean for treatment difference
      of -3.3 mm Hg (P =.0004). Similar dose-related and significant reductions in
      systolic BP (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were obtained. Incidence of adverse events 
      (AEs) for all GRD groups (44.5%) was less than that obtained for the placebo
      group (49.3%). The 540-mg group showed an incidence of AEs (43.5%) similar to
      that observed for the 240-mg group (42.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The GRD dose-dependently
      significantly reduces BP and HR over the 24-h interval after once-daily bedtime
      dosing. Further greater reductions were obtained between 6 AM and 12 noon, when
      circadian BP is highest, compared to morning administration of the same dose. The
      540-mg GRD was safe, well tolerated, and offers further therapeutic option for
      patients with severe hypertension who required additional BP control.

TI  - Blood pressure response to antihypertensive agents related to baseline blood
      pressure.
PG  - 1113-20
AB  - Prevalence of white-coat hypertension varies approximately 20 per cent among mild
      hypertensives. When white-coat hypertensives are prescribed antihypertensive
      medication, there is usually a decrease in clinic blood pressure (BP), but little
      or no change in 24 hours blood pressure (ABPM). The objective of the study was to
      test the hypothesis that efficacy of medication therapy for hypertension is
      identical in any grading of severity of baseline blood pressure. The authors
      retrospectively analysed ABPM data from mild to moderate hypertensive patients.
      Efficacy in decreasing blood pressure by antihypertensives has linear relation to
      baseline blood pressure. Response to antihypertensive agents in white-coat
      hypertension is minimal but a significant effect still persists and the
      possibility of hypotensive adverse events from medication in the case cannot be
      overlooked.

TI  - Strategy for the treatment of noncompliant hypertensive hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1061-5
AB  - Hypertensive hemodialysis patients noncompliant for their medications do not
      benefit from pharmacologic advances in the treatment of high blood pressure, and 
      increase their already high risk of cardiovascular complications. The medical
      staff often becomes frustrated by severe hypertension in those who refuse to take
      medicines at home, drink excessive fluids, miss multiple dialysis sessions and
      sign-off dialysis early. In addition to addressing the psychosocial, financial,
      educational and substance abuse problems which contribute to noncompliance, we
      have developed a medication strategy to serve as an at least interim means of
      lowering blood pressure. Antihypertensive agents which have long half-lives in
      renal failure (lisinopril) and/or are intrinsically long acting (transdermal
      clonidine and amlodipine) were administered on dialysis days by the unit
      personnel to those patients who did not or would not take that or any dose on
      their own. The lisinopril and amlodipine were assured to have been taken on at
      least the dialysis days (thrice weekly), and the clonidine patch replaced weekly.
      Sixteen patients were thus treated when they failed to reliably self-administer
      medications. They had a significant decline in the predialysis systolic pressure 
      of 15 mm Hg (175 +/- 6 to 160 +/- 5 mm Hg), diastolic of 12 mm Hg (103 +/- 3 to
      91 +/- 3 mm Hg), and mean pressure of 13 mm Hg (127 +/- 4 to 114 +/- 4 mm Hg).
      There was an improvement in post-dialysis bood pressures, with the mean pressure 
      declining 13 mm Hg from 110 +/- 4 to 97 +/- 4 mm Hg. Many individuals had erratic
      blood pressure control, having intermittently missed dialysis and hence
      unit-administered medicine, as well as continued fluid or drug abuse. The
      patients had uniformly excellent acceptance of this regimen, even spontaneously
      requesting it, and had no appreciable adverse effects. In summary while
      noncompliance is being addressed by the entire medical team, dialysis unit
      administration of long-acting medicines helps many hypertensive dialysis patients
      who would otherwise be at increased risk for severe cardiovascular complications.

TI  - Dynamic and kinetic disposition of nisoldipine enantiomers in hypertensive
      patients presenting with type-2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 607-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nisoldipine (N) is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist marketed as a 
      racemic mixture and used for the treatment of hypertension. In the present study,
      we investigated the influence of type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM) on the
      enantioselective pharmacokinetic and dynamic parameters of N. METHODS: Seventeen 
      hypertensive patients, nine of them with DM, were investigated in a cross-over
      study with administration of rac-N as coat-core tablets (20 mg day(-1)) or
      placebo for 15 days each. Serial blood samples (0-24 h) were collected on the
      15th day, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was simultaneously
      evaluated. N enantiomers in plasma samples were analysed using chiral
      high-performance liquid chromatography combined with gas chromatography/mass
      spectrometry. The enantiomeric ratios differing from one were evaluated using the
      Wilcoxon test, and the results are reported as means with the 95% confidence
      intervals. A lidocaine (L) test was carried out as an in vivo marker of CYP3A4
      (and CYP1A2) activities. RESULTS: The following differences were observed between
      the (+)-N and (-)-N enantiomers, respectively, in the patients presenting with DM
      (means and ranges): C(max) 3.9 (1.7-6.1) ng ml(-1) versus 0.7 (0.4-1.0) ng
      ml(-1), AUC(0-24) 51.5 (29.0-74.0) ng ml(-1) h versus 9.4 (5.9-12.8) ng ml(-1) h,
      and Cl/f 3.6 (1.9-5.4) l h(-1) kg(-1) versus 18.7 (11.7-25.7) l h(-1) kg(-1). The
      Cl/f value of (+)-N was lower (Mann-Whitney test) in patients with DM: 6.0
      (4.3-7.5) l h(-1) kg(-1) versus 3.6 (1.9-5.4) l h(-1) kg(-1). The same
      observation was made for the (-)-N, with Cl/f reaching 38.8 (26.8-51.0) l h(-1)
      kg(-1) and 18.7 (11.7-25.7) l h(-1) kg(-1) for the non-diabetic and DM groups,
      respectively. The L test resulted in higher ratios (P < 0.05) of plasma L/MEGX
      concentrations (30 min after i.v. L) for DM (11.1 vs 18.6). N significantly
      reduced systolic and diastolic BP (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test) in all patients
      investigated relative to placebo. No differences in BP reduction were observed
      between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. N significantly increased
      noradrenaline concentrations in plasma of both patient groups. The data also
      demonstrated that the plasma concentrations of noradrenaline 30 min after N
      administration were lower (P < 0.05) in diabetic (mean 2.86 pmol ml(-1)) than in 
      non-diabetic patients (4.80 pmol ml(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: The present data permit us
      to infer that type-2 diabetes mellitus alters the kinetic disposition of the
      (+)-N eutomer and (-)-N distomer, presumably due to a lower activity of CYP3A4,
      although it does not modify the clinical effect brought about by the reduction in
      BP.

TI  - Effects of four antihypertensive monotherapies on cardiac mass and function in
      hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: randomized prospective
      study.
PG  - 672-9
AB  - AIM: To compare the effects of four antihypertensive drugs, which have reportedly
      different effectiveness in reducing myocardial mass. METHODS: A randomized,
      double-blind, prospective study included 80 hypertensive patients with left
      ventricular (LV) hypertrophy confirmed both electrocardiographically and
      echocardiographically. We investigated the effects of indapamide, nicardipine,
      propranolol, and chlorthalidone on arterial blood pressure and LV mass and
      function. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (34 men and 30 women) completed the
      6-month study. No significant differences in antihypertensive effects of the four
      medications were found. The average decrease in systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure was 12.8% and 10.4%, respectively. All four antihypertensive medications
      caused pronounced reduction in LV mass, between 7.9% in the propranolol group and
      10.1% in the nicardipine group, with no significant difference between the
      groups. In patients receiving diuretics, predominant decrease was observed in LV 
      mass and LV mass index. In patients treated with propranolol, the thickness of
      both the LV wall and interventricular septum was reduced, whereas the reduction
      in LV mass, LV wall and interventricular septum thickness was found in patients
      treated with nicardipine. There was no significant correlation between the
      changes in LV mass and other variables (blood pressure, and systolic and
      diastolic function). Systolic function did not improve with the reversion of LV
      hypertrophy in any group of patients, but improvement was observed in some
      indices of diastolic function. The early and late LV filling velocity and their
      ratio did not improve significantly, either. Clinically relevant side effects
      were not observed. CONCLUSION: All four antihypertensive monotherapies achieved a
      comparable control of hypertension and reduction in LV hypertrophy.

TI  - Management of patients with hypertensive urgencies and emergencies: a systematic 
      review of the literature.
PG  - 937-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies are common clinical
      occurrences in hypertensive patients. Treatment practices vary considerably to
      because of the lack of evidence supporting the use of one therapeutic agent over 
      another. This paper was designed to review the evidence for various
      pharmacotherapeutic regimens in the management of hypertensive urgencies and
      emergencies, in terms of the agents' abilities to reach predetermined "safe" goal
      blood pressures (BPs), and to prevent adverse events. METHODS: medline was
      searched from 1966 to 2001, and the reference lists of all the articles were
      retrieved and searched for relevant references, and experts in the field were
      contacted to identify other relevant studies. The Cochrane Library was also
      searched. Studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review were systematic
      reviews of randomized control trials (RCTs) and individual RCTs, all-or-none
      studies, systematic reviews of cohort studies and individual cohort studies, and 
      outcomes research. No language restrictions were used. RESULTS: None of the
      trials included in this review identified an optimal rate of BP lowering in
      hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. The definitions of hypertensive
      emergencies and urgencies were not consistent, but emergencies always involved
      target end-organ damage, and urgencies were without such damage. Measures of
      outcome were not uniform between studies. The 4 hypertensive emergency and 15
      hypertensive urgency studies represented 236 and 1,074 patients, respectively.
      The evidence indicated a nonsignificant trend toward increased efficacy with
      urapidil compared to nitroprusside for hypertensive emergencies (number needed to
      treat [NNT] for urapidil to achieve target BP, 12; 95% confidence interval [95%
      CI], number of patients needed to harm [NNH], 5 to NNT, 40 compared to
      nitroprusside). Several medications were efficacious in treating hypertensive
      urgencies, including: nicardipine (NNT for nicardipine compared to plabebo, 2 in 
      one study [95% CI, 1 to 5] and 1 in another [95% CI, 1 to 1]); lacidipine (NNT,
      2; 95% CI, 1 to 8 for lacidipine vs nifedipine) or urapidil (NNT for urapidil
      compared to enalaprilat and nifedipine, 4; 95% CI, 3 to 6); and nitroprusside and
      fenoldopam (all patients reached target BP in 2 studies). The studies reported 2 
      cases of cerebral ischemia secondary to nifedipine. CONCLUSIONS: Many effective
      agents exist for the treatment of hypertensive crises. Because of the lack of
      large randomized controlled trials, many questions remain unanswered, such as
      follow-up times and whether any of the studied agents have mortality benefit.

TI  - Drug effects on aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio in primary aldosteronism.
PG  - 897-902
AB  - Primary aldosteronism is a specifically treatable and potentially curable form of
      secondary hypertension. The aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio (ARR) is
      routinely used as a screening test. Antihypertensive therapy can interfere with
      the interpretation of this parameter, but a correct washout period can be
      potentially harmful. We have investigated the effects of therapy with atenolol,
      amlodipine, doxazosin, fosinopril, and irbesartan on the ARR in a group of 230
      patients with suspected primary aldosteronism. The percent change from control of
      ARR in patients taking amlodipine was -17%+/-32; atenolol, 62%+/-82; doxazosin,
      -5%+/-26; fosinopril, -30%+/-24; and irbesartan, -43%+/-27. The ARR change
      induced by atenolol was significantly higher compared with that induced by all
      other drugs (P<0.0001), and the ARR change induced by irbesartan was
      significantly lower than that induced by doxazosin (P<0.0001). One of 55 patients
      from the group taking amlodipine (1.8%) and 4/17 of the patients taking
      irbesartan (23.5%) gave a false-negative ARR (<50). None of the patients of the
      groups taking fosinopril, doxazosin, and atenolol displayed a false-negative ARR.
      Doxazosin and fosinopril can be used in hypertensive patients who need to undergo
      aldosterone and PRA measurement for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism;
      amlodipine gave a very small percentage of false-negative diagnoses.
      beta-Blockers also do not interfere with the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, 
      but they can be responsible for an increased rate of false-positive ARRs. The
      high rate of false-negative diagnoses in patients undergoing irbesartan treatment
      requires confirmation in a higher number of patients.

TI  - Persistence of the antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine and nifedipine GITS
      after two 'missed doses': a randomised, double-blind comparative trial in Asian
      patients.
PG  - 805-13
AB  - Suboptimal management of hypertension is often a result of poor patient
      compliance in the form of missed doses of their antihypertensive medication. This
      multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial was designed to
      compare the persistence of the antihypertensive efficacy of the amlodipine and
      nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) after two 'missed doses',
      and also to compare the drugs' overall efficacy and safety in Asian patients with
      mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Following a 2-week placebo run-in
      period, 222 patients were randomised to receive either amlodipine (5 mg daily,
      increased after 6 weeks if necessary to 10 mg daily, n=109) or nifedipine GITS
      (30 mg daily, increased after 6 weeks if necessary to 60 mg daily; n=113) for 12 
      weeks. A placebo was then substituted for further 2 days with continuous
      ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The increases in the last 9 h of mean 
      ambulatory BP on day 2 after treatment withdrawal were significantly less with
      amlodipine than with nifedipine GITS: 4.4+/-7.0 vs 11.2+/-11.3 mmHg for systolic 
      BP (P<or=0.0001) and 2.4+/-6.3 vs 6.0+/-6.0 mmHg for diastolic BP (P<or=0.0002). 
      Significant differences between the two drugs in mean 24-h ambulatory BP levels
      were already evident on day 1 after withdrawal, even though there were no
      significant differences on the final day of treatment. No differences in safety
      parameters were observed, and neither drug caused any serious or severe
      treatment-related adverse events. In conclusion, amlodipine provides greater
      protection than nifedipine GITS against loss of BP control following missed
      doses.

TI  - Improvement of insulin sensitivity by a long-acting nifedipine preparation
      (nifedipine-CR) in patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 927-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nifedipine has been reported to cause impairment of insulin
      sensitivity. But recently a controlled-released formulation of nifedipine
      (nifedipine-GITS) has been reported that it could improve insulin sensitivity.
      METHODS: We evaluated insulin sensitivity in two groups of essential hypertensive
      subjects before and after treatment with either long-acting nifedipine
      (nifedipine-CR, Adalat CR tablets; Bayer Yakuhin, Osaka, Japan) (n = 10) or
      metoprolol (n = 9). Insulin sensitivity was evaluated from the steady-state
      plasma glucose (SSPG) level measured at the steady-state insulin level (20 to 30 
      microU/mL) using a modification of the SSPG method previously reported. RESULTS: 
      The SSPG was initially high, but was significantly reduced by nifedipine-CR
      treatment (from 133 +/- 14 mg/dL to 95 +/- 8 mg/dL). However, SSPG was not
      significantly altered by treatment in the metoprolol group (from 103 +/- 15 mg/dL
      to 119 +/- 12 mg/dL). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the long-acting
      nifedipine (nifedipine-CR) is associated with improved insulin sensitivity.

TI  - Myocardial sympathetic denervation, fatty acid metabolism, and left ventricular
      wall motion in vasospastic angina.
PG  - 1476-81
AB  - Although various noninvasive methods have been used to detect vasospasm, none of 
      them are sensitive enough for patients with sporadic attacks. Because abnormal
      fatty acid metabolism and cardiac adrenergic neuronal damage are observed in
      ischemic myocardium, (123)I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-R,S-methyl pentadecanoic acid
      (BMIPP) and (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) have recently been proposed as 
      useful tracers for detection of myocardial damage. This study investigated the
      relationships among the coronary vasospastic regions, abnormal left ventricular
      regional wall motion, fatty acid metabolism, and sympathetic nerve functions and 
      their changes during treatment in patients with vasospastic angina. METHODS: We
      evaluated 50 patients with vasospastic angina (25 with clinically documented
      vasospasm [group A] and 25 with vasospasm induced by ergonovine provocation
      [group B]) and 25 control subjects who had chest pain but had normal coronary
      arteries without ergonovine provocation of spasm. Sixteen patients in group A
      were reevaluated 6 mo after medical treatment. The territorial regions of the
      vasospasm-induced coronary artery, wall motion determined by left
      ventriculography, and BMIPP and MIBG uptake were compared. RESULTS: Regions
      exhibiting a positive reaction to the ergonovine provocation were observed in the
      right coronary artery in 41 patients, the left anterior descending artery in 33, 
      and the left circumflex artery in 21. Provocation occurred in multiple vessels in
      29 patients (58%). Reduction of wall motion was observed in 19 patients (38%).
      Sensitivity and specificity for the identification of vasospastic angina were 86%
      (43/50 patients) and 88% (22/25 control subjects), respectively, for BMIPP
      scintigraphy and 100% (50/50 patients) and 56% (14/25 control subjects),
      respectively, for MIBG scintigraphy. In the region exhibiting a reduction in left
      ventricular wall motion, BMIPP or MIBG uptake was decreased. The sensitivity and 
      specificity of determination of vasospasm-induced coronary arteries were 71%
      (67/95 arteries) and 95% (71/75 arteries), respectively, for BMIPP scintigraphy
      and 96% (91/95 arteries) and 55% (41/75 arteries), respectively, for MIBG
      scintigraphy. After 6 mo, during treatment, vasospasm was reinduced by ergonovine
      provocation in 6 patients (group I) and was not reinduced in 10 patients (group
      II). Improvements of decreased BMIPP and MIBG uptake were lower in group I (25%
      +/- 4% and 16% +/- 4%, respectively) than in group II (69% +/- 4% and 50% +/- 3%,
      respectively; both P < 0.01). The regions in which vasospasm was reinduced
      exhibited decreased BMIPP and MIBG uptake. CONCLUSION: Abnormal fatty acid
      metabolism and cardiac sympathetic denervation were observed more frequently than
      were wall motion abnormalities in the vasospastic region in patients with
      vasospastic angina. BMIPP and MIBG scintigraphy are highly accurate and
      noninvasive techniques for determining the presence and location of vasospasm.

TI  - Gastrointestinal safety of an extended-release, nondeformable, oral dosage form
      (OROS: a retrospective study.
PG  - 1021-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: The OROS osmotic (OSM) dosage form optimises extended-release oral
      administration by controlling the rate of drug release for a predetermined time, 
      providing constant, patterned, or pulsed delivery profiles. OSM products include 
      prescription medications for urology, CNS, and cardiovascular indications, as
      well as over-the-counter nasal/sinus congestion medications. METHODS: This
      retrospective study examines US gastrointestinal (GI) safety data for the OROS
      dosage form following nearly two decades of use. Although GI injury and
      obstruction are known effects of oral medications, some reports have suggested
      that extended-release products pose a greater risk of GI injury and obstruction
      than other oral dosage forms. Products incorporating OROS technology are being
      prescribed to an expanding range of patients; a review of the GI safety data for 
      this dosage form thus seemed timely and appropriate. US safety information was
      obtained from three sources: English language literature published from 1982
      until June 1, 2000 from five major biomedical databases;postmarketing safety
      reports from January 1, 1983 until June 1, 2000 available through the Freedom of 
      Information Act; andcommercial safety information obtained directly from ALZA
      Corporation's in-house safety database for those OSM products for which ALZA has 
      reporting responsibility. US distribution data from IMS National Prescription
      Audit trade mark Plus data were used to estimate cumulative product distribution 
      totals. These totals were combined with numbers of unique GI events to determine 
      the estimated frequency of events. RESULTS: Nearly 13 billion OSM tablets are
      estimated to have been distributed in the US. The incidence of all clinically
      significant GI adverse events for OSM products (including intestinal, gastric,
      and oesophageal irritation, injury, and obstruction) reported in the US was
      approximately one case in >76 million tablets distributed. The majority (78%;
      estimated incidence: one case in 29 million tablets) of cases were reported in
      patients taking Procardia XL (nifedipine). Oesophageal and lower GI obstruction
      were reported primarily in patients with pre-existing abnormalities or disease of
      the GI tract. Among paediatric patients, one obstruction was reported in an
      estimated 37.7 million tablets distributed. Reports of GI irritation associated
      with OSM products were consistent with known effects of the same drug substances 
      in other dosage forms. CONCLUSION: A review of long-term safety experience with
      products using OSM controlled-release technology yields a low incidence of
      clinically significant GI events. Properly prescribed, extended-release products 
      provide substantial therapeutic and convenience benefits without additional risk.

TI  - Amlodipine versus Angiotensin-receptor blockers for nonhypertension indications.
PG  - 1759-66
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy and safety data of amlodipine and the
      angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), focusing on heart failure, angina,
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and renal protection. DATA SOURCE: A
      MEDLINE search (1966-December 2001) was completed using amlodipine,
      angiotensin-receptor antagonist, losartan, valsartan, candesartan, and
      telmisartan as key words. English-language articles were identified and included.
      STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All identified articles were evaluated.
      Articles representative of the subject matter of our review were included. DATA
      SYNTHESIS: Amlodipine and the ARBs lower blood pressure to a similar extent.
      Amlodipine is an effective antianginal agent, whereas ARBs are not. However,
      amlodipine is not effective in the treatment of heart failure; ARBs may be useful
      in this setting. ARBs are also effective in preserving renal function and may
      provide some protection from restenosis in patients who have had a PCI. The ARBs 
      may also be useful in preventing both diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant disease states should be considered when choosing
      between an ARB and amlodipine for the management of hypertension.

TI  - [Coagulative and fibrinolytic changes in patients with essential hypertension and
      the effect of sustained-release nifedipine].
PG  - 168-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of coagulation and fibrinolysis status in
      patients with essential hypertension (EH) and observe the therapeutic effect of
      sustained-release nifedipine. METHODS: Ninety-nine EH patients were divided
      according to their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) into mild group (48 cases),
      moderate group (29 cases) and severe group (22 cases), and 25 patients among the 
      groups were chosen at random to receive sustained-release nifedipine for 2 weeks.
      Twenty healthy subjects served as control group. Plasma D-dimer (DD), fibrin
      monomer (FM) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) levels were determined
      in all the subjects by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The
      plasma DD and FM levels were much higher, while tPA level was much lower in
      hypertensives than those of normal controls, exacerbating with the severity of
      the disease. DBP was positively correlated with plasma FM level
      (r=0.374,P<0.001). In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, left
      ventricular enlargement and left atrial enlargement, higher levels of DD, FM and 
      tPA were detected. Nifedipine treatment produced significant reduction in plasma 
      DD and FM levels along with the increase in tPA level [DD: (40.7+/-23.5) mg/dl vs
      (23.8+/-16.5) mg/dl; FM: (7.0+/-1.6) ng/microliter vs (4.8+/-1.5) ng/microliter
      tPA: (0.31+/-0.14) ng/ml vs(0.41+/-0.05) ng/ml, P<0.001]. CONCLUSION: Enhanced
      coagulative activity and lowered fibrinolytic activity characterize EH patients
      and nifedipine may correct this disorder.

TI  - The prevention of dementia with antihypertensive treatment: new evidence from the
      Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) study.
PG  - 2046-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: After the double-blind, placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in
      Europe (Syst-Eur) trial ended in February 1997, randomized patients were offered 
      active study medication for a further period of observation. OBJECTIVE: To refine
      the estimates of the long-term effects of antihypertensive therapy on the
      incidence of dementia. METHODS: Eligible patients had no dementia and were at
      least 60 years old. Their systolic blood pressure at entry was 160 to 219 mm Hg, 
      with diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg. Antihypertensive therapy was
      started immediately after randomization in the active treatment group, but only
      after termination of the double-blind trial in the control patients. Treatment
      consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/d), with the possible addition of enalapril
      maleate (5-20 mg/d), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/d), or both add-on drugs.
      RESULTS: Median follow-up increased from 2.0 years in the double-blind trial to
      3.9 years overall. The incidence of dementia doubled from 32 to 64 cases, 41 of
      whom had Alzheimer disease. Throughout follow-up, systolic/diastolic blood
      pressure was 7.0/3.2 mm Hg higher in the 1417 control patients than in the 1485
      subjects randomized to active treatment. At the last examination, the blood
      pressure difference was still 4.2/2.9 mm Hg; 48.1%, 26.4%, and 11.4% of the
      control patients were taking nitrendipine, enalapril, and/or hydrochlorothiazide,
      whereas in the active treatment group these proportions were 70.2%, 35.4%, and
      18.4%, respectively. Compared with the controls, long-term antihypertensive
      therapy reduced the risk of dementia by 55%, from 7.4 to 3.3 cases per 1000
      patient-years (43 vs 21 cases, P<.001). After adjustment for sex, age, education,
      and entry blood pressure, the relative hazard rate associated with the use of
      nitrendipine was 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.64; P<.001). Treatment of 
      1000 patients for 5 years can prevent 20 cases of dementia (95% confidence
      interval, 7-33). CONCLUSION: The extended follow-up of Syst-Eur patients
      reinforces the evidence that blood pressure-lowering therapy initiated with a
      long-acting dihydropyridine protects against dementia in older patients with
      systolic hypertension.

TI  - Medical treatment of myocardial ischemia in coronary artery disease: effect of
      drug regime and irregular dosing in the CAPE II trial.
PG  - 917-25
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Circadian Anti-ischemia Program in Europe (CAPE II) compared the 
      efficacy of amlodipine and diltiazem (Adizem XL) and the combination of
      amlodipine/atenolol and diltiazem (Adizem XL)/isosorbide 5-mononitrate on
      exercise and ambulatory myocardial ischemia during regular therapy and after
      omission of medication. BACKGROUND: The optimal medical therapy for ischemia
      suppression and the impact of irregular dosing using agents with different
      pharmacologic properties has not been established in patients with coronary
      disease. METHODS: Patients with > or = 4 ischemic episodes or > or = 20 min of ST
      segment depression on 72-h electrocardiogram were randomized to amlodipine 10 mg 
      once daily or diltiazem (Adizem XL) 300 mg once daily in a 14-week double-blind
      randomized multicountry study. In the second phase, atenolol 100 mg was added to 
      amlodipine and isosorbide 5-mononitrate 100 mg to diltiazem (Adizem XL).
      Ambulatory monitoring (72 h) and exercise testing were repeated after both
      phases, on treatment and after a 24-h drug-free interval. RESULTS: Both
      monotherapy with amlodipine and diltiazem (Adizem XL) were effective on symptoms 
      and ambulatory and exercise ischemia. Combination therapy reduced ischemia
      further, with amlodipine/atenolol superior to diltiazem (Adizem XL)/isosorbide
      5-mononitrate. Amlodipine/atenolol was significantly superior during the
      drug-free interval with maintenance of ischemia reduction. CONCLUSIONS:
      Amlodipine, with its intrinsically long half-life alone or together with
      beta-blocker, is likely to produce superior ischemia reduction in clinical
      practice when patients frequently forget to take medication or dose irregularly.

TI  - Short-term treatment of severe hypertension of pregnancy: prospective comparison 
      of nicardipine and labetalol.
PG  - 1281-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of nicardipine in comparison to
      labetalol in the initial management of severe hypertension in pregnancy. DESIGN. 
      Randomized prospective study. SETTING: The obstetric ward of the teaching
      hospital of Monastir Tunisia. PATIENTS: Sixty consecutive pregnant women admitted
      beyond the 24th week of pregnancy with severe hypertension. INTERVENTION:
      Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenously for 1 h either labetalol
      ( n=30) or nicardipine ( n=30). Treatment was titrated to achieve a 20% lowering 
      of blood pressure (BP). MEASUREMENTS: Maternal BP and heart rate were measured at
      inclusion and repeatedly during the first hour following the drugs
      administration. Fetal heart rate was recorded throughout the study period. The
      main outcome endpoints were the success rate and the length of time needed to
      achieve the therapeutic goal. The rate of maternal and fetal adverse events and
      dose adjustments were also analyzed. RESULTS: Labetalol and nicardipine achieved 
      the 20% lowering in BP in the same proportion (63% and 70% success rates,
      respectively). Overall nicardipine caused a significantly greater decrease in
      systolic and diastolic BP. No patient had any episode of hypotension. The length 
      of time to achieve the BP goal was also similar (12 vs. 11 min, respectively).
      Both drugs were well tolerated except for a moderate tachycardia observed with
      the use of nicardipine. CONCLUSION: Nicardipine and labetalol are effective and
      safe in the initial treatment of severe hypertension of pregnancy.

TI  - Prognostic significance of renal function in elderly patients with isolated
      systolic hypertension: results from the Syst-Eur trial.
PG  - 2213-22
AB  - Several reports suggest that markers of renal function such as serum creatinine, 
      serum uric acid, and urinary excretion of protein may be related to
      cardiovascular complications and mortality. This study analyzed the data from the
      Syst-Eur trial, which was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
      intervention trial in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. The
      purpose was to evaluate whether serum levels of creatinine and uric acid and
      urinary protein excretion at entry are related to subsequent morbidity and
      mortality. Incidence rates of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke
      (fatal as well as nonfatal), coronary events, and all cardiovascular endpoints
      were calculated for each quintile of serum creatinine or serum uric acid or for
      each category of protein excretion (none, trace, and overt). Crude and adjusted
      relative hazard rates were also determined for each 20 micro M increase in serum 
      creatinine, each 50 micro M increase in serum uric acid, and for each protein
      excretion category. Even when adjusted for age, gender, and various other
      covariates, serum creatinine was significantly associated with a worse prognosis.
      There was an U-shaped relationship between serum uric acid and total mortality,
      but otherwise no obvious relationships were detected between serum uric acid
      levels and complications when appropriate adjustments were made for confounding
      variables. Proteinuria at entry was a significant predictor of total mortality
      and all cardiovascular endpoints. It is concluded that higher levels of serum
      creatinine and trace or overt proteinuria are associated with an increased number
      of cardiovascular events and with a higher mortality in patients with isolated
      systolic hypertension.

TI  - Smooth blood pressure control obtained with extended-release felodipine in
      elderly patients with hypertension: evaluation by 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring.
PG  - 541-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess, by smoothness index (SI), distribution of the
      antihypertensive effect of extended-release (ER) felodipine over 24 hours in
      elderly patients with hypertension. METHODS: After a 4-week washout phase, 35
      elderly patients (mean age 69 +/- 4 years) with mild-to-moderate hypertension
      received 2 weeks' treatment with ER felodipine 5mg once daily. The dosage of ER
      felodipine was doubled to 10 mg/day and given for a further 2 weeks in
      non-responders (sitting clinic blood pressure > 140/90mm Hg). The study had an
      open-label design with no placebo control. After each period, clinic and
      ambulatory blood pressures were measured. Trough-to-peak (T/P) ratio was computed
      by dividing the blood pressure (BP) change at trough (22 to 24 hours after drug
      intake) by the change at peak (2 adjacent hours with a maximal BP reduction
      between the second and eighth hour after drug intake). SI was calculated as the
      ratio between the average of the 24, hourly, treatment-induced BP changes and its
      standard deviation. RESULTS: After the initial 2-week treatment period, clinic
      and 24-hour ambulatory BP values were higher in non-responders (145 +/- 11/87 +/-
      8 and 135 +/- 17/80 +/- 6mm Hg, respectively) than in responders (133 +/- 6/81
      +/- 3 and 130 +/- 9/77 +/- 7mm Hg). In non-responders, clinic and 24-hour BP
      values were lowered after a further 2 weeks of treatment with ER felodipine 10
      mg/day (128 +/- 11/78 +/- 6 and 128 +/- 12/75 +/- 5mm Hg). SI was high in
      responders (0.8 +/- 0.8/0.7 +/- 0.7 for systolic/diastolic BP) and low in
      non-responders (0.5 +/- 0.6/0.3 +/- 0.6) during the first 2-week treatment
      period. It increased in non-responders after an additional 2 weeks of treatment
      with ER felodipine 10 mg/day (1.0 +/- 0.8/0.7 +/- 0.6). Median T/P ratios were
      0.73 and 0.61 (systolic BP and diastolic BP) in responders and 0.41 and 0.61 in
      non-responders after 2 weeks of treatment. At variance with SI, T/P ratios did
      not increase in non-responders after doubling the dosage of ER felodipine (0.34
      and 0.18). ER felodipine did not increase 24-hour heart rate. A total of nine
      adverse events were recorded in six patients (17%), but no patients withdrew from
      the study. CONCLUSION: ER felodipine 5 to 10 mg/day smoothly and safely reduces
      24-hour ambulatory BP in elderly patients with hypertension.

TI  - Effects of six anti-hypertensive medications on cognitive performance.
PG  - 1643-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare the effects of six different antihypertensive 
      medications on cognitive performance. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, and
      double-blind with treatment cross-over. SETTING: University hypertension clinic
      and neuropsychology laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-eight Caucasian men between 
      25 and 55 years of age with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (88 of whom
      completed the study), and 32 normotensive men with similar socio-demographic
      characteristics. INTERVENTIONS: Six-week treatment periods with atenolol,
      metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, methyldopa, enalapril and verapamil, and 2-week 
      placebo baseline and wash-out periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-depth
      neuropsychological assessments and several mood questionnaires were completed
      during placebo (baseline) periods and active treatment periods. Practice effects 
      due to repeated neuropsychological testing were estimated from data collected
      concurrently in the normotensive participants. RESULTS: The antihypertensive
      treatments lowered blood pressure comparably and did not affect mood or anxiety. 
      Small treatment effects were noted in four of seven domains of cognitive
      performance. Irrespective of medication type, treatment reduced the simple motor 
      speed (P < 0.001), and slowed completion of two tests measuring perceptuo-motor
      speed and mental flexibility (P </= 0.05). Manual dexterity declined somewhat
      with metoprolol and methyldopa (P = 0.01). In contrast, all antihypertensive
      agents favorably affected performance on several tests that require working
      memory (P < 0.01). Performance on other tests assessing grip strength, learning
      and memory, attention and executive function was not affected. CONCLUSION:
      Short-term treatment with standard antihypertensive medications was associated
      with some small decrements in psychomotor performance and small improvements in
      working memory, without notable drug-class differences. Long-term effects await
      further study.

TI  - Microalbuminuria reduction with valsartan in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus: a blood pressure-independent effect.
PG  - 672-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated urine albumin excretion (UAER) is a modifiable risk factor
      for renal and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. Blockade of the
      renin-angiotensin system lowers UAER, but whether this effect is independent of
      blood pressure (BP) reduction remains controversial. The MicroAlbuminuria
      Reduction With VALsartan (MARVAL) study was designed to evaluate the
      BP-independent effect of valsartan on UAER in type 2 diabetic patients with
      microalbuminuria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-two patients with
      type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, with or without hypertension, were randomly
      assigned to 80 mg/d valsartan or 5 mg/d amlodipine for 24 weeks. A target BP of
      135/85 mm Hg was aimed for by dose-doubling followed by addition of
      bendrofluazide and doxazosin whenever needed. The primary end point was the
      percent change in UAER from baseline to 24 weeks. The UAER at 24 weeks was 56%
      (95% CI, 49.6 to 63.0) of baseline with valsartan and 92% (95% CI, 81.7 to 103.7)
      of baseline with amlodipine, a highly significant between-group effect (P<0.001).
      Valsartan lowered UAER similarly in both the hypertensive and normotensive
      subgroups. More patients reversed to normoalbuminuria with valsartan (29.9%
      versus 14.5%; P=0.001). Over the study period, BP reductions were similar between
      the two treatments (systolic/diastolic 11.2/6.6 mm Hg for valsartan, 11.6/6.5 mm 
      Hg for amlodipine) and at no time point was there a between-group significant
      difference in BP values in either the hypertensive or the normotensive subgroup. 
      CONCLUSIONS: For the same level of attained BP and the same degree of BP
      reduction, valsartan lowered UAER more effectively than amlodipine in patients
      with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, including the subgroup with baseline
      normotension. This indicates a BP-independent antiproteinuric effect of
      valsartan.

TI  - Two cases of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia induced by the administration of
      verapamil against paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
PG  - 445-8
AB  - Verapamil is widely used for the termination of paroxysmal supraventricular
      tachycardia (PSVT) with little proarrhythmic effect. We describe two cases of
      PSVT that changed to non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia after
      administration of verapamil. Electrophysiological study revealed atrioventricular
      nodal reentrant tachycardia in the first case, and atrioventricular reentrant
      tachycardia due to a concealed left lateral accessory pathway in the second case.
      Catecholamine-induced automaticity was one of the possible mechanisms of VT in
      the first case, but the mechanism is unknown in the second case.

TI  - Nebivolol vs amlodipine as first-line treatment of essential arterial
      hypertension in the elderly.
PG  - 182-8
AB  - The antihypertensive efficacy of nebivolol and amlodipine and their tolerability 
      were compared in a multicentre, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind
      parallel-group trial in elderly patients with mild to moderate essential arterial
      hypertension. One hundred and eighty-four subjects aged > or = 65 years were
      screened. After a run-in phase of 4 weeks, only 168 of these were randomized with
      either nebivolol 2.5-5 mg daily (n = 81) or amlodipine 5-10 mg daily (n = 87)
      over a period of 12 weeks. The response rate to treatment and the changes of
      sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) at week 12 were similar between the two
      groups. A lower sitting systolic BP (SBP) was detected with amlodipine at week 4 
      (p < 0.05) and at week 8 (p < 0.05). Standing BP showed no changes between the
      two groups; only SBP was lower with amlodipine at week 8 (p < 0.05). Heart rate
      was lower at all treatment visits with nebivolol (p < 0.001). The incidence of
      adverse events was no different between the two groups; however the incidence of 
      headache and ankle oedema was significantly higher with amlodipine (p < 0.05). In
      elderly subjects with essential hypertension, the antihypertensive efficacy of
      nebivolol and amlodipine was similar. Both drugs were well tolerated, although
      amlodipine was accompanied by higher incidence of drug-related adverse events.

TI  - Successful blood pressure control in the African American Study of Kidney Disease
      and Hypertension.
PG  - 1636-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) 
      is an ongoing trial to evaluate the effect of blood pressure and choice of
      antihypertensive drug on the rate of decline of renal function. OBJECTIVE: To
      present the success of the AASK in achieving the trial's rigorous blood pressure 
      goals in an extremely challenging patient population. METHODS: The AASK
      participants included African American patients with hypertension (n = 1094),
      aged 18 to 70 years, with glomerular filtration rates between 20 and 65 mL/min
      per 1.73 m(2) and no other identified causes of renal insufficiency. Participants
      were randomized to a goal mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of either 102 to 107
      mm Hg (usual MAP goal) or 92 mm Hg or less (low MAP goal). Participants in each
      of these groups were also randomized (double-blind) to a regimen containing
      metoprolol succinate, ramipril, or amlodipine besylate. Additional agents were
      added, if required, in the following recommended order: furosemide, doxazosin
      mesylate, clonidine hydrochloride, or hydralazine hydrochloride (or minoxidil, if
      needed). RESULTS: In participants randomized to the low MAP goal, the percentage 
      of participants who achieved a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg increased
      from a baseline of 20.0% to 78.9% by 14 months after randomization. For usual MAP
      goal participants, the corresponding percentages increased from 21.5% to 41.8%.
      The difference in median levels of MAP between the 2 MAP goal groups increased
      and remained at approximately 12 mm Hg. Blood pressure reduction was similar
      regardless of age, sex, body mass index, education, insurance or employment
      status, income, or marital status. CONCLUSION: The blood pressure goals set and
      achieved in AASK participants clearly demonstrate that adequate blood pressure
      control can be achieved even in hypertensive populations whose blood pressure is 
      the most difficult to control.

      hypertension: a substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial
      (ASCOT).
PG  - 61-6
AB  - To investigate the relationship between soluble markers of platelet, endothelial 
      and rheological function, and target organ damage and their response to
      intensified management in a population of middle-age hypertensive patients at
      high risk of cardiovascular complications, we studied 382 consecutive patients
      (308 men; mean age, 63 years, SD 8) along with 60 normotensive controls free of
      cardiovascular disease. Patients were divided into those with target organ damage
      (TOD; n=107) and those free of end-organ damage. Plasma levels of soluble
      P-selectin (sP-sel), a marker of platelet activation, and von Willebrand factor
      (vWF), an index of endothelial damage/dysfunction (both enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay), and the rheological indices fibrinogen, plasma viscosity,
      hematocrit, platelet, and white cell count were measured. In 53 patients,
      variables were further measured after 6 months of intensified cardiovascular risk
      management. Patients with TOD had significantly higher vWF, 137 (SD 33) versus
      125 (SD 33) IU/dL (P=0.002,) and a greater proportion of smokers, 31% versus 16% 
      (P=0.002). There were no statistically significant differences in plasma
      viscosity, fibrinogen, hematocrit, white blood cell count, platelet count, or
      sP-sel between the 2 subgroups. In multivariate analysis, vWF was a significant
      independent predictor for TOD. After 6 months of intensified management in 53
      patients who entered the trial, there were significant reductions in systolic
      blood pressure, total cholesterol, hematocrit, plasma viscosity, sP-sel, and vWF 
      (all P<0.01) but no significant change in fibrinogen. In conclusion, there is a
      relationship between TOD and endothelial damage/dysfunction in hypertension.
      Intensified management results in improvements in hemorheology, endothelial and
      platelet function.

TI  - [Effect of antihypertensive combinations on arterial pressure, albuminuria, and
      glycemic control in patients with type II diabetic nephropathy: a randomized
      study].
PG  - 170-8
AB  - Type II diabetic patients with albuminuria are at high risk for cardiovascular
      complications; the intense antihypertensive treatment required often involves
      using drug combinations. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect
      of two different, renin-angiotensin blocking combinations, on blood pressure
      (BP), albuminuria and glycemic control. Its design was prospective, randomised,
      controlled, of parallel branches, and performed in one Endocrinology Department, 
      in Spain. 77 type-II diabetic patients, with stable albuminuria (30-1,000 mg/day)
      were included. After a pre-inclusion time of 2 weeks, patients were randomised to
      verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 (VT) or losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (LH) 20/12.5
      mg/day. Duration of treatment was 1 year. The evaluated parameters were changes
      in blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion for 24 hours, glycated hemoglobin
      and plasmatic urea. Overall BP significantly decreased from 161.6 +/- 18.7/83.6
      +/- 10.2 mmHg to 137.2 +/- 15.7/70.9 +/- 8.3 mmHg (p < 0.0005). Values, by
      treatment, were: For VT, 164.3 +/- 18.5/87.2 +/- 10.7 mmHg at baseline and 135.0 
      +/- 15.1/71.3 +/- 8.4 mmHg at conclusion. For LH, 158.8 +/- 17.4/80.1 +/- 8.4
      mmHg at baseline and 139.3 +/- 16.1/70.5 +/- 8.2 mmHg at conclusion. Albuminuria 
      significantly decreased from 308.2 +/- 544.7 mg/day to 198.0 +/- 285.3 mg/day.
      Both parameters showed no significant difference between treatments. Glycated
      hemoglobin decreased from 7.59 +/- 1.3% to 7.14 +/- 1.2% in the VT group, and
      from 7.96 +/- 1.29% to 7.84 +/- 1.62% in the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.022). Changes
      adjusted from baseline values showed a trend to the difference between both
      treatments (p = 0.092). Plasmatic urea increased from 39.8 +/- 12.7 to 40.5 +/-
      11.1 mg/dL in the TV group and from 43.4 +/- 12.0 mg/dL to 52.4 +/- 19.4 mg/dL in
      the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.028). In conclusion, both treatments reduce blood
      pressure and albuminuria in a similar way in type II diabetic patients. The
      verapamil/trandolapril combination contributes to a better carbohydrate
      metabolism than losartan/hydroclorothiazide.

TI  - A comparison of candesartan, felodipine, and their combination in the treatment
      of elderly patients with systolic hypertension.
PG  - 544-9
AB  - Monotherapy frequently does not cause adequate blood pressure (BP) reduction and 
      goal BP is not achieved. This double-blind, randomized, crossover,
      placebo-controlled study investigated, using a factorial design, the interaction 
      between a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking drug (felodipine 5 mg) and an 
      angiotensin type I receptor blocking drug (candesartan 16 mg) on the control of
      BP as assessed by 24-h ambulatory monitoring. A total of 31 elderly patients with
      systolic hypertension completed all four arms of the study. Candesartan and
      felodipine lowered mean 24-h BP to a similar extent (candesartan 12.2 +/- 2.6/7.5
      +/- 1.8; felodipine 11.9 +/- 2.2/5.7 +/- 1.4 mm Hg). The combination lowered it
      by 21.0 +/- 2.1/11.2 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, and this fall was significantly greater than 
      with either of the monotherapies (P < .005) and was fully additive with no
      interactive term. The responder rate with the combination (90%) was greater than 
      with candesartan (61%) or felodipine (55%). Microalbuminuria or proteinuria was
      present in 12 of 31 patients at randomization despite previous BP control.
      Candesartan and the combination both reduced urinary albumin excretion. Albumin
      excretion was not reduced by felodipine despite BP control similar to that
      achieved with candesartan. Side effects were infrequent and were fewer on the
      combination than on placebo or on the monotherapies. The combination of
      felodipine 5 mg and candesartan 16 mg has additive effects on BP in elderly
      patients with systolic hypertension. The combination was well tolerated and is
      suitable for use in patients who do not have an adequate response to monotherapy.

TI  - [Medicamentous kidney protection in type 2 diabetic patients--is cheaper also
      more economical? A model calculation for Swiss health care].
PG  - 836-44
AB  - Impaired renal function occurs in about 50% of patients suffering from type 2
      diabetes, and diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of endstage renal
      disease. Reduction of blood pressure to levels around 120/80 mmHg is one of the
      most effective way to slow progression of diabetic nephropathy. Recent
      meta-analyses, however, have emphasized on the fact that ACE inhibitors (ACEI)
      and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NDHP-CCB) exert
      nephro-protective effects which go beyond the effect of blood pressure reduction.
      This has lately been confirmed by a prospective trial in comparison to the
      betablocker atenolol. Based on these data, demographics of the Swiss population, 
      literature data on mortality rates of type 2 diabetics with impaired renal
      function and studies on true costs of antihypertensives, we calculated the costs 
      of a longterm intervention (20 years) with antihypertensives in 3536 middle-aged 
      Swiss patients with type 2 diabetes and macro-albuminuria whose antihypertensive 
      regimen was based either on the ACEI lisinopril, or the ND-HP-CCB verapamil, or
      the betablocker atenolol. Under atenolol, acquisition costs were lowest, whereas 
      faster loss of renal function over time increased mortality rate and thus reduced
      the number of patients to be treated. Nevertheless, due to the fact that patients
      reached uremia and had to be dialyzed, 20 years of atenolol-based regimen with
      costs of 316 millions of Swiss francs turned out to be much more expensive than
      the lisinopril- or the verapamil-based regimen with 121 and 38 millions of Swiss 
      francs, respectively. Thus, low acquisition cost is not necessarily the only
      important determinant of overall costs of drug therapy.

TI  - Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of
      antiarrhythmic agents at promoting sinus rhythm in patients with atrial
      fibrillation.
PG  - 535-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to estimate
      the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs at promoting sinus rhythm in patients
      with atrial fibrillation. DESIGN: Articles were identified by using a
      comprehensive search of English language papers indexed in Medline from 1966 to
      August 2001. For the outcomes of sinus rhythm and death, a random effects model
      was used to model repeated assessments within a study at different time points.
      SETTING: Emergency departments and ambulatory clinics. PATIENTS: Patients with
      atrial fibrillation. INTERVENTIONS: Antiarrhythmic agents grouped according to
      their Vaughan-Williams class. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sinus rhythm and mortality. 
      RESULTS: 91 articles met a priori criteria for inclusion in the analysis. Median 
      duration of follow up was one day (range 0.04-1096, mean (SD) 46 (136) days). The
      median proportion of patients in sinus rhythm at follow up was 55% (range 0-100%)
      and 32% (range 0-90%) receiving active treatment and placebo, respectively.
      Median survival was 99% (range 55-100%) and 99% (range 55-100%). Compared with
      placebo, the following drug classes were associated with increased sinus rhythm
      at follow up: IA (treatment difference 21.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 16.3% 
      to 26.8%); IC (treatment difference 33.1%, 95% CI 23.3% to 42.9%); and III
      (treatment difference 17.4%, 95% CI 11.5% to 23.3%). Class IC drugs were
      associated with increased sinus rhythm at follow up compared with class IV drugs 
      (treatment difference 43.2%, 95% CI 11.5% to 75.0%). There was no significant
      difference in mortality between any drug classes. CONCLUSIONS: Class IA, IC, and 
      III drugs are associated with increased sinus rhythm at follow up compared with
      placebo. It is unclear whether any antiarrhythmic drug class is associated with
      increased or decreased mortality.

TI  - [Comparison of nicardipine and isradipine in hypertension following coronary
      artery bypass graft].
PG  - 205-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare the efficacy of isradipine to that of nicardipine for the
      control of arterial hypertension following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).
      STUDY DESIGN: Clinical prospective, randomised study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 40
      patients ASA II or III, mean age 66 +/- 8 years, scheduled for elective CABG were
      included. If the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was > or = 100 mmHg within the
      first six post operative hours, the patients were included and randomly
      attributed to either one of the 2 groups: Gr I (n = 20) received nicardipine, Gr 
      II (n = 20) received isradipine in bolus then in continuous perfusion. HR, MAP,
      MPAP, CVP, PCWP, CI, SVRI, PVRI and SVI were recorded at: T0 before
      administration of drugs, T1 = 2 min after the first bolus. T2 when MAP reached 85
      +/- 5 mmHg. T3, T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8 at 5, 10, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after the 
      continuous perfusion. T9 before stopping the perfusion. RESULTS: No significant
      changes in HR, CVP, PCWP, MPAP or PVRI at any time in both groups. Significant
      increase in CI at T2 in both groups. Reduction of MAP at T2 was more important
      (-27%) in Gr I compared to that in Gr II (-22%). This was mainly due to a
      significant decrease in SVRI. CONCLUSION: Isradipine is effective in the
      treatment of arterial hypertension following CABG. However there is not any
      significant beneficial effect of isradipine over nicardipine.

TI  - Prior calcium channel blockade and short-term survival following acute myocardial
      infarction.
PG  - 487-92
AB  - There is concern over the safety of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in acute
      coronary disease. We sought to determine if patients taking calcium channel
      blockers (CCBs) at the time of admission with acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
      had a higher case-fatality compared with those taking beta-blockers or neither
      medication. Clinical and drug treatment variables at the time of hospital
      admission predictive of survival at 28 days were examined in a community-based
      registry of patients aged under 65 years admitted to hospital for suspected AMI
      in Perth, Australia, between 1984 and 1993. Among 7766 patients, 1291 (16.6%)
      were taking a CCB and 1259 (16.2%) a betablocker alone at hospital admission.
      Patients taking CCBs had a worse clinical profile than those taking a
      beta-blocker alone or neither drug (control group), and a higher unadjusted
      28-day mortality (17.6% versus 9.3% and 11.1% respectively, both P < 0.001).
      There was no significant heterogeneity with respect to mortality between
      nifedipine, diltiazem, or verapamil when used alone, or with a beta-blocker.
      After adjustment for factors predictive of death at 28 days, patients taking a
      CCB were found not to have an excess chance of death compared with the control
      group (odds ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.87, 1.30), whereas
      those taking a beta-blocker alone had a lower odds of death (OR 0.75, 95% CI;
      0.59, 0.94). These results indicate that established calcium channel blockade is 
      not associated with an excess risk of death following AMI once other differences 
      between patients are taken into account, but neither does it have the survival
      advantage seen with prior beta-blocker therapy.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover comparison of five classes of
      antihypertensive drugs.
PG  - 771-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypertension guidelines recommend initial treatment with a
      beta-blocker or diuretic and adding the other drug where blood pressure is not
      controlled. We hypothesized that systematic rotation through the major classes of
      antihypertensive drugs would demonstrate substantial differences in the pattern
      of an individual patient's response, and suggest a more rational approach to
      choosing best treatment. DESIGN: Thirty-four young hypertensives (age 28-55,
      median 47) rotated in a double-blind, Latin-square, crossover fashion through 6
      weeks of treatment each with amlodipine, doxazosin, lisinopril, bisoprolol,
      bendrofluazide and placebo. Blood pressure was measured at each visit. 'Best'
      drug, defined by efficacy and tolerability, was repeated at the end. RESULTS:
      Rotation doubled the number of patients reaching target blood pressure (systolic 
      < 140 mmHg) on one drug (P = 0.03). All five drugs were represented among the
      'best' drugs. In six patients, the blood pressure on 'best' drug was at least 10 
      mmHg lower than on any other. Response to the 'best' drug was highly correlated
      (r = 0.79) with its previous administration. By contrast, there were only weak
      correlations between responses to pairs of drugs, except for
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (A) with beta-blocker (B), and
      calcium blocker (C) with diuretic (D) - each r = 0.71, P < 0.005). In these young
      patients, the majority of patients (23/34) responded best to a drug suppressing
      the renin system (A and B). CONCLUSIONS: Patients vary reproducibly in their
      response to initial treatment, and switching among drugs can increase the
      efficacy of monotherapy. The results support an AB/CD scheme for choosing
      therapy, in which the first drug is taken from one of these pairs, and
      uncontrolled patients switch to one of the other pair.

TI  - Hair darkening in porphyria cutanea tarda.
PG  - 325-9
AB  - Repigmentation of grey hair is rare, but has been described in several clinical
      settings. It has most often been reported as a postinflammatory effect, but
      several drugs, chronic arsenic exposure and coeliac disease have also been cited 
      in addition to darkening as a spontaneous phenomenon. We report two patients with
      sustained repigmentation of the hair in association with porphyria cutanea tarda.
      The mechanism for this repigmentation remains elusive, but presumably involves
      recruitment of outer root sheath melanocytes, which are then activated to form
      functional hair bulb melanocytes.

TI  - Factors related to the occurrence of microalbuminuria during antihypertensive
      treatment in essential hypertension.
PG  - 794-8
AB  - The objective of the study was to assess the factors related to the occurrence of
      microalbuminuria during the follow-up of a young adult group with essential
      hypertension that had not been previously treated. Normo-albuminuric essential
      hypertensives, <50 years old, who had not been previously treated with
      antihypertensive drugs and who did not have diabetes mellitus were included.
      After the initial evaluation, patients were treated using only nonpharmacological
      measures (n=62), beta-blockers (n=38), ACE inhibitors (n=64), calcium channel
      blockers (n=8), and several classes (n=15). Measurements were taken for office
      blood pressure, biochemical profile, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion at the
      beginning of the study and were measured yearly during an average of 2.7+/-1.2
      years of follow-up. Among the 187 patients included, 22 (11,7%) developed
      microalbuminuria (progressors, 4.4/100 patients/y). No differences were present
      between progressors and those who remained normo-albuminuric (nonprogressors) in 
      terms of age, gender, body mass index, disease duration, blood pressure values,
      biochemical profile, familial history of diabetes or hypertension, smoking
      habits, or the presence of EKG left ventricular hypertrophy. The group with the
      lowest progression rate was the patients treated with ACE inhibitors (n=5;
      2.9/100 patients/y), followed by the diet group (n=5; 3.3/100 patients/y) and the
      beta-blockers group (n=5; 4.1/100 patients/y). When we excluded patients treated 
      with calcium channel blockers or those who changed over time between different
      classes of treatment, no significant differences in the incidence of
      microalbuminuria were observed among the groups. Progressors showed higher slopes
      of fasting glucose (4.78+/-11.4 versus 0.50+/-6.8 mg/y, P<0.02) and uric acid
      (0.58+/-0.93 versus 0.05+/-1.10 mg/y, P<0.03) compared with the slopes of
      nonprogressors. Both the slopes for glucose and systolic blood pressure over time
      were associated independently with the slope of the logarithm of urinary albumin 
      excretion when adjusted for age, gender, and treatment groups. Cox proportional
      hazard model for progression of microalbuminuria showed that baseline urinary
      albumin excretion (risk ratio [RR]=1.06; confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.01 to
      1.11), slope for systolic blood pressure (RR=1.11; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.20), and
      slope for glucose (RR=1.08; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.14) were independently associated
      to the development of microalbuminuria. In conclusion, in a group of young adults
      with essential hypertension that had not been previously treated, the main
      factors influencing the occurrence of microalbuminuria during antihypertensive
      treatment were the values of microalbuminuria at baseline and the slopes for
      systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose.

TI  - Cross-sectional study of health-related quality of life in African Americans with
      chronic renal insufficiency: the African American Study of Kidney Disease and
      Hypertension Trial.
PG  - 513-24
AB  - We measured health-related quality of life (HRQL) by using the Medical Outcomes
      Study 36-Item Short-Form (SF-36) in a cross-sectional study of 1,094 African
      American men and women with mild to moderate chronic renal insufficiency (mean
      glomerular filtration rate, 45.7 mL/min/1.73 m2) caused by hypertension before
      randomization onto the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension 
      (AASK) Trial. Scales contributing to physical health and a summary measure, the
      Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (mean, 43.4 +/- 10.9 [SD]), were
      significantly lower than scales relating to mental health and the Mental
      Component Summary (MCS) score (51.3 +/- 10.3). All scales (except Role-Physical) 
      and the PCS and MCS were significantly higher in men (44.3 +/- 10.9 and 51.8 +/- 
      10.0, respectively) than women (41.9 +/- 10.8 and 50.5 +/- 10.6, respectively).
      In multivariate analysis, employment status, education level, household income,
      body mass index, comorbid medical conditions, years of hypertension, number of
      antihypertensive drugs prescribed, exercise status, and male sex were significant
      independent predictors of PCS. Fewer factors predicted MCS and included
      employment status, marital status, current smoking, age, comorbid medical
      conditions, and male sex. In the entire AASK cohort, mean scores for individual
      scales, except Mental Health, and the PCS were lower, but the mean MCS score was 
      slightly higher than values for the US general population. Values for individual 
      scales of the SF-36 and the PCS were substantially higher among AASK participants
      compared with African-American hemodialysis patients. Six of the eight scales
      were lower in the AASK cohort compared with groups of racially mixed and
      exclusively African-American hypertensive subjects. We conclude that physical
      aspects of quality of life are substantially reduced compared with mental
      components among AASK participants, and a number of demographic and clinical
      characteristics significantly impact on HRQL.

TI  - Trough:peak ratio and smoothness index in the evaluation of 24-h blood pressure
      control in hypertension: a comparative study between
      valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination and amlodipine.
PG  - 765-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the time-effect profiles of a
      once-daily administered valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination and amlodipine 
      on blood pressure using various indices derived from 24-h ambulatory blood
      pressure (BP) monitoring. METHODS: Of the 310 randomized outpatients with
      uncomplicated mild-to-moderate primary hypertension, 259 (133 on
      valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 126 on amlodipine) were eligible for analysis.
      After a 2-week placebo wash-out period, the patients were randomly allocated to
      treatment with either valsartan 80 mg once daily (o.d.) or amlodipine 5 mg o.d.
      for 4 weeks; in the case of an unsatisfactory blood pressure response, the
      treatments could be respectively changed to the fixed combination of valsartan 80
      mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg o.d. or amlodipine 10 mg o.d. for a further 8
      weeks. The trough:peak ratio (global and individualized approaches) and
      smoothness index (i.e., the ratio between the average of the 24-hourly BP changes
      after treatment and the corresponding standard deviation) were calculated from
      24-h ambulatory blood pressure recordings made after the placebo period and after
      4 weeks and 12 weeks of active treatment. RESULTS: Both regimens effectively
      lowered systolic and diastolic ambulatory pressures after 4 weeks and 12 weeks
      (all P<0.001) but, among the responders, the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide
      combination had a greater antihypertensive effect during the night-time hours
      after 12 weeks (P=0.03/0.02). In the responders, the placebo-adjusted, mean
      trough:peak ratios were 0.76/0.74 in the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide group (n =
      111) and 0.66/0.62 in the amlodipine group (n = 101). The corresponding global
      trough:peak ratios were 0.61/0.57 for the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide
      combination and 0.56/0.56 for amlodipine. However, the between-group differences 
      in individual or global trough:peak ratios were not significant. The smoothness
      index was slightly, but insignificantly, greater for
      valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide than for amlodipine in the responders and the
      groups as a whole. CONCLUSION: Valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine were 
      equally effective in reducing ambulatory BP, but the
      valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination led to more homogeneous BP control
      during the inter-dosing interval. Trough:peak ratio and smoothness index did not 
      reflect this finding accurately.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine compared to atenolol on small arteries of previously
      untreated essential hypertensive patients.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - In a previous retrospective study, long-term treatment of essential hypertensive 
      patients with a slow-release calcium channel blocker resulted in normal
      resistance artery structure and endothelial function, which did not occur with a 
      beta-blocker. In the present prospective study, 19 previously untreated essential
      hypertensive patients (aged 47 +/- 2 years, 75% male) were treated for 1 year in 
      a double-blind randomized study with the long-acting calcium channel blocker
      amlodipine or the beta-blocker atenolol. Resistance arteries (lumen diameter, 150
      to 350 microm) dissected from gluteal subcutaneous biopsies were studied on a
      pressurized myograph. Blood pressure (BP) control (129 +/- 2/85 +/- 2 mm Hg) was 
      identical in both groups for the last 6 months of the study. After 1 year of
      treatment with amlodipine, the media-to-lumen ratio (M/L) of resistance arteries 
      decreased from 7.89% +/- 0.40% to 6.81% +/- 0.41% (P < .05).
      Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation tended to improve from
      84.3% +/- 5.5% to 90.5% +/- 4.8% (P = .06), whereas sodium nitroprusside-induced 
      relaxation was unchanged in the patients treated with amlodipine. In the
      beta-blocker-treated group there was no significant change in M/L or
      acetylcholine-induced relaxation. In conclusion, treatment with the calcium
      channel blocker amlodipine corrected altered resistance artery structure and
      tended to improve endothelial function in essential hypertensive patients,
      whereas similar good control of BP with the beta-blocker atenolol did not.
      Whether the vascular protective effect of amlodipine will result in improved
      outcomes in hypertension remains to be demonstrated.

TI  - Relationship between treatment-induced changes in left ventricular mass and blood
      pressure in black african hypertensive patients: results of the Baragwanath
      Trial.
PG  - 830-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a single-center study, we compared to what extent changes in
      conventional and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) predicted regression of left
      ventricular mass (LVM) index in response to antihypertensive treatment in
      previously untreated and treated patients with sustained hypertension. METHODS
      AND RESULTS: We enrolled 173 black African patients who, off treatment, had a
      daytime diastolic BP ranging from 90 to 114 mm Hg. Antihypertensive drugs were
      titrated and combined to reduce the daytime diastolic BP below 90 mm Hg.
      Echocardiograms were obtained at baseline and follow-up. Mean systolic/diastolic 
      clinic BP, 24-hour BP, and LVM index were similar in previously untreated (n=64) 
      and previously treated (n=109) patients and averaged 171/102 mm Hg, 151/97 mm Hg,
      and 118 g/m2, respectively. At 4 months, these values had decreased (P<0.001) by 
      26/12 mm Hg, 23/14 mm Hg, and 14 g/m2 in previously untreated patients and by
      22/9 mm Hg, 21/13 mm Hg, and 19 g/m2 in previously treated patients. In the
      previously untreated patients, the regression in LVM index correlated to a
      similar degree (P=0.09) with the decreases in the conventional (r=0.34; P=0.005) 
      and the 24-hour (r=0.26; P=0.04) systolic BP. In the previously treated patients,
      the corresponding correlations were 0.02 (P=0.82) and -0.10 (P=0.32),
      respectively. Compared with the 24-hour systolic BP, automated oscillometric
      measurements of systolic BP obtained at the clinic yielded similar results.
      CONCLUSIONS: In previously untreated patients with sustained hypertension
      followed at a single center, reductions in clinic and ambulatory systolic
      pressure in response to antihypertensive treatment equally predicted the
      regression in LVM index.

TI  - Withdrawal from treatment in the Syst-Eur Trial.
PG  - 339-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reasons for withdrawal from double-blind randomized
      trials, and the reasons for changing treatment within a randomized therapeutic
      group. DESIGN: The Syst-Eur trial, in which 4695 older patients with systolic
      hypertension were randomized to active or placebo treatment. METHODS: The reasons
      for withdrawal from the trial were examined, both for patient-initiated and
      investigator-initiated withdrawals. In addition, the reasons for stopping the
      first-line treatment (nitrendipine), the second-line treatments (enalapril and
      hydrochlorothiazide) and the corresponding placebos, were determined. RESULTS: A 
      total of 135 patients (6%) were withdrawn by the investigators from placebo
      treatment because their blood pressure was too high, and, similarly, 36 (1.6%)
      through patient initiation. The corresponding results for the actively treated
      patients were 14 (0.6%) and 7 (0.3%). Very few patients were withdrawn from the
      trial because of the adverse effects of treatment. However, 39 (4%) stopped
      taking active nitrendipine because of ankle oedema, compared with 4 (0.5%) on
      placebo. Similarly, 28 versus three stopped due to flushing. Forty-one (10%)
      stopped taking enalapril because of cough, against eight (2%) for enalapril
      placebo. In all, 15.0% stopped active nitrendipine, 20.2% enalapril and 6.3%
      hydrochlorothiazide, versus placebo 7.1, 9.1 and 5.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The numbers
      withdrawn from the trial for adverse treatment consequences were small in
      comparison to the cardiovascular benefits. Nevertheless the numbers stopping
      individual treatments were higher than expected.

TI  - Effects of losartan and its combination with quinapril on the cardiac sympathetic
      nervous system and neurohormonal status in essential hypertension.
PG  - 103-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems play important roles
      in essential hypertension. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of
      losartan or its combination with quinapril on the cardiac nervous system and
      neurohormonal status in essential hypertension. DESIGN AND METHODS: Randomized,
      comparative study of 105 patients with mild essential hypertension, carried out
      at Shizuoka General Hospital. In phase 1, 40 hypertensives were allocated
      randomly into the losartan (50 mg) group or the quinapril (10 mg) group. In phase
      2, 65 hypertensives, after 3 months 10 mg quinapril monotherapy, were allocated
      randomly into groups with 50 mg losartan (n = 32) or 5 mg amlodipine (n = 33)
      added to quinapril, and were treated for a further 3 months. All patients
      underwent [(123)I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging and neurohormonal
      measurements before and 3 months after treatment. RESULTS: Both monotherapies
      significantly increased renin activity, while losartan monotherapy also increased
      angiotensin II (AII) concentration. In both the losartan and quinapril groups,
      the washout rate was significantly decreased (18.1 +/- 11.4 versus 13.9 +/-
      11.0%, P < 0.0002 and 13.3 +/- 9.3 versus 12.3 +/- 9.1%, P < 00001, respectively)
      without changes in the heart to mediastinum ratio (H/M ratio). Both combined
      therapies lowered blood pressure to similar levels. A combination therapy with
      losartan and quinapril significantly increased the H/M ratio (1.93 +/- 0.29 and
      2.02 +/- 0.29, P < 0.01) and decreased the washout rate (17.6 +/- 11.0 and 15.3
      +/- 9.2%, P < 0.02) without affecting AII concentration, whereas a combination
      therapy with amlodipine and quinapril therapy did not affect the scintigraphic
      parameters with an increase in the AII concentration. CONCLUSIONS: With a usual
      antihypertensive dose, both losartan and quinapril had a little suppressive
      effect on the cardiac sympathetic activity in essential hypertension. In
      contrast, the combination therapy with losartan and quinapril, which results in a
      higher degree of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, could suppress the
      cardiac sympathetic activity effectively.

TI  - Effect of two antihypertensive combinations on metabolic control in type-2
      diabetic hypertensive patients with albuminuria: a randomised, double-blind
      study.
PG  - 849-56
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare, at equal blood pressure (BP)
      reduction, the effect of two different combinations on metabolic control and
      albuminuria in type 2 diabetic hypertensive patients with albuminuria. This was a
      prospective, randomised, double-blind, parallel, controlled trial carried out in 
      11 Spanish hospitals. A total of 103 type 2 diabetic patients with stable
      albuminuria and BP not controlled on monotherapy were randomised of which 93
      finished the study. After a 4-week single-blind placebo period, patients were
      randomised to verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg (VT) or to
      enalapril/hydroclorothiazide 20/12.5 mg (EH). Treatment duration was 6 months.
      The main outcome measures were changes in BP, 24-h albuminuria, blood glucose and
      glycated haemoglobin. Overall BP was significantly reduced from 157.3 +/-
      12.0/98.3 +/- 6.4 mm Hg to 140.5 +/- 14.5/86.1 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and
      albuminuria significantly decreased from 508.6 +/- 693.8 mg/24 h to 253.4 +/-
      517.2 mg/24 h (P < 0.001), both without significant differences between
      treatments. Glycated haemoglobin was not modified on VT: baseline, 5.91 +/-
      1.43%; end of treatment, 5.94 +/- 1.62%, but increased on EH: baseline, 5.96 +/- 
      1.25%; final, 6.41 +/- 1.51%, (ANOVA interaction P = 0.040). At the end of the
      study, a blood glucose <126 mg/dL was attained in 72.7% of the VT group-improving
      in 29.5% and worsening in 6.8% of patients (P = 0.021)-and in 50% of the EH
      group, 13.6% of patients improved and 11.4% worsened (P = 1.000). There were no
      changes in body weight, serum creatinine, uric acid, potassium, cholesterol,
      tryglicerides and serum albumin. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients not
      controlled on monotherapy, both treatments similarly reduced albuminuria. The
      combination verapamil/ trandolapril seems to allow a better metabolic control
      than enalapril/hydroclorothiazide.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.
PG  - 1061-73
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the epidemiology, mechanisms, complications, predictors,
      prevention, and treatment of atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery. DATA 
      SOURCES: MEDLINE search of English-language reports published between 1966 and
      2000 and a search of references of relevant papers. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical and
      basic research studies on atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. DATA
      EXTRACTION: Relevant clinical information was extracted from selected articles.
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Atrial fibrillation occurs in 10% to 65% of patients after
      cardiac surgery, usually on the second or third postoperative day. Postoperative 
      atrial fibrillation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and
      longer, more expensive hospital stays. Prophylactic use of beta-adrenergic
      blockers reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation and should be
      administered before and after cardiac surgery to all patients without
      contraindication. Prophylactic amiodarone and atrial overdrive pacing should be
      considered in patients at high risk for postoperative atrial fibrillation (for
      example, patients with previous atrial fibrillation or mitral valve surgery). For
      patients who develop atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, a strategy of
      rhythm management or rate management should be selected. For patients who are
      hemodynamically unstable or highly symptomatic or who have a contraindication to 
      anticoagulation, rhythm management with electrical cardioversion, amiodarone, or 
      both is preferred. Treatment of the remaining patients should focus on rate
      control because most will spontaneously revert to sinus rhythm within 6 weeks
      after discharge. All patients with atrial fibrillation persisting for more than
      24 to 48 hours and without contraindication should receive anticoagulation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrillation frequently complicates cardiac surgery. Many
      cases can be prevented with appropriate prophylactic therapy. A strategy of
      rhythm management for symptomatic patients and rate management for all other
      patients usually results in reversion to sinus rhythm within 6 weeks of
      discharge.

TI  - Comparison of 24-hour blood pressure profiles in patients with hypertension who
      were switched from amlodipine to nisoldipine.
PG  - 898-903
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare 24-hour blood pressure control and adverse effects in
      patients with essential hypertension who were switched from amlodipine to
      nisoldipine. DESIGN: Open-label, one-way crossover study. SETTING: Cardiac clinic
      and patients' homes. PATIENTS: Twenty-five patients with stage I or II essential 
      hypertension stabilized with amlodipine for at least 3 months, of whom 21
      patients completed the study. INTERVENTION: All patients underwent 24-hour
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring while receiving amlodipine 5 or 10 mg/day.
      Patients then were switched to nisoldipine 10 mg/day (> or = 65 yrs old) or 20
      mg/day (< 65 yrs old) and returned to the clinic at 2-week intervals to assess
      cuff blood pressure, heart rate, adverse effects, and compliance. No adverse
      effects were experienced in 15 of the 25 patients. Lower extremity edema was the 
      most commonly reported adverse effect (four patients). Two patients discontinued 
      treatment because of pulmonary edema in one and chest pain in the other. Two
      patients were lost to follow-up. After a mean of 10.6 weeks, repeat 24-hour
      ambulatory monitoring was performed to evaluate blood pressure control with
      nisoldipine. Systolic and diastolic ambulatory results for daytime, nighttime,
      and total 24 hours were calculated. For amlodipine versus nisoldipine, no
      significant differences existed in any of the blood pressure parameters (p>0.05) 
      in the 21 patients who completed the study, except for 24-hour diastolic pressure
      (p<0.05); however, this latter difference was only 2 mm Hg (nisoldipine 77 mm Hg,
      amlodipine 75 mm Hg). CONCLUSION: Both amlodipine and nisoldipine have similar
      24-hour ambulatory blood pressure profiles. The frequency of lower extremity
      edema was no different after the switch to nisoldipine than when the patients
      were taking amlodipine.

TI  - The gingival inflammatory infiltrate in cardiac patients treated with calcium
      antagonists.
PG  - 897-903
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the periodontal inflammatory infiltrates in patients with 
      cardiac disease, some of these patients were treated with calcium antagonists
      (nifedipine and diltiazem) and some were not, to compare them with a healthy
      control group, and to evaluate the changes in the inflammatory infiltrate after
      periodontal treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A "healthy group" (HG, n=12), a
      "cardiac group" (CG, n=12) without treatment with calcium antagonists, a
      "nifedipine group" (NG, n=18) and a "diltiazem group" (DG, n=13) were analysed.
      Biopsies were taken from a zone 2-3 mm below the upper part of the interproximal 
      papillae 12-13 and 33-32 before causal periodontal treatment and after 1 year.
      Using haematoxylin-eosin staining, the plasma cells (P), lymphocytes (L),
      histiocytes (H) and polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) were counted. T and B
      lymphocytes were evaluated using the monoclonal antibodies anti-CD20 and
      anti-CD45RO. Statistical tests used: chi2 for study of the sample composition;
      ANOVA for comparison between groups; Student t-test and Wilcoxon test for
      comparison between visits; post-hoc test Bonferroni. RESULTS: When the cells were
      compared statistically, differences were established for L at the first visit
      (p<0.00001) and at the last visit (p<0.02), for the B lymphocytes (first visit
      p<0.0021, last visit p<0.022) and for the T lymphocytes (first visit p<0.0042,
      last visit p<0.0021). Between the 2 visits, HG showed significant reductions for 
      P (p<0.01), L (p<0.045) and H (p<0.033); and the NG for L (p<0.0001). Lymphocytes
      showed differences in the NG with respect to the B lymphocytes (p<0.008).
      CONCLUSIONS: Nifedipine affects the inflammatory infiltrate with a greater number
      of lymphocytes (especially B) and these cells fell significantly in number after 
      periodontal treatment.

TI  - Guidelines for the management of patients with chronic stable angina: treatment.
PG  - 616-32
AB  - The dual aims of treating patients with chronic stable angina are 1) to reduce
      morbidity and mortality and 2) to eliminate angina with minimal adverse effects
      and allow the patient to return to normal activities. In the absence of
      contraindications, beta-blockers are recommended as initial therapy. All
      beta-blockers seem to be equally effective. If the patient has serious
      contraindications to beta-blockers, unacceptable side effects, or persistent
      angina, calcium antagonists should be administered. Long-acting dihydropyridine
      and nondihydropyridine agents are generally as effective as beta-blockers in
      relieving angina. Long-acting nitrates are considered third-line therapy because 
      a nitrate-free interval is required to avoid developing tolerance. All
      long-acting nitrates seem to be equally effective. Patients with angina should
      take 75 to 325 mg of aspirin daily unless they have contraindications. Such risk 
      factors as smoking, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, diabetes,
      and hypertension should be treated appropriately. Coronary revascularization has 
      not been shown to improve survival for most patients with chronic angina but may 
      be required to control symptoms. However, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 
      is often indicated for symptomatic patients with left-main disease, three-vessel 
      disease, or two-vessel disease including proximal stenosis of the left anterior
      descending coronary artery; it improves their survival. Percutaneous transluminal
      coronary angioplasty is an alternative to CABG for patients with normal left
      ventricular function and favorable angiographic features. Coronary artery bypass 
      grafting is initially more effective in relieving angina than medical therapy,
      but the two procedures yield similar results after 5 to 10 years. Eighty percent 
      of patients who undergo CABG remain angina-free 5 years after surgery. In
      low-risk patients, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty seems to
      control angina better than medical therapy, but recurrent angina and repeated
      procedures are more likely than with CABG. Patient education is an important
      component of management. Long-term follow-up should be individualized to
      ascertain clinical stability at regular intervals and to reassess prognosis when 
      warranted.

TI  - A multicenter, randomized double-blind study of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide
      combination versus amlodipine in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
PG  - 1691-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a
      once-daily fixed valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination and amlodipine 
      in subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: In this
      multicentre, double-blind, randomized, comparative trial, 690 patients with
      sitting systolic blood pressure (BP) > or = 160 mmHg and sitting diastolic BP >
      or = 95 mmHg at the end of a 2-week placebo wash-out period were randomized to
      valsartan-based treatment (n = 342) or amlodipine (n = 348). METHODS: The
      patients received valsartan 80 mg o.d. or amlodipine 5 mg o.d for 4 weeks; in the
      case of an unsatisfactory blood pressure response, the treatments could be
      respectively changed to the fixed combination of valsartan 80 mg + HCTZ 12.5 mg
      o.d. or amlodipine 10 mg o.d. for a further 8 weeks. RESULTS: Both treatment
      approaches decreased systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure to the 
      same extent. The rate of responders to treatment at the end of fourth week
      (before up-titration) was 57.4% among the valsartan-treated patients and 61.9%
      among the amlodipine-treated patients (ns). At the end of the study, the rate of 
      responders was not significantly different between the two groups (74.9 versus
      72.1%). Valsartan-based treatment had a slightly lower incidence of adverse
      events (1.5 versus 5.5%; P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial
      demonstrate that the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination and amlodipine are
      equally effective in lowering BP, and that the combination is better tolerated.

TI  - Interaction between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug intake and
      calcium-channel blocker-based antihypertensive treatment in the Syst-Eur trial.
PG  - 613-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between chronic intake of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and outcome, in particular (gastrointestinal)
      bleeding and to investigate whether the effect of chronic NSAID intake was
      similar in untreated and treated elderly hypertensives. METHODS: Eligible
      patients (> or = 60 years, with systolic blood pressure 160-219 mm Hg and
      diastolic blood pressure < 95 mm Hg) were randomised to active treatment or
      placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine, with the possible addition
      of enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, or both, titrated or combined to reduce the
      sitting systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg to below 150 mm Hg. Patients
      never taking NSAIDs (n = 2882) were compared with patients on chronic NSAID
      intake (n = 861), defined as reporting NSAID intake on at least 50% of the
      patient forms. RESULTS: There was a tendency towards lower mortality (relative
      hazard rate (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77 (0.56-1.06)) and higher incidence
      of bleeding (1.13 (0.63-2.05) with chronic NSAID intake. Although there was no
      significant interaction between calcium-channel blocker (CCB)-based treatment and
      chronic NSAID intake for any of the end points, chronic NSAID intake tended to be
      associated with a lower incidence of bleeding on active treatment as compared to 
      placebo (P-value of the interaction term = 0.07). CONCLUSION: The effect of
      chronic NSAID intake on outcome was similar in patients on active treatment based
      on a dihydropyridine CCB or on placebo. However, chronic NSAID intake might have 
      a less deleterious effect on bleeding on active treatment as compared to placebo.

TI  - Incidental retinal phototoxicity associated with ingestion of photosensitizing
      drugs.
PG  - 501-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: to report on the possible correlation between incident retinal
      phototoxicity and the use of photosensitizing drugs. METHODS: four patients were 
      examined because of scotomas and visual loss after an incidental exposure to a
      strong light source. One patient (two eyes) was exposed to standard camera flash;
      one patient (one eye) had a brief exposure to welding light; one patient (two
      eyes) underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsifications with intraocular lens
      implantation. The fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a
      secondary intraocular lens implantation. All four patients underwent a thorough
      assessment including history of systemic drug use. These patients had
      ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts),
      fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were
      followed for 1 year. RESULTS: on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 
      (range: 20/400-20/20). Fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal
      lesions in all affected eyes. Early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or
      multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window
      defect. In the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye.
      Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with 
      ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. The
      common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one 
      or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and
      benzodiazepines). Three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months
      after the phototoxicity. The fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of
      20/60 12 months after the light exposure. Despite the visual recovery,
      non-homogeneous retinal pigment epithelial disturbances persisted in all affected
      eyes. CONCLUSION: phototoxicity following incidental light exposure may occur in 
      patients taking drugs of photosensitizing potential. Therefore, the thorough
      history of systemic drug ingestion should be obtained if patients have exposure
      to strong light sources.

TI  - Relation between drug treatment and cancer in hypertensives in the Swedish Trial 
      in Old Patients with Hypertension 2: a 5-year, prospective, randomised,
      controlled trial.
PG  - 539-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Is cancer related to hypertension and blood pressure? Do
      antihypertensive drugs promote cancer? Do antihypertensive drugs protect against 
      cancer? We previously analysed the frequency of cardiovascular mortality and
      morbidity in elderly people who participated in the Swedish Trial in Old Patients
      with Hypertension 2 (STOP-Hypertension-2). We have also looked at the frequency
      of cancer in these patients. METHODS: We randomly assigned 6614 elderly patients 
      with hypertension (mean age 76 years, median time of follow-up 5.3 years) to one 
      of three treatment strategies: conventional drugs (diuretics or b-blockers),
      calcium antagonists, or ACE inhibitors. We matched the patients to the Swedish
      Cancer Registry and compared our findings with expected values based on age, sex,
      and calendar-year-specific reference frequencies for the general Swedish
      population. We also compared the number of cancers between the three treatment
      groups. FINDINGS: At baseline, 607 (9%) patients had previous malignant disease. 
      Diagnoses were closely similar to the distribution of cancer types that might be 
      seen in elderly patients. During follow-up, there were 625 new cases of cancer in
      590 patients. The frequency of cancer did not differ significantly between the
      treatment strategies, including all cancers and those at individual sites. The
      standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for all cancers were also close to unity:
      0.92 (95% CI 0.80-1.06) for conventional drugs, 0.96 (0.83-1.10) for calcium
      antagonists, and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for ACE inhibitors. INTERPRETATIONS: No
      difference in cancer risk was seen between patients randomly assigned to
      conventional drugs, calcium antagonists, or ACE inhibitors. Thus, the general
      message to the practising physician is that more attention should be given to
      getting the blood pressure down than to the risk of cancer.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to compare the anti-hypertensive
      effects of imidapril and nifedipine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate
      essential hypertension.
PG  - 154-62
AB  - This 12-week, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      compared efficacy of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidapril 
      5 - 10 mg/day and the calcium channel blocker nifedipine slow-release (SR)
      formulation 20 - 40 mg twice daily. In total 320 patients aged 18 - 75 years,
      with mean sitting diastolic blood pressures of 95 - 115 mmHg, were randomized to 
      treatment with imidapril (n = 157) or nifedipine SR (n = 163). Efficacy
      evaluations were based on the intent-to-treat principle. On study completion,
      there was no difference between the groups with respect to the primary efficacy
      variable of response to treatment (imidapril 63.1%; nifedipine SR 61.3%). After 2
      weeks' treatment, clinically relevant decreases in blood pressure were observed
      in both groups, with a trend towards further reductions until study end. Fewer
      patients in the imidapril-treated group than the nifedipine group withdrew due to
      adverse events that occurred on treatment with study medication (3.2% versus
      16.0%) or experienced adverse events (40.1% versus 49.7%). In addition, fewer
      adverse events were causally related to imidapril (24.2%) compared with
      nifedipine SR (41.7%). These results show that imidapril is effective in the
      treatment of essential hypertension and is better tolerated than nifedipine SR.

TI  - Once-daily treatment of patients with hypertension: a placebo-controlled study of
      amlodipine and benazepril vs amlodipine or benazepril alone.
PG  - 495-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of once-daily
      therapy with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg vs amlodipine 5 mg, benazepril 10
      mg, and placebo. DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, multicentre trial. SETTING: Twenty-two clinical centres,
      including private practice groups and academic research clinics.Patients: A total
      of 530 patients between 21 and 80 years of age with essential hypertension were
      screened for the study, and 454 were randomised to treatment with amlodipine 5
      mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, benazepril 10 mg, or placebo for 8 weeks.
      RESULTS: Amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg produced greater reductions from
      baseline in sitting diastolic blood pressure than amlodipine 5 mg (P < 0.03),
      benazepril 10 mg (P < 0.001), and placebo (P < 0.001). The response rate in the
      amlodipine 5-mg/benazepril 10-mg treatment group (66.4%) was better than that
      observed in the amlodipine 5-mg (50.0% P < 0.02), benazepril 10-mg (38.3% P <
      0.001), and placebo (24.4% P < 0.001) groups. There was no significant difference
      in heart rate among the four groups. The incidence of oedema in the amlodipine
      5-mg/benazepril 10-mg (1.7%) group was somewhat less than that in the amlodipine 
      5-mg (4.5%) group. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg was
      well tolerated and was superior to amlodipine 5 mg, benazepril 10 mg, and placebo
      in reducing sitting diastolic blood pressure in patients with essential
      hypertension.

TI  - Calcium channel blocker nifedipine slows down progression of coronary
      calcification in hypertensive patients compared with diuretics.
PG  - 1410-3
AB  - Calcium controls numerous events within the vessel wall. Permeability of the
      endothelium is calcium dependent, as are platelet activation and adhesion,
      vascular smooth muscle proliferation and migration, and synthesis of fibrous
      connective tissue. Double-helix computerized tomography is a noninvasive
      technique that can detect, measure, and compare coronary calcification in the
      coronary arteries. Using this method, our objective was to determine whether
      administration of nifedipine once daily in lieu of diuretics in high-risk
      hypertensive patients will arrest or slow down the progression of coronary artery
      calcification. The study was designed as a side arm of INSIGHT (International
      Nifedipine Study: Intervention as Goal for Hypertension Therapy), aimed to show
      the efficacy of nifedipine once daily versus co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25
      mg, amiloride 2.5 mg) in high-risk hypertensive patients. A total of 201 patients
      with a total calcium score of >/=10 at the onset of study who underwent an annual
      double-helix computerized tomography for 3 years were analyzed for efficacy.
      Inhibition of coronary calcium progression was significant in the nifedipine
      versus the co-amilozide group during the first year (3.18% versus 27%,
      respectively, P=0.02), not significant during the second year (28.5% versus 47%, 
      respectively, P=0.14), and significant during the third year (40% versus 78%,
      respectively, P=0.02). The results point to a slower progression of coronary
      calcification in hypertensive patients on nifedipine once daily versus
      co-amilozide.

TI  - [Tocolysis with calcium-channel-blockers].
PG  - 246-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of calcium-channel-blockers (CCBs) for tocolysis. 
      METHODS: We reviewed the literature retrieved from the Medline database from 1967
      to 200 dealing with fetal toxicity and efficacy of CCBs compared with
      beta-adrenergic agonists. RESULTS: Data on fetal toxicity in animals were
      inconsistent. A teratologic effect has been observed during early pregnancy at
      supratherapeutic dosage. At usual therapeutic dosage, no fetal abnormalities have
      been observed. The efficacy of CBs for tocolysis is superior to that of
      beta-adrenergic drugs and allows a reduction of neonatal morbidity. Calcium
      channel blockers are better tolerated than beta-adrenergic agonists. CONCLUSION: 
      Published data suggest that CCBs could be used a first line tocolytic agents.
      Although use of CCBs is extremely simple, they should not be prescribed in
      low-risk outpatients.

TI  - Prevalence and risk of gingival enlargement in patients treated with nifedipine.
PG  - 605-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gingival enlargement is a known side effect of nifedipine use. This
      study was conducted to determine the prevalence and risk factors for gingival
      enlargement in nifedipine-treated patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted in a primary care center. Data from 65 patients taking nifedipine were 
      compared with 147 controls who had never received the drug. All patients were
      examined for the presence of gingival enlargement using 2 different indices:
      vertical gingival overgrowth index (GO) in 6 points around each tooth, and
      horizontal MB index in the interdental area. Gingival index, plaque index, and
      probing depth were also evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of gingival
      enlargement was significantly higher in nifedipine-treated cases than in controls
      (GO index, 33.8% versus 4.1%; MB index, 50.8% versus 7.5%, respectively). Higher 
      gingival and plaque indices were observed in patients taking nifedipine. Among
      the possible risk factors, only the gingival index showed a significant
      association with gingival enlargement. The risk (odds ratio [OR]) of gingival
      enlargement associated with nifedipine therapy was 10.6 (3.8-29.1) for the GO
      index and 14.4 (6-34.6) for the MB index. Gingival index-adjusted ORs were 9.6
      (3.3-28.1) and 9.7 (3.9-23.3), respectively. In the subset of high nifedipine
      exposure patients, the odds ratio for gingival enlargement increased to 17.4
      (5.3-56.3) for the GO index and 23.6 (7.7-72.3) for the MB index. The concordance
      between GO and MB indices showed a kappa value of 0.689 in controls and 0.642 in 
      patients treated with nifedipine. CONCLUSIONS: Patients taking nifedipine are at 
      high risk for gingival enlargement, and gingivitis acts as a predisposing factor.

TI  - Heart rate-lowering calcium antagonists in hypertensive post-myocardial
      infarction patients.
PG  - 977-82
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse effects of a heart rate-lowering calcium antagonist in
      hypertensive post-myocardial infarction patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: From three 
      large, randomized, placebo-controlled, secondary prevention trials investigating 
      verapamil or diltiazem (the first and second Danish Verapamil Infarction Trials
      and the Multicentre Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial) data from a total of 1,325
      hypertensive post-myocardial infarction patients (drugs = 667, placebo = 658)
      were pooled to assess effect of blinded therapy on mortality and event rates.
      RESULTS: Treatment with heart rate-lowering calcium antagonists was associated
      with significant reduction in event rates [21.4 versus 27.4%; risk ratio (RR) =
      0.76, confidence interval (CI) = 0.61 -0.95, P= 0.013]. Mortality rates in the
      treatment group were 15.1 versus 17.5% in the control group (RR = 0.87, CI =
      0.66-1.13, P= 0.296). Among the subset of 964 hypertensive patients without
      pulmonary congestion, there was some reduction in mortality rate (11.3 versus
      15.3% in the control group; RR = 0.72, P= 0.066) and significant reduction in
      event rates (18 versus 24.4% for control group; RR = 0.70, P= 0.011). In patients
      with pulmonary congestion and hypertension, however, calcium antagonists were
      associated with a 25% increase in mortality (RR = 1.25, P= 0.339), while event
      rate RR was 1.00. After an adjustment for significant covariates, RR for
      mortality in treatment versus control groups was 0.76 (P= 0.159). For event
      rates, RR was 0.74 (P= 0.057). CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate-lowering calcium
      antagonists decrease event rates in hypertensive post-myocardial infarction
      patients, but only in those without pulmonary congestion.

TI  - [Amlodipine versus nifedipine retard. A randomized double-blind comparative study
      on long-term efficacy and safety of amlodipine and nifedipine retard in the
      monotherapy of chronic stable angina pectoris].
PG  - 149-56
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHOD: This double-blind study compared the efficacy and safety of 
      once daily amlodipine (5-10 mg/day) vs twice daily nifedipine (40-80 mg/day) in
      244 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. Efficacy was assessed after 4
      and 24 weeks by bicycle exercise test. RESULTS: No statistically significant
      differences were found between the two treatment groups at the end of treatment
      with regard to the ergometry parameters determined (maximum ST segment deviation,
      maximum workload in watts, maximum exercise duration and time to 0.1 mV ST
      segment depression). Furthermore, the two treatment groups were comparable with
      regard to the effected reduction in anginal attacks and short acting nitrate
      consumption. The incidence of adverse events was lower in the amlodipine relative
      to the nifedipine group (11.5% vs 19.1%). CONCLUSION: The results of this study
      show that once daily amlodipine offers comparable antianginal and antiischemic
      efficacy as twice daily sustained release nifedipine in the monotreatment of
      chronic stable angina pectoris. Given the lower incidence of adverse events with 
      amlodipine and its convenient once daily dosing regimen, however, amlodipine may 
      help to enhance patient compliance.

TI  - Diltiazem treatment does not alter renal function after thoracic surgery.
PG  - 1476-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are conflicting reports on the effects of diltiazem treatment
      on renal function in surgical patients. We sought to determine whether diltiazem 
      treatment alters renal function in patients undergoing major thoracic surgery.
      METHODS: In a prospective study, 330 patients scheduled for elective thoracic
      surgery received either IV diltiazem (n = 167) or placebo (n = 163) immediately
      after the operation and orally thereafter for 14 days in an effort to prevent
      postoperative atrial arrhythmias. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were compared
      before and during the first postoperative week. RESULTS: Patients treated with
      diltiazem were similar to control subjects in terms of age (mean +/-SD, 66 +/- 10
      years vs 67 +/- 10 years, respectively), baseline serum creatinine or BUN levels,
      prevalence of comorbid conditions, and surgical characteristics. During the first
      5 postoperative days, the two groups did not differ in terms of serum creatinine 
      or BUN levels. The incidence of renal failure was 0.6% in the diltiazem group and
      1.2% in the placebo group (difference was not significant). There was no
      difference in the length of hospitalization or mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: In
      patients without renal disease who are undergoing elective thoracic surgery,
      prophylactic diltiazem treatment did not alter postoperative renal function.

TI  - Effects of chlorthalidone and diltiazem on myocardial ischemia in elderly
      patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease.
PG  - 268-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antihypertensive therapy with thiazides decreases coronary events in
      elderly patients. However, the influence of diuretics on myocardial ischemia has 
      not been fully investigated. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of
      chlorthalidone and diltiazem on myocardial ischemia. METHODS: Following a
      randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol, we studied 15 elderly hypertensive 
      patients aged 73.6+/-4.6 years with myocardial ischemia. All patients had
      angiographically documented coronary artery disease. We measured patients using
      48- hour ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring and exercise testing. After a
      2-week period using placebo, patients received chlorthalidone or diltiazem for 4 
      weeks. RESULTS: Both treatments lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures.
      The number of ischemic episodes on ambulatory electrocardiogram recordings was
      reduced with the use of chlorthalidone (2.5+/-3.8) and diltiazem (3.2+/-4.2) when
      compared with placebo (7.9+/-8.8; p<0.05). The total duration of ischemic
      episodes was reduced in both treatments when compared with placebo
      (chlorthalidone: 19.2+/-31.9min; diltiazem: 19.3+/-29.6min; placebo:
      46.1+/-55.3min; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In elderly hypertensive patients with
      coronary artery disease, chlorthalidone reduced myocardial ischemia similarly to 
      diltiazem. This result is consistent with epidemiological studies and suggests
      that reduction of arterial blood pressure with thiazide therapy plays an
      important role in decreasing myocardial ischemia.

TI  - Effects of fosinopril or sustained-release verapamil on blood pressure and serum 
      catecholamine concentrations in elderly hypertensive men.
PG  - 3-9
AB  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial showed 14 of 18
      (78%) of the elderly hypertensive men in this study had an uncomplicated and
      beneficial response to either fosinopril or verapamil. There was a well-tolerated
      reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DRP).
      There were no significant adverse drug events. Only the sitting SBP and the
      sitting DBP were significantly lowered by fosinopril and verapamil SR. Because
      reduction in both SBP and DBP in elderly hypertensives has been shown to be
      beneficial, these findings take on further importance when considering the choice
      of medication for antihypertensive therapy in the elderly. The increase in
      norepinephrine in the fosinopril-treated patients may explain why patients
      treated with long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone or in
      combination with diuretics rarely complain of orthostatic symptoms.

TI  - Increased dispersion and shortened refractoriness caused by verapamil in chronic 
      atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1403-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective was to assess the effect ofverapamil on atrial
      fibrillation (AF) cycle length and spatial dispersion of refractoriness in
      patients with chronic AF. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that
      verapamil prevents acute remodeling by AF. The effects of verapamil in chronic AF
      are unknown. METHODS: During electrophysiologic study in 15 patients with chronic
      AF (duration >1 year), 12 unipolar electrograms were recorded from right atrial
      free wall, right atrial appendage and coronary sinus, along with monophasic
      action potential recordings from the right atrial appendage. The mean
      fibrillatory interval at each atrial recording site was used as an index for
      local refractoriness. Dispersion of refractoriness was calculated as the standard
      deviation of all local mean fibrillatory intervals expressed as a percentage of
      the overall mean fibrillatory interval. After baseline measurements, verapamil
      (0.075 mg/kg intravenous in 10 min) was infused and the measurements were
      repeated. RESULTS: After administration ofverapamil, mean fibrillatory intervals 
      shortened by a mean of 16.6 +/- 3.3 ms (p < 0.001) at the right free wall, 15.0
      +/- 3.5 ms (p < 0.001) at the appendage and 17.1 +/- 3.2 ms (p < 0.01) in the
      coronary sinus. Monophasic action potential duration decreased by 15.9 +/- 4.0 ms
      (p < 0.01). Dispersion of refractoriness increased in all patients from 3.8 +/-
      0.8 to 5.1 +/- 1.8 (p < 0.001). A strong correlation between mean fibrillatory
      intervals and action potential duration was found, both before and after
      verapamil. CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil caused shortening of refractoriness and
      increase in spatial dispersion of refractoriness in patients with chronic AF.
      This implies that verapamil is not useful in reversing the remodeling process in 
      these patients.

TI  - Follow-up of renal function in treated and untreated older patients with isolated
      systolic hypertension. Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial
      Investigators.
PG  - 511-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the outcome trials that provided information on renal function in 
      older hypertensive patients, diuretics and beta-blockers were mostly used as
      first-line drugs. The long-term renal effects of calcium-channel blockers remain 
      unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the changes in renal function in 2,258 treated and
      2,148 untreated patients with isolated systolic hypertension, of whom 455 had
      diabetes mellitus and 390 had proteinuria. METHODS: We performed a post-hoc
      analysis of the double-blind placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe
      (Syst-Eur) Trial. Active treatment was initiated with nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day)
      with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide
      (12.5-25 mg/day), or both, titrated or combined to reduce the sitting systolic
      blood pressure by at least 20 mmHg, to less than 150 mmHg. The main outcome
      measures were serum creatinine concentration and creatinine clearance calculated 
      by the formula of Cockroft and Gault. RESULTS: Serum creatinine concentration at 
      the time when participants were randomly allocated to study groups was less than 
      176.8 micromol/l (2.0 mg/dl), averaging 88 micromol/l. At the time of the last
      serum creatinine measurement, the blood pressure difference (P< 0.001) between
      the two groups was 11.6/4.1 mmHg. In the intention-to-treat analysis (11,427
      patient-years), serum creatinine and the calculated creatinine clearance were not
      influenced by active treatment. However, in the patients assigned randomly to
      receive active treatment, the incidence of mild renal dysfunction (serum
      creatinine at least 176.8 mmol/l) decreased by 64% (P= 0.04) and that of
      proteinuria by 33% (P= 0.03). Active treatment reduced the risk of proteinuria
      more in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients: by 71%, compared with 20% (P=
      0.04). In non-proteinuric patients, active treatment did not influence serum
      creatinine, whereas in patients with proteinuria at entry to the study, serum
      creatinine decreased on active treatment (P< 0.001). Furthermore, in
      on-randomized treatment comparison stratified for risk at baseline, serum
      creatinine concentration did not change (P= 0.98) in patients continuing to
      receive monotherapy with nitrendipine, whereas it increased by 6.73 mmol/l (P <
      0.001) in patients who received hydrochlorothiazide alone or in combination with 
      other study medication (P < 0.001 for difference in trends). CONCLUSIONS: In
      older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive treatment
      starting with the dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, nitrendipine, did not 
      decrease blood pressure at the expense of renal function and prevented the
      development of proteinuria, especially in diabetic patients.

TI  - Long term effect of nifedipine GITS and lisinopril on subclinical organ damage in
      patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preventing subclinical organ damage is currently a major issue in the
      management of patients with essential hypertension. Antihypertensive drugs which 
      act through different pathophysiological mechanisms might confer specific target 
      organ protection beyond what is already provided by their blood pressure lowering
      effect. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with essential hypertension were randomized 
      to receive long-term treatment with either a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine 
      GITS, 90 mg/day) or an ACE-inhibitor (lisinopril, 20 mg/day). Blood pressure,
      left ventricular mass, carotid wall thickness and timed urinary albumin excretion
      were measured at baseline and over the course of 24 months of treatment. RESULTS:
      Both regimens significantly lowered mean blood pressure over the 24 months (from 
      124+/-2 to 103+/-2 mmHg in the lisinopril group and from 122+/-2 to 104+/-1 in
      the nifedipine group). Overall, end-organ damage improved with persistent blood
      pressure control. However, the two treatments had different specific effects.
      Lisinopril induced a more pronounced reduction of the left ventricular mass index
      (from 56+/-3 to 52+/-2 g/m2.7, P< 0.05) and urinary albumin excretion (from
      34+/-15 to 9+/-2 microg/min, P< 0.01), while nifedipine achieved a greater
      reduction of carotid intima plus media thickness (from 0.8+/-0.06 to 0.6+/-0.06
      mm, P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure control does help reduce the severity
      of organ damage in patients with essential hypertension. Different
      antihypertensive treatments may confer additional specific cardiorenal and
      vascular protection regardless of blood pressure control. These data could be
      useful when devising individualized therapeutic strategies in high-risk
      hypertensive patients.

TI  - Nifedipine and nimodipine competitively inhibit uridine kinase and
      orotidine-phosphate decarboxylase: theoretical relevance to poor outcome in
      stroke.
PG  - 237-41
AB  - Nifedipine and nimodipine, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, are commonly
      used as antihypertensive and antianginal agents in patients at risk for stroke.
      At least one stroke trial suggests that patients receiving calcium channel
      blockers at the time of an acute stroke have worse outcomes than those receiving 
      other or no antihypertensive medications. We hypothesize that the poor outcome
      may not be related to blood pressure changes but instead may be mediated by
      competitive inhibition of important enzymes of pyrimidine synthesis whose
      products are needed to repair nerve cell membranes after an acute stroke. Both
      drugs acted as competitive inhibitors of the only enzymes that are known to
      synthesize the nucleotide uridine-5'-phosphate: uridine kinase and
      orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase. Nifedipine produced Ki values of 28 microM 
      for uridine kinase and 105 microM for orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase.
      Nimodipine produced Ki values of 20 microM for uridine kinase and 18 microM for
      orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase. For uridine kinase, these inhibitors bound 
      more tightly than the physiologic substrates uridine or cytidine. For the
      decarboxylase, the inhibitors bound less tightly than the normal physiologic
      substrate orotidine-5'-phosphate. Additional experiments are needed to determine 
      whether the concentrations of nifedipine or nimodipine, and of cytidine, uridine,
      and orotidine-5'-phosphate in human brain, are such that this inhibition would
      affect stroke outcome.

TI  - The QT interval.
PG  - 1-45
AB  - The effects of disease states and therapeutic drugs on the QT interval have been 
      extensively studied in an attempt to understand the relationship between QT and
      the risk of torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death. Differences in heart
      rate correction methods, electrocardiogram lead placement, and other internal
      (eg, genetic, physiologic) and external (eg, food, time of day) factors have
      confounded the interpretation of this relationship. A comprehensive review of the
      epidemiologic literature suggests that the corrected QT interval (QTc) is an
      important but imprecise marker of cardiovascular disease. The association between
      QTc prolongation and mortality has been identified in patients with cardiac
      disease but is unclear in patients without cardiac disease. Drug-related
      prolongation of QTc can clearly increase the risk of torsade de pointes, but this
      arrhythmia is rarely associated with a QTc of less than 500 ms. It also appears
      that noncardiac drugs that are associated with QTc prolongation are not identical
      in their proarrhythmic capacities and that increased exposure via clinically
      significant drug interactions is a major contributor to the liability of
      noncardiac drug-induced arrhythmia. Recognition of the aforementioned variables
      in conjunction with careful QTc measurements assists in establishing a more
      precise benefit-risk ratio for a specific drug therapy or for arrhythmia risk
      associated with various pathophysiologic or genetic states.

TI  - Nicardipine versus nitroprusside for breakthrough hypertension following carotid 
      endarterectomy.
PG  - 16-9
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of nicardipine and nitroprusside
      for breakthrough hypertension following carotid endarterectomy. DESIGN:
      Prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled effectiveness trial. SETTING:
      University-based surgical intensive care unit. PATIENTS: 60 ASA physical status
      I, II, III, and IV patients experiencing breakthrough hypertension at the time of
      admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). INTERVENTIONS: Patients received
      either nicardipine (n = 29) and placebo or nitroprusside (n = 31) and placebo for
      up to 6 hours postoperatively. Loading doses of nicardipine were provided, but
      placebo was used as a load for patients randomized to nitroprusside. MEASUREMENTS
      AND MAIN RESULTS: Rapidity and variability of blood pressure (BP) control were
      assessed. During the first 10 minutes, 83% of nicardipine patients compared to
      23% of nitroprusside-treated patients, achieved BP control (p < 0.01). Following 
      initial control, 12 nicardipine- and 24 nitroprusside-treated patients required
      additional titration of their infusions to maintain blood pressure within the
      targeted range (p < 0.05). No patient suffered a stroke, myocardial infarction,
      or was returned to the operating room (OR) for bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Nicardipine
      administration produced more rapid BP control, most likely related to the
      administration of a loading dose. In addition to more rapid control,
      nicardipine-treated patients had less variability in BP and required
      significantly fewer additional interventions. Although no patient suffered a
      major event during this study, this study was not powered sufficiently to assess 
      safety.

      systemic hypertension. Comparison of Candesartan and Amlodipine for Safety,
      Tolerability and Efficacy (CASTLE) Study Investigators.
PG  - 727-31
AB  - The comparative antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of the angiotensin II 
      receptor blocker candesartan cilexetil and the calcium channel blocker amlodipine
      were evaluated in an 8-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
      parallel-group, forced-titration study in 251 adult patients (45% women, 16%
      black) with mild hypertension (stage 1). Following a 4- to 5-week placebo run-in 
      period, patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 90 to 99 mm Hg
      received candesartan cilexetil 16 mg (n = 123) or amlodipine 5 mg (n = 128) once 
      daily. After 4 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients were uptitrated to
      candesartan cilexetil 32 mg or amlodipine 10 mg once daily. There were no
      significant differences between the candesartan cilexetil and amlodipine regimens
      for reducing BP; mean systolic BP/diastolic BP reductions were -15.2/-10.2 mm Hg 
      versus -15.4/-11.3 mm Hg, respectively (p = 0.88/0.25). Overall, 79% of patients 
      on candesartan cilexetil and 87% of those on amlodipine were controlled
      (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg). A total of 3.3% of patients on candesartan cilexetil
      discontinued treatment, compared with 9.4% of patients on amlodipine, including
      2.4% versus 4.7% for adverse events and 0% versus 1.6% for peripheral edema,
      respectively. Peripheral edema, the prespecified primary tolerability end point, 
      occurred with significantly greater frequency in patients on amlodipine (22.1%;
      mild 8.7%, moderate 11.8%, severe 1.6%) versus patients on candesartan cilexetil 
      (8.9%; mild 8.1%, moderate 0.8%) (p = 0.005). Candesartan cilexetil and
      amlodipine are both highly effective in controlling BP in patients with mild
      hypertension. Candesartan cilexetil offers a significant tolerability advantage
      with respect to less risk of developing peripheral edema.

TI  - [Comparative study of spirapril (quadropril) and amlodipine efficacy. Results of 
      randomized trial in patients with mild to moderate arterial hypertension].
PG  - 86-9
AB  - AIM: To compare in the non-blind randomised parallel study the efficiency of
      quadropril and amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate arterial
      hypertension. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 80 patients (57.6 +/- 1.0 years)
      were included in this study. The patients were randomised in two groups, 40
      patients each. Patients of group 1 received monotherapy with quadropril, while
      those of group 2 were treated with amlodipine. The treatment duration was 8 weeks
      in both groups. Quadropril was given in a fixed dose of 6 mg once daily. The
      initial dose of amlodipine was 5 mg/day. In case of insufficient effect the dose 
      was elevated to 10 mg/day. The efficacy was evaluated by changes in blood
      pressure (BP) measured at rest. Moreover, in 50 randomly chosen patients 24-h
      monitoring of BP was performed at the start and end of the treatment. RESULTS: In
      the quadropril group baseline systolic BP reached 158.6 +/- 2.1 mm Hg, diastolic 
      BP--101.8 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, heart rate was 74.3 +/- 1.6 beats/min. In the amlodipine
      group baseline systolic BP was 159.9 +/- 2.4 mm Hg, diastolic BP--101.8 +/- 1.0
      mm Hg, heart rate was 71.3 +/- 1.0 beats/min. Systolic BP decreased at the end of
      quadropril therapy to 138.5 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, diastolic BP to 88.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg. No
      significant change of the heart rate was observed. Under 5 mg of amlodipine
      systolic BP decreased to 137.9 +/- 2.5 mm Hg and diastolic BP to 87.1 +/- 1.6 mm 
      Hg. Heart rate increased to 73.3 +/- 2.2 beats/min. Under therapy with 10 mg
      amlodipine systolic BP decreased to 145.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg, diastolic BP to 89.7 +/-
      3.4 mm Hg. Heart rate increased to 77.3 +/- 4.0 beats/min (p < 0.01). The
      hypotensive effect of quadropril remained stable while the effect of amlodipine
      decreased by the 8th week of therapy (p < 0.01). Side effects were observed
      significantly more often in the amlodipine group, then in the quadropril group.
      The main quadropril side effect was cough. Side effects observed in the
      amlodipine group were edemas, tachycardia, weakness. CONCLUSION: Both quadropril 
      and amlodipine demonstrated a comparable antihypertensive effect although in 11
      of 40 patients in the amlodipine group a dose increase was necessary and
      tolerability of quadropril was better.

TI  - Cardiogenic shock following a single therapeutic oral dose of verapamil.
PG  - 69-70
AB  - Cardiogenic shock and apnoea appeared in a 78-year-old woman with a history of
      biventricular heart failure, following ingestion of a single 80 mg verapamil
      tablet. She was resuscitated with artificial ventilation, dobutamine,
      norepinephrine and calcium gluconate. Toxicological analysis revealed
      unexpectedly high plasma verapamil concentration, which was attributed to the
      patient's liver failure. In patients with advanced heart failure a single oral
      therapeutic dose of verapamil may have a severe toxic effect.

TI  - Verapamil SR and trandolapril combination therapy is safe and effective in
      hypertensive patients with metabolic disorders.
PG  - 5-9
AB  - Verapamil SR (180 mg) plus trandolapril (2 mg) is a potent antihypertensive
      combination but the efficacy and safety of this treatment has not been studied
      fully in hypertensive patients with metabolic disorders. We enrolled 298 patients
      with mild to moderate hypertension who had at least one of the following
      disorders: diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia or mild renal failure. The
      sitting systolic pressure and diastolic blood pressures were significantly
      decreased after 12 weeks of treatment. Blood pressure was inadequately controlled
      in only 24 patients (8.8%). Progressive decreases in blood glucose, total
      cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels were observed during
      the study. There was no significant change in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and
      transaminase levels (p > 0.05). There was a significant decrease in
      microalbuminuria levels. There was no significant change in glycosylated
      haemoglobin levels in diabetic patients. Verapamil SR plus trandolapril is an
      effective drug combination in the treatment of hypertension. It may be used
      safely in patients with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and mild renal
      failure.

TI  - Long-term effects of amlodipine and lisinopril on left ventricular mass and
      diastolic function in elderly, previously untreated hypertensive patients: the
      ELVERA trial.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of a calcium antagonist (amlodipine) and an
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) on left ventricular mass and
      diastolic function in elderly, previously untreated hypertensives. DESIGN: A
      double-blind randomized parallel group trial. Effects of amlodipine and
      lisinopril on left ventricular mass and diastolic function (E/A Ratio) (The
      ELVERA trial). SETTING: Rural northern Netherlands: population screening new
      diagnosed hypertensive subjects. PATIENTS: The study population comprised 166
      newly diagnosed hypertensive (aged 60-75) with diastolic blood pressure between
      95-115 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure between 160-220 mmHg. INTERVENTION:
      Patients were randomly allocated to receive 5-10 mg amlodipine or 10-20 mg
      lisinopril for 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prior and after 1 and 2 years of
      treatment left ventricular mass, indexed by body surface (LVMI) was estimated by 
      2-D mode echocardiography according to Devereux with use of Penn convention.
      Early to atrial filling ratio (E/A) was assessed by transmitral flow. Change from
      baseline of LVMI and E/A ratio was evaluated by repeated measurement analysis of 
      the treatment effect in an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: Both amlodipine 
      and lisinopril led to equivalent reduction in systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure. At the end of the study the amlodipine group led to LVMI decrease by
      21.8 g/m < or = [95% confidence interval (CI), 18.3-25.3] and E/A ratio increased
      by 0.08 (95% CI, 0.05-0.11). In the lisinopril group LVMI decreased by 22.4 g/m <
      or = (95%, CI, 19.0-25.8) and E/A ratio increased by 0.07 (95% CI, 0.04-0.10). No
      statistically significant differences were found in changes in LVMI and E/A ratio
      between amlodipine and lisinopril. CONCLUSION: A long-term study, the ELVERA
      trial proves that amlodipine and lisinopril reduce left ventricular mass and
      improve diastolic function to a similar extent in elderly newly diagnosed
      hypertensive patients.

TI  - Which fasting triglyceride levels best reflect coronary risk? Evidence from the
      Turkish Adult Risk Factor Study.
PG  - 9-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Association between raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL-C) levels and high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) is well established
      and taken into account in guidelines on coronary prevention. HYPOTHESIS: The
      relationship between risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and the levels of
      fasting plasma triglycerides was studied in the cohort of the Turkish Adult Risk 
      Factor Study, a representative random sample of an adult population. METHODS: In 
      829 men and 907 women aged > or =27 years (mean 48.5+/-11), plasma lipids and
      lipoproteins were measured by the enzymatic dry method in the postabsorptive
      state. A sample of values was validated in a reference laboratory. Apoliprotein
      (apo) A-I and B were measured by the turbidimetric immunoassay using commercial
      kits in part of the cohort. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were
      made. Criteria for the diagnosis of CHD were based on history, cardiovascular
      examination, and Minnesota coding of resting electrocardiograms. Coronary heart
      disease was diagnosed in about 7% of the subjects. Participants were divided into
      four categories depending on their triglyceride levels: I = < 100 mg/dl (282 men,
      400 women), II = 100-139 mg/dl (204 men, 228 women), III = 140-212 mg/dl (188
      men, 180 women), and IV = > or = 212 mg/dl (155 men, 99 women). RESULTS: After
      adjustment for age, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) cholesterol, smoking, and body mass index by logistic regression analysis, 
      and after assigning the CHD risk of 1 to Category I, the relative risk for men
      and women combined rose to 1.42 in Category III (p<0.045) while it diminished to 
      0.94 in Category IV (p = 0.79). In women, the odds ratio (OR) rose gradually up
      to 1.78 (p< 0.025) in Category III, only to decline in Category IV. The OR in men
      was slightly, insignificantly, and equally elevated in Categories III and IV.
      Patients with CHD in Category III were not distinguished from those in Category
      IV by the studied risk parameters. It was suggested that high risk for
      CHD--particularly in subjects with slightly elevated or normal cholesterol
      levels-is often not reflected by extreme increases of fasting triglycerides but
      best by modest elevations (140-212 mg/dl), which serve better as a marker of
      triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles. This knowledge may prove to be of value 
      in population screening and individual risk assessment.

TI  - Verapamil increases the survival of patients with anthracycline-resistant
      metastatic breast carcinoma.
PG  - 1471-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Verapamil (VER), a potent calcium channel blocker, has been found to 
      overcome P-gp-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR) and to increase sensitivity to
      cytotoxic anticancer drugs in refractory myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The
      value of VER for treating solid tumors is still a matter for debate. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: We performed a prospective study in 99 patients with
      anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast carcinoma (MBC), to assess the clinical
      effect of oral VER given in association with chemotherapy. Instead of retreating 
      patients with anthracycline, we used a partially noncross-resistant regimen (VF),
      combining vindesine (VDS) and 5-fluorouracil given as a continuous infusion (5-FU
      CI). Patients were randomly assigned to two cohorts. One cohort (47 patients) was
      treated in 28-day cycles, each involving the administration of VDS (3 mg/m2 i.v. 
      bolus on days 1 and 10) and 5-FU CI, (400 mg/m2/day i.v. from day 1 to day 10).
      The other cohort (52 patients) received the same VDS and 5-FU treatment and an
      additional oral VER treatment (240 mg/day divided in 2 doses), from day 1 to day 
      28 of each cycle. Patients were treated until progression. RESULTS: The treatment
      was well tolerated and no side effects that could be attributed to VER were
      detected. Patients treated with VER had longer overall survival (OS) (median OS: 
      323 vs. 209 days, P = 0.036) and a higher response rate (27% vs. 11%, P = 0.04)
      than those not given VER. Progression-free survival (PFS) was also longer but the
      difference was not statistically significant (median PFS: 4.6 and 2.7 months for 
      the VER and non-VER groups respectively, P = 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: This clinical
      trial demonstrates that a chemosensitizer, such as VER, can increase the survival
      of MBC patients with acquired anthracycline resistance.

TI  - Patterns of amlodipine and felodipine use in an elderly Quebec population.
PG  - 1109-17
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess drug prescription patterns and medical resource consumption
      in an elderly population in Quebec receiving amlodipine or felodipine for the
      treatment of hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sociodemographic, clinical and
      drug claim data for a random sample of hypertensive patients 65 years of age and 
      older with at least one claim for amlodipine or felodipine between August 1, 1990
      and August 31, 1997 were extracted from the Regie de l'assurance maladie du
      Quebec (RAMQ) database. Patterns of prescription renewal, drug switch and
      compliance rates, and health care resource use were established for both an
      amlodipine and a felodipine group. Long term persistence on treatment was
      quantified by survival curve analysis. RESULTS: The amlodipine (5188 patients)
      and felodipine (2630 patients) groups were similar in terms of sex ratio (66.7%
      female) and age (mean 74 years). Average compliance rates for amlodipine patients
      (67.9%) were significantly higher than for felodipine patients (66.2%) (P<0.01), 
      and switch rates were 5.4-fold higher in the latter group. Patients initiating
      treatment with felodipine had a 27% increased rate of discontinuation (relative
      risk 1.27) compared with the amlodipine patients. In addition, patients with at
      least one year of follow-up data were more likely to maintain amlodipine as part 
      of their antihypertensive regimens than felodipine. After adjustment, medical
      resource consumption patterns were similar for both groups except for an increase
      in the number of specialist visits for the amlodipine treatment group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received amlodipine, either as a monotherapy or as part
      of a multitherapy regimen, were more compliant and persistent with their
      treatment than patients on felodipine. The data suggest that amlodipine may
      provide more effective long term hypertension control than felodipine, and that
      the two drugs are not therapeutically equivalent.

TI  - Response to antihypertensive therapy in older patients with sustained and
      nonsustained systolic hypertension. Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur)
      Trial Investigators.
PG  - 1139-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of the present study was to assess the effect of
      antihypertensive therapy on clinic (CBP) and ambulatory (ABP) blood pressures, on
      ECG voltages, and on the incidence of stroke and cardiovascular events in older
      patients with sustained and nonsustained systolic hypertension. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Patients who were >/=60 years old, with systolic CBP of 160 to 219 mm Hg
      and diastolic CBP of <95 mm Hg, were randomized into the double-blind
      placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial. Treatment
      consisted of nitrendipine, with the possible addition of enalapril,
      hydrochlorothiazide, or both. Patients enrolled in the Ambulatory Blood Pressure 
      Monitoring Side Project were classified according to daytime systolic ABP into 1 
      of 3 subgroups: nonsustained hypertension (<140 mm Hg), mild sustained
      hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg), and moderate sustained hypertension (>/=160 mm
      Hg). At baseline, patients with nonsustained hypertension had smaller ECG
      voltages (P<0.001) and, during follow-up, a lower incidence of stroke (P<0.05)
      and of cardiovascular complications (P=0.01) than other groups. Active treatment 
      reduced ABP and CBP in patients with sustained hypertension but only CBP in
      patients with nonsustained hypertension (P<0.001). The influence of active
      treatment on ECG voltages (P<0.05) and on the incidence of stroke (P<0.05) and
      cardiovascular events (P=0.06) was more favorable than that of placebo only in
      patients with moderate sustained hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      sustained hypertension had higher ECG voltages and rates of cardiovascular
      complications than did patients with nonsustained hypertension. The favorable
      effects of active treatment on these outcomes were only statistically significant
      in patients with moderate sustained hypertension.

PG  - 283-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-hypertensive effect of verapamil COER-24 180/240 
      mg in a single dose at bedtime as single therapy in mild to moderate
      hypertensives. METHODS: A multicentric, open, placebo controlled study of 81
      hypertensive patients older than 20 years-old followed to 8 weeks. Blood pressure
      was measured in doctor's office and by 24 h ambulatory monitoring (ABPM).
      RESULTS: We observed a decreased in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in
      doctor's office at 4th and 8th weeks. ABPM showed that both systolic, diastolic
      and mean blood pressure, heart rate and the mean 24-hour blood pressure load
      decreased after the 8-week treatment. In addition, there was a reduction of the
      double-product, especially in the morning and 68% of the patients didn't have any
      adverse events. CONCLUSION: The therapy verapamil COER-24 180/240 mg in a single 
      dose is useful for mild and moderate hypertensive patients, with significant
      pressure decrease in both office blood pressure measurements and in the ABPM/24
      hours, as well as showing good tolerability.

TI  - Extended-release nifedipine bezoar identified one year after discontinuation.
PG  - 862-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of tablet impaction of nifedipine extended-release
      tablets (Procardia XL) discovered one year after discontinuation of the drug in a
      patient with peptic stricture. DATA SOURCES: English-language references
      identified via a MEDLINE search from 1966 through September 1998 and
      bibliographic review of pertinent articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Extended-release
      nifedipine has been associated with the formation of medication bezoars in case
      reports. Bezoars are concretions of undigested material within the
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although they can occur throughout the GI tract,
      bezoars are most frequently located in the stomach and, rarely, in the duodenum. 
      We report an unusual case of tablet impaction with a gastric outlet obstruction
      in the duodenal area discovered one year after the patient stopped taking
      extended-release nifedipine. CONCLUSIONS: Extended-release nifedipine is
      associated with tablet impaction, even long after discontinuing administration.
      Although rare, clinicians should be aware of this potential problem when
      prescribing extended-release medications to patients at risk, and should consider
      this possible etiology when refractory epigastric pain and weight loss occur.

PG  - 232-7
AB  - In this review we attempt to determine the role of calcium channel blockers in
      preventing cardiovascular sequela in patients with both hypertension and diabetes
      mellitus. The data have been collected from three sources: post hoc analyses of
      subgroups of diabetic patients in placebo-controlled hypertension trials (SHEP,
      Syst-Eur, Syst-China); a stepped care blood pressure oriented trial (HOT); and
      comparative trials primarily focussing on metabolic aspects and intermediate
      endpoints (ABCD, FACET). On balance, the data seem to indicate that long-acting
      calcium channel blockers score remarkably well in preventing cardiovascular
      complications in diabetic hypertensive patients.

TI  - Effect of enalapril and nifedipine on orthostatic hypotension in older
      hypertensive patients.
PG  - 807-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of enalapril with long-acting nifedipine on
      orthostatic hypotension in older patients. DESIGN: A prospective, double blinded,
      cross-over study. SETTING: The outpatient clinic of a university hospital.
      PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-nine patients aged 65 years or older with systolic blood
      pressure (SBP) of 140-190 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90-110 mm
      Hg. INTERVENTION: Enalapril 5-20 mg od or nifedipine 30-90 mg od for 8 weeks,
      followed by 4 weeks washout and cross-over for a second 8-week period.
      MEASUREMENTS: Supine and standing 0-, 1-, and 5-minutes blood pressure was
      recorded before and at the end of each treatment period. RESULTS: At baseline,
      SBP was 158.8 +/- 8.7 mm Hg, and DBP was 97.1 +/- 5.9 mm Hg. There was a decline 
      in SBP of 6.1 +/- 2.7 mm Hg and 8.4 +/- 4.1 mm Hg after 1 and 5 minutes of
      standing, respectively. Both agents caused a significant decline in supine blood 
      pressure. Enalapril: supine SBP 158.8 +/- 8.7 to 143 +/- 7.3 mm Hg; supine DBP
      97.1 +/- 5.9 to 85.1 +/- 5.1 mm Hg (P = .0001). The drop in SBP after standing
      for 5 minutes was only 2.4 +/- 1.6 mm Hg with no change in diastolic values. A > 
      or = 10 mm Hg drop in SBP was observed in only three patients, and no patient
      experienced a decline of 20 mm Hg or more. Nifedipine: supine SBP: 160.3 +/- 9 to
      145.3 +/- 8.1 mm Hg; supine DBP: 96.3 +/- 5.7 to 86.3 +/- 5.8 (P = .0001).
      Nifedipine induced an orthostatic decline in SBP values; there was an 8.7 +/- 4.8
      mm Hg difference between supine and 5 minutes standing values (P = .0005) without
      change in diastolic values. An orthostatic decline in SBP of > or = 10 mm Hg
      occurred in 13 patients, and there was a drop of > or = 20 mm Hg in six patients.
      The cross-over of enalapril and nifedipine reproduced the hypotensive effect and 
      reversed the postural effect. (P = .0002 nifedipine vs enalapril) CONCLUSIONS:
      Enalapril and nifedipine were equipotent in reducing supine blood pressure
      levels. Enalapril also reduced the number of orthostatic episodes significantly, 
      whereas nifedipine aggravated this phenomenon.

TI  - [A study of the tolerability and effectiveness of nicardipine retard in cognitive
      deterioration of vascular origin].
PG  - 719-28
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nicardipine is a calcium antagonist which in previous trials has
      been shown to be effective in the prevention of stroke and the treatment of its
      sequelae, such as cognitive deterioration of vascular origin. We consider a phase
      IV study at primary care level to analyze the tolerability and efficacy of a
      retarded action formulation of 40 mg nicardipine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this
      open, prospective, multicentric trial 6,375 patients took part, of whom 5,593
      were evaluated (87.7%). All were diagnosed as having vascular-type dementia
      (Hachinski > 6) and were given treatment with nicardipine retard (40 mg/day/6
      months). The patients were assessed on the Montorio (daily activity) and SPMSQ
      (cognitive function) scales at the first visit and after one, three and six
      months, together with a record of side effects. RESULTS: Only 0.9% of the
      patients recruited abandoned the study for problems of tolerability of the drug. 
      The average improvement seen on Montorio's test was statistically significant
      from the first month, and reached 9% after six months. The 65.5% of the patients 
      who started the study in seriously deteriorated condition showed improvement
      after six months. For the SPMSQ test, the average improvement was also
      statistically significant from the first visit and over 40% after six months.
      There was improvement in 64.4% of the patients who were severely deteriorated at 
      the start of the study. CONCLUSION: Nicardipine retard is a drug which is safe
      and effective when used for the treatment of mental deterioration of vascular
      origin.

TI  - Antihypertensive drugs and the risk of idiopathic aplastic anaemia.
PG  - 604-8
AB  - AIMS: A recent report has raised concern that nifedipine may be associated with
      an increased risk of aplastic anaemia. This large population-based study
      evaluated the risk of idiopathic aplastic anaemia in users of calcium channel
      blockers compared with that of other antihypertensive drugs. METHODS: The study
      was based on information derived from the General Practice Research Database. We 
      conducted a follow-up study with a nested case-control analysis of 322 448
      subjects who received antihypertensive drugs. Cases were people who had a
      first-time diagnosis of aplastic anaemia during January 1, 1988 through September
      30, 1997. The risk estimate of aplastic anaemia was calculated for all
      antihypertensive drugs. For the nested case-control analysis, six controls were
      matched to each case on age, sex and general practice attended. Odds ratios
      compared the risk of idiopathic aplastic anaemia for all antihypertensive drugs
      relative to nonusers. RESULTS: There were 13 cases of newly diagnosed idiopathic 
      aplastic anaemia. The estimated risk of aplastic anaemia per 100 000 users was
      0.8 (95% CI 0.1, 4.7) for calcium channel blockers, 1.4 (95% CI 0.5, 4.1) for
      beta-adrenoceptor blockers, 2.3 (95% CI 0.6, 8.6) for angiotension-converting
      enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 5.9 (95% CI 1.6, 21.5) for users of other
      antihypertensive drugs. In the case-control analysis of 13 cases and 77 controls,
      the odds ratio was 0.3 (95% CI 0.02, 3.3) for calcium channel blockers, 0.5 (95% 
      CI 0.1, 2.5) for beta-adrenoceptor blockers, 0.7 (95% CI 0.1, 5.6) for ACE
      inhibitors, 1.2 (95% CI 0.1, 11.8) for users of other antihypertensive drugs and 
      0.7 (95% CI 0.1, 7.2) for users of multiple drugs with a calcium channel blocker 
      compared with nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the use of
      calcium channel blockers is not associated with an increased risk of aplastic
      anaemia.

TI  - Diltiazem in acute myocardial infarction treated with thrombolytic agents: a
      randomised placebo-controlled trial. Incomplete Infarction Trial of European
      Research Collaborators Evaluating Prognosis post-Thrombolysis (INTERCEPT)
PG  - 1751-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diltiazem reduces non-fatal reinfarction and refractory ischaemia
      after non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, an acute coronary syndrome similar to the
      incomplete infarction that occurs after successful reperfusion. We postulated
      that this agent would reduce cardiac events in patients after acute myocardial
      infarction treated initially with thrombolytic agents-a clinical application
      previously unexplored with heart-rate-lowering calcium antagonists. METHODS: A
      prospective, randomised, double-blind, sequential trial was done in 874 patients 
      with acute myocardial infarction, but without congestive heart failure, who first
      received thrombolytic agents. Patients received either 300 mg oral diltiazem once
      daily, or placebo, initiated within 36-96 h of infarct onset, and given for up to
      6 months. The trial primary endpoint was the cumulative first event rate of
      cardiac death, non-fatal reinfarction, or refractory ischaemia. Additional
      prespecified endpoints included several composites of non-fatal cardiac events
      (non-fatal reinfarction combined with refractory ischaemia, all recurrent
      ischaemia, or the need for myocardial revascularisation). The diagnosis of
      ischaemia, whether refractory or recurrent, and the need for myocardial
      revascularisation, was always based on objective electrocardiographical evidence 
      of ischaemia, either at rest or on exertion. RESULTS: For the trial primary
      endpoint, 131 events occurred in the 444 placebo patients and 97 events in the
      430 diltiazem patients (hazard ratio 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02; p=0.07). For
      non-fatal cardiac events, diltiazem treatment was associated with a relative
      decrease (0.76; 0.58-1.00) in the combined event rate of non-fatal reinfarction
      and refractory ischaemia. There was a similar decrease in the composite non-fatal
      endpoints of non-fatal reinfarction combined with all recurrent ischaemia (0.80; 
      0.64-1.00) and non-fatal reinfarction combined with the need for myocardial
      revascularisation (0.67; 0.46-0.96). The need for myocardial revascularisation
      alone was significantly reduced by 42% (0.61; 0.39-0.96). No major safety issues 
      were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: Diltiazem did not reduce the cumulative occurrence
      of cardiac death, non-fatal reinfarction, or refractory ischaemia during a
      6-month follow-up, but did reduce all composite endpoints of non-fatal cardiac
      events, especially the need for myocardial revascularisation.

TI  - Medical therapy, symptoms, and the distress the cause: relation to quality of
      life in patients with angina pectoris and/or hypertension.
PG  - 1477-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse events during drug therapy can be assessed through
      measurement of 2 features: their frequency and their severity. Their severity, in
      turn, can be measured by assessing the distress that they cause. Our goal was to 
      relate the magnitude of the distress induced by treatment with calcium-channel
      blocking agents to the change in quality of life assessed through psychosocial
      instruments in patients treated with calcium-channel blocking agents, either for 
      hypertension or for angina pectoris. METHODS: Four hundred seventy-five patients 
      with angina pectoris were randomized to double-blind treatment with PPR
      (physiological pattern release) verapamil hydrochloride, amlodipine besylate,
      amlodipineatenolol combination, or placebo. In addition, 557 hypertensive
      patients were randomized either to PPR verapamil or nifedipine GITS
      (gastrointestinal system). Both studies were double-blind. RESULTS: Significant
      differences in treatment of angina pectoris or hypertension, were not found
      between the regimens. Overall quality of life also failed to show a significant
      difference in either group. In both groups, however, remarkable concordance was
      found between the degree of distress associated with specific symptoms and a
      change in quality of life. An unchanged, stable symptom distress was associated
      with a significant improvement in the quality of life of about 0.1 SD.
      Improvement or erosion of symptom distress represented by 1 step was associated
      with a 0.1- to 0.2-SD change. The extreme change in symptom distress was
      associated with a substantially larger change in global quality of life.
      CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of symptom distress or relief associated with symptoms
      in 2 patient populations correlated strongly with a shift in quality of life. The
      assessment of distress associated with symptoms provides valuable additional
      information on drug therapy.

TI  - Prognostic implications of results from exercise testing in patients with chronic
      stable angina pectoris treated with metoprolol or verapamil. A report from the
      Angina Prognosis Study In Stockholm (APSIS).
PG  - 901-10
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the prognostic implications of results from exercise testing,
      and of antianginal treatment among patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Out of 809 patients in the Angina Prognosis Study In
      Stockholm (APSIS), 731 (511 men) performed evaluable exercise tests before and
      after 1 month on double-blind treatment with metoprolol or verapamil. During a
      median follow-up of 40 months, 32 patients suffered a cardiovascular death and 29
      a non-fatal myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Prognostic implications of results
      from exercise tests were assessed in a multivariate Cox model which included sex,
      previous myocardial infarction, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Maximal
      ST-segment depression, especially if >/=2 mm and occurring after exercise, as
      well as exercise duration independently predicted cardiovascular death. Similar
      results were obtained for the combined end-point of cardiovascular
      death+myocardial infarction. Among patients with a positive exercise test at
      baseline, verapamil reduced the maximal ST-depression more markedly than
      metoprolol (P<0. 01). However, when the treatment given and treatment effects on 
      ST-segment depression were added to the Cox model, no impact on prognosis could
      be detected for either cardiovascular death alone or combined with myocardial
      infarction. Anginal pain carried no prognostic information. CONCLUSION: Marked
      ST-segment depression during and after exercise, and a low exercise capacity
      independently predicted an adverse outcome in patients with stable angina
      pectoris, whereas anginal symptoms had no predictive value. Short-term treatment 
      effects on ischaemia did not seem to influence prognosis. Post-exercise ischaemia
      should be examined carefully when evaluating patients with stable angina
      pectoris.

TI  - Restenosis and clinical outcome in patients treated with amlodipine after
      angioplasty: results from the Coronary AngioPlasty Amlodipine REStenosis Study
      (CAPARES).
PG  - 592-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our intent was to investigate the effect of the dihydropyridine
      calcium channel blocker amlodipine on restenosis and clinical outcome in patients
      undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). BACKGROUND:
      Amlodipine has sustained vasodilatory effects and relieves coronary spasm, which 
      may reduce luminal loss and clinical complications after PTCA. METHODS: In a
      prospective, double-blind design, 635 patients were randomized to 10 mg of
      amlodipine or placebo. Pretreatment with the study drug started two weeks before 
      PTCA and continued until four months after PTCA. The primary angiographic end
      point was loss in minimal lumen diameter (MLD) from post-PTCA to follow-up, as
      assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Clinical end points were
      death, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery and repeat
      PTCA (major adverse clinical events). RESULTS: Angioplasty was performed in 585
      patients (92.1%); 91 patients (15.6%) had coronary stents implanted. Follow-up
      angiography suitable for QCA analysis was done in 236 patients in the amlodipine 
      group and 215 patients in the placebo group (per-protocol group). The mean loss
      in MLD was 0.30 +/- 0.45 mm in the amlodipine group versus 0.29 +/- 0.49 mm in
      the placebo group (p = 0.84). The need for repeat PTCA was significantly lower in
      the amlodipine versus the placebo group (10 [3.1%] vs. 23 patients [7.3%], p =
      0.02, relative risk ratio [RR]: 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22 to
      0.91), and the composite incidence of clinical events (30 [9.4%] vs. 46 patients 
      (14.5%), p = 0.049, RR: 0.65, CI: 0.43 to 0.99) within the four months follow-up 
      period (intention-to-treat analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Amlodipine therapy starting
      two weeks before PTCA did not reduce luminal loss, but the incidence of repeat
      PTCA and the composite major adverse clinical events were significantly reduced
      during the four-month follow-up period after PTCA with amlodipine as compared
      with placebo.

TI  - [The hemodynamic effects of lomir and adalat in patients with postoperative
      arterial hypertension].
PG  - 63-6
AB  - Comparison of the hypotensive effects of lomir (isradipine) and adalat
      (nifedipine) in 36 patients showed lomir to be more effective after aortocoronary
      bypass surgery. Normalization of arterial pressure started 5-10 min after lomir
      infusion, followed by a 24.5% increase in cardiac output and decrease in
      peripheral vascular resistance by 43.8%. Arterial pressure did not rise after
      lomir infusion was discontinued. With adalat, arterial pressure normalized 30 min
      later, and the therapeutic effect was achieved with a very high dose (5-7 times
      higher than recommended). Cardiac output did not change, and cardiac arrhythmias 
      were observed in 11.7% patients. Therefore, lomir is a preferable Ca channel
      blocker for treating postoperative arterial hypertension after aortocoronary
      bypass surgery.

TI  - Initiation of atrial fibrillation by ectopic beats originating from the pulmonary
      veins: electrophysiological characteristics, pharmacological responses, and
      effects of radiofrequency ablation.
PG  - 1879-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be initiated by ectopic beats
      originating from the atrial or great venous tissues. This study investigated the 
      anatomic characteristics and electrophysiological properties of pulmonary veins
      (PVs), as well as the possible mechanisms and response to drugs of ectopic foci, 
      and assessed the effects of radiofrequency (RF) ablation on AF initiated by
      ectopic beats originating from PVs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients
      with frequent episodes of paroxysmal AF and 10 control patients were included.
      Distal PVs showed the shortest effective refractory periods (ERPs), and right
      superior PVs showed a higher incidence of intra-PV conduction block than left
      superior PVs. Superior and left PVs had longer myocardial sleeves than inferior
      and right PVs, respectively. These electrophysiological characteristics were
      similar between AF and control patients. Propranolol, verapamil, and procainamide
      suppressed ectopic beats that originated from the PVs. Of 116 ectopic foci that
      initiated AF, 103 (88.8%) originated from PVs. A mean of 7+/-3 RF applications
      completely eliminated 110 ectopic foci (94.8%). During the 6+/-2-month follow-up 
      period, 68 patients (86. 1%) were free of AF without any antiarrhythmic drugs.
      Follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram showed 42.4% of ablated PVs had focal
      stenosis. One patient had mild exertional dyspnea after ablation, but it resolved
      3 months later; 1 patient had onset of mild exertional dyspnea 5 months after
      ablation. CONCLUSIONS: Electrophysiological characteristics of PVs are different 
      from those in the atria. Ectopic beats from PVs can initiate AF, and
      beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, calcium channel blockers, and sodium channel
      blockers can suppress these ectopic beats. Careful mapping and elimination of
      these ectopic foci can cure paroxysmal AF.

TI  - Combination of calcium channel blockers and beta blockers for patients with
      exercise-induced angina pectoris: a double-blind parallel-group comparison of
      different classes of calcium channel blockers. The Netherlands Working Group on
      Cardiovascular Research (WCN).
PG  - 447-54
AB  - The combination of calcium channel blockers and beta blockers is more effective
      for the treatment of exercise-induced angina pectoris than beta blocker
      monotherapy. Since ischemia in exercise-induced angina is essentially preceded by
      an increase in heart rate, calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic
      property may perform better for this purpose than nonchronotropic compounds. A
      335-patient, 10-week, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of amlodipine 5 and
      10 mg, diltiazem XR 200 and 300 mg, and mibefradil 50 and 100 mg treatment added 
      to baseline beta blocker treatment was performed. Exercise testing (ETT) was
      performed by bicycle ergometry. Although none of the calcium channel blockers
      improved duration of exercise or amount of workload, all of them significantly
      delayed onset of 1 mm ST segment depression on ETT (p<0.001 for any treatment
      versus baseline). In addition, mibefradil, both low- and high-dose treatment,
      produced the largest delays (low dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by
      24.1 and 29.8 s, p<0.003 and <0.001, respectively; high dose: different from
      diltiazem and amlodipine by 33.7 and 37.0 s, p<0.001 and <0.001, respectively).
      These effects were linearly correlated to the amount of rate pressure product
      (RPP) reduction. Serious symptoms of dizziness likewise occurred significantly
      more frequently with mibefradil (p<0.05) and led 19 patients taking mibefradil to
      withdraw from the trial. The authors conclude that calcium channel blockers with 
      negative chronotropic property provide better delay of ischemia in patients with 
      exercise-induced angina but that the concomitant risk of intolerable dizziness
      largely reduces this benefit.

      onset. Goals and design of the SOPAT Study. Executive committee of the
      investigators representing trial physicians].
PG  - 185-94
AB  - The indication to treat symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is discussed
      controversely. Successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of
      symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events.
      However, several antiarrhythmic drugs are also known to increase the risk of
      proarrhythmic events. A randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled
      multicenter trial with 1000 patients to be recruited was designed to compare the 
      effects of two antiarrhythmic drugs frequently used in Germany for the treatment 
      of atrial fibrillation, Sotalol and the fixed combination of chinidin and
      verapamil (Cordichin). Patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation/atrial flutter will be observed for a period of one year. The
      occurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is documented by transtelephonic ECG
      monitoring. Patients with document an ECG once daily, and recording is mandatory 
      in case of symptoms. ECGs are transmitted to a central data base for analysis.
      This clinical trial is designed to answer the following questions: (1) What is
      the average rate of spontaneous events of symptomatic atrial fibrillation? (2) Is
      it possible to reduce the frequency of symptomatic events by chronic
      antiarrhythmic drug administration? (3) What is the long-term frequency for the
      occurrence of severe side-effects under antiarrhythmic medication? The primary
      endpoint is defined as the time to first recurrence of symptomatic arrhythmia
      after reaching steady-state plasma concentrations of the study medication. The
      trial started in November 1997 and is planned to be finished by the end of 1999.

TI  - Combination of calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenoceptor blockers for
      patients with exercise-induced angina pectoris: a double-blind parallel-group
      comparison of different classes of calcium channel blockers. Netherlands Working 
      Group on Cardiovascular Research (WCN).
PG  - 493-8
AB  - AIMS: The combination of calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenoceptor blockers 
      is more effective for the treatment of exercise-induced angina pectoris than
      beta-adrenoceptor blocker monotherapy. As ischaemia in exercise-induced angina is
      preceded by increase in heart rate, calcium channel blockers with negative
      chronotropic properties may perform better for this purpose than nonchronotropic 
      compounds. METHODS: A 335 patient double-blind parallel-group study comparing 14 
      day treatment with amlodipine 5 and 10 mg, with diltiazem 200 and 300 mg, and
      mibefradil 50 and 100 mg added to baseline beta-adrenoceptor blocker treatment
      was performed. Exercise testing (ETT) was performed by bicycle ergometry.
      RESULTS: Although none of the calcium channel blockers improved duration of
      exercise or amount of workload, all significantly delayed onset of 1 mm
      ST-segment depression on ETT (P<0.001 for any treatment vs baseline). In
      addition, mibefradil, both low and high dose treatment, produced the longest
      delays (low dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 24.1 and 29.8 s,
      respectively, P<0. 003 and <0.001; high dose: different from diltiazem and
      amlodipine by 33.7 and 37.0 s, respectively, P<0.001 and <0.001). These effects
      were linearly correlated with the reduction in rate pressure product (RPP).
      Serious symptoms of dizziness occurred significantly more frequently on
      mibefradil (P<0.05), and 19 patients on mibefradil withdrew from trial.
      CONCLUSIONS: Calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic properties
      provide greater delay of ischaemia in patients with exercise-induced angina, but 
      the concomitant risk of intolerable dizziness attenuates this benefit.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the symptomatic well-being of elderly persons with
      isolated systolic hypertension. DESIGN AND SETTING: Well-being determined during 
      the placebo run-in period prior to entry to the Systolic Hypertension in Europe
      (SYST-EUR) trial. SUBJECTS: 641 People, 60 years or older with an average sitting
      blood pressure of 173/86 mm Hg. OUTCOME MEASURES: 33 Symptomatic complaints
      determined by a standard interview. RESULTS: The 437 women complained of 25% of
      the symptoms and the 204 men 21% (P<0.001). A markedly higher prevalence was
      observed in women compared with men for: pain in the joints of the hands (35% of 
      women complained of this against 22% of men); 'racing heart' (33% against 17%);
      dry eyes (16% against 6%); blurring of vision (35% against 23%); cramps in the
      legs (43% against 31%); and a sore throat (15% against 7%). Nocturia was the most
      frequent complaint (68% in both sexes). Eight symptoms increased with age and one
      (rash) tended to decline. With increasing systolic pressure women also reported
      more headaches, unsteadiness, blurring of vision, irregular heart beat and
      'racing heart' but, of these, only headaches increased with diastolic pressure.
      These observations were made after adjusting for age, blood sugar and body mass
      index (BMI) and were not observed in men. Higher blood sugars were associated
      with mouth ulcers, 'racing heart', blurring of vision and cramps in the legs. A
      higher BMI was associated with six symptoms, and a lower age of leaving education
      with eight. In men, alcohol consumption was related to 'racing heart', and
      smoking to wheezing and having a dry cough. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of
      complaint was associated with female gender, increasing age, blood sugar and BMI 
      and a low age of leaving education.

AB  - The Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial proved that blood pressure
      (BP) lowering therapy starting with nitrendipine reduces the risk of
      cardiovascular complications in older (> or = 60 years) patients with isolated
      systolic hypertension (systolic BP > or = 160 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 95 mm Hg).
      After the completion of the Syst-Eur trial on 14 February 1997, 3506 consenting
      patients (93.0% of those eligible) were enrolled in phase 2 of the Syst-Eur
      trial. This open follow-up study aims to confirm the safety of long-term
      antihypertensive therapy based on a dihydropyridine. To lower the sitting
      systolic BP below 150 mm Hg (target BP), the first-line agent nitrendipine (10-40
      mg/day) may be associated with enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide
      (12.5-25 mg/day), both add-on study drugs, or if required any other
      antihypertensive agent. On 1 November 1998, 3248 patients were still being
      followed, 86 patients had proceeded to non-supervised follow-up, and 43 had died.
      The median follow-up in Syst-Eur 2 was 14.3 months. At the last available visit, 
      systolic/diastolic BP in the patients formerly randomised to placebo (n = 1682)
      or active treatment (n = 1824), had decreased by 13.2/5.2 mm Hg and by 4.6/1.6 mm
      Hg, respectively, so that the between-group BP difference was 1.7 mm Hg systolic 
      (95% Ci: 0.8 to 2.6 mm Hg; P < 0.001) and 0.9 mm Hg diastolic (95% Cl: 0.4 to 1.5
      mm mm Hg; P < 0.001). At the beginning of Syst-Eur 2, the goal BP was reached by 
      25.4% and 50.6% of the former placebo and active-treatment groups; at the last
      visit these proportions were 55.9% and 63.1%, respectively. At that moment, 45.9%
      of the patients were on monotherapy with nitrendipine, 29.3% took nitrendipine in
      combination with other study drugs. Until the end of 2001, BP control of the
      Syst-Eur 2 patients will be further improved. Cardiovascular complications and
      adverse events, such as cancer or gastro-intestinal bleeding, will be monitored
      and validated by blinded experts.

TI  - Effects of calcium-channel blockade in older patients with diabetes and systolic 
      hypertension. Systolic Hypertension in Europe Trial Investigators.
PG  - 677-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports suggest that calcium-channel blockers may be harmful
      in patients with diabetes and hypertension. We previously reported that
      antihypertensive treatment with the calcium-channel blocker nitrendipine reduced 
      the risk of cardiovascular events. In this post hoc analysis, we compared the
      outcome of treatment with nitrendipine in diabetic and nondiabetic patients.
      METHODS: After stratification according to center, sex, and presence or absence
      of previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients (age, > or =60 years)
      with systolic blood pressure of 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic pressure below 95 
      mm Hg were randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo. Active
      treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg per day) with the possible
      addition or substitution of enalapril (5 to 20 mg per day) or hydrochlorothiazide
      (12.5 to 25 mg per day) or both, titrated to reduce the systolic blood pressure
      by at least 20 mm Hg and to less than 150 mm Hg. In the control group, matching
      placebo tablets were administered similarly. RESULTS: At randomization, 492
      patients (10.5 percent) had diabetes. After a median follow-up of two years, the 
      systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the placebo and active-treatment groups
      differed by 8.6 and 3.9 mm Hg, respectively, among the diabetic patients. Among
      the 4203 patients without diabetes, systolic and diastolic pressures differed by 
      10.3 and 4.5 mm Hg, respectively, in the two groups. After adjustment for
      possible confounders, active treatment was found to have reduced overall
      mortality by 55 percent (from 45.1 deaths per 1000 patients to 26.4 deaths per
      1000 patients), mortality from cardiovascular disease by 76 percent, all
      cardiovascular events combined by 69 percent, fatal and nonfatal strokes by 73
      percent, and all cardiac events combined by 63 percent in the group of patients
      with diabetes. Among the nondiabetic patients, active treatment decreased all
      cardiovascular events combined by 26 percent and fatal and nonfatal strokes by 38
      percent. In the group of patients receiving active treatment, reductions in
      overall mortality, mortality from cardiovascular disease, and all cardiovascular 
      events were significantly larger among the diabetic patients than among the
      nondiabetic patients (P=0.04, P=0.02, and P=0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
      Nitrendipine-based antihypertensive therapy is particularly beneficial in older
      patients with diabetes and isolated systolic hypertension. Thus, our findings do 
      not support the hypothesis that the use of long-acting calcium-channel blockers
      may be harmful in diabetic patients.

TI  - Prevalence of gingival overgrowth induced by calcium channel blockers: a
      community-based study.
PG  - 63-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of gingival overgrowth induced by chronic medication
      with calcium channel blockers is uncertain. Although there have been several
      studies examining this question, the results are conflicting, with previous
      estimates ranging from 20% to 83%. There have been only 2 studies examining the
      prevalence of overgrowth induced by diltiazem and amlodipine, with estimates of
      74% and 3.3%, respectively. METHODS: The current study aimed to address the
      problems associated with these studies by examining a sample of patients taking
      one of 3 calcium channel blockers, who were drawn from a community-based
      population in northeastern England. Nine hundred eleven (911) subjects were
      recruited from general medical practices in the area. Of these, 442 were taking
      nifedipine, 181 amlodipine, and 186 diltiazem. In addition, 102 control subjects 
      were examined. Drug and demographic data for each subject were recorded. The
      periodontal condition of all subjects was assessed including plaque index,
      papillary bleeding index, and a photograph of the anterior gingivae for
      subsequent analysis of overgrowth severity. RESULTS: More than six percent (6.3%)
      of subjects taking nifedipine were seen to have significant overgrowth. This
      overgrowth was statistically greater than the amount of overgrowth seen in either
      of the other 2 drug groups or the control population. The prevalence of gingival 
      overgrowth induced by amlodipine or diltiazem was not statistically significant
      when compared to the control group. The severity of overgrowth within the
      nifedipine group was found to be related to the amount of gingival inflammation
      and also to the gender of the subject, with males being 3 times as likely to
      develop overgrowth than females. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of clinically
      significant overgrowth related to chronic medication with calcium channel
      blockers is low, i.e., 6.3% for nifedipine. Males are 3 times as likely as
      females to develop clinically significant overgrowth. The presence of gingival
      inflammation is an important cofactor for the expression of this effect.

TI  - Improved efficacy with maintained tolerability in the treatment of primary
      hypertension. Comparison between the felodipine-metoprolol combination tablet and
      monotherapy with enalapril. Swedish Multicentre Group.
PG  - 55-60
AB  - In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study, 120 out-patients with
      mild to moderate primary hypertension were randomised, after a 4-week
      single-blind placebo run-in period, to a combination tablet of
      felodipine-metoprolol 5/50 mg (Logimax, Mobloc, Astra) once daily or enalapril 10
      mg once daily. If blood pressure (BP) remained suboptimally controlled after 4
      weeks (supine diastolic BP >90 mm Hg 24-h post dose), the dose was doubled for a 
      further 4 weeks. After 8 weeks felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine BP
      significantly more than enalapril (19.7/12.0 mmHg and 11.1/7.2 mm Hg,
      respectively). The mean differences in change in BP between treatments were
      8.6/4.8 mm Hg in favour of felodipine-metoprolol (P = 0.001/P <0.001). A
      statistically significant difference to the advantage of felodipine-metoprolol
      was also seen in standing BP. Even though the dose was increased in a larger
      proportion of patients in the enalapril group (61%) than in the
      felodipine-metoprolol group (40%), fewer enalapril-treated patients achieved
      adequate BP control (41% vs 63% on felodipine-metoprolol, P <0.05). Both
      treatments were well tolerated. Three patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol
      and four with enalapril discontinued treatment due to adverse events. A similar
      number of patients reported adverse events in each treatment group. In
      conclusion, a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 5/50-10/100 mg once
      daily reduced BP more effectively than enalapril 10-20 mg once daily 24 h post
      dose. The result was expected, but a more important observation was that both
      treatments were tolerated to a similar degree. Obviously, a considerable BP
      reduction may be well tolerated, as was the main purpose to demonstrate in this
      study.

TI  - Analysis of arrhythmias in the Circadian Antiischemia Program in Europe (CAPE)
      study.
PG  - 135-9
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze whether, in patients with long-standing (>4 
      years) coronary artery disease (CAD), the addition of the long-acting calcium
      channel blocker (CCB) amlodipine to conventional treatment [beta-blockers (BBLs) 
      and nitrates] during anginal attacks would have a proarrhythmic effect. This was 
      tested by analyzing data from patients who had taken part in the Circadian
      Anti-ischemia Program in Europe (CAPE) trial. After a 2-week, single-blind,
      run-in period (Phase 1), patients were randomized to amlodipine, 5 mg/day (first 
      4 weeks) and 10 mg/day (second 4 weeks), or placebo for 8 weeks (Phase 2). The
      48-h Holter data were analyzed for 167 amlodipine-treated patients and 83 placebo
      patients based on a 2:1 randomization scheme. Sixty-three per cent of amlodipine 
      patients and 67% of placebo patients were receiving concomitant BBLs, and >90%
      had taken sublingual nitrates during anginal attacks, as basic antiischemic
      therapy. After 7 weeks of therapy, when 48-h Holter monitoring was repeated,
      there were no significant changes in the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in 
      the placebo or amlodipine groups for all patients or subgroups of patients with
      or without BBLs. Also, between-group comparisons showed no significant
      differences in arrhythmias between amlodipine and placebo patients. In summary,
      amlodipine (5-10 mg/day) given to patients with severe, chronic CAD receiving
      conventional antiischemic therapy, did not produce any proarrhythmic effects.

TI  - Long-term efficacy and adverse event of nifedipine sustained-release tablets for 
      cyclosporin A-induced hypertension in patients with psoriasis.
PG  - 563-8
AB  - Thirteen psoriatic patients with hypertension during the course of cyclosporin A 
      therapy were treated for 25 months with a calcium channel blocker,
      sustained-release nifedipine, to study the clinical antihypertensive effects and 
      adverse events during treatment with both drugs. Seven of the 13 patients had
      exhibited a subclinical hypertensive state before cyclosporin A therapy. Both
      systolic and diastolic blood pressures of these 13 patients were decreased
      significantly after 4 weeks of nifedipine therapy, and blood pressure was
      maintained within the normal range thereafter for 25 months. The adverse events
      during combined therapy with cyclosporin A and nifedipine included an increase in
      blood urea nitrogen levels in 9 of the 13 patients and development of gingival
      hyperplasia in 2 of the 13 patients. Our findings indicate that sustained-release
      nifedipine is useful for hypertensive psoriatic patients under long-term
      treatment with cyclosporin A, but that these patients should be monitored for
      gingival hyperplasia.

TI  - Calcium channel blocker use and the risk of prostate cancer.
PG  - 1420-5
AB  - A recent study suggested that the risk of all cancers, including prostate cancer,
      is increased by the use of calcium channel blockers. The objective of this study 
      was to determine whether prostate cancer is associated with calcium channel
      blocker use. A case-control study was conducted in Massachusetts using cases
      diagnosed from December 1992 through February 1995. Cases were men identified by 
      tumor registrars who were less than 70 years old with newly diagnosed prostate
      cancer. Controls were men with no history of prostate cancer or symptoms of
      undiagnosed prostate cancer, and were matched to the cases on precinct of
      residence and half-decade of age. A total of 1217 cases of prostate cancer and
      1400 community controls are included in this analysis. Data were collected by
      telephone interview. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate relative
      risks for calcium channel blockers use while controlling for confounding. The
      relative risk for prostate cancer for any use of calcium channel blockers
      relative to nonuse was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-1.5). There was no 
      evidence of a trend according to duration of use. When the analysis was confined 
      to symptomatic men, the relative risk estimate was 1.1 (0.8-1.4) overall and 1.2 
      (0.8-1.7) among those aged 65 to 69 years. Relative risk estimates for the use of
      other classes of antihypertensive drugs among symptomatic men were close to 1.0; 
      the corresponding estimates among asymptomatic men were generally further from
      1.0. These findings suggest that calcium channel blockers do not increase the
      risk of prostate cancer. The differences in the relative risk estimates between
      symptomatic and asymptomatic men are compatible with detection bias. Because of
      the widespread use of Prostate-Specific Antigen testing for early detection of
      prostate cancer, potential detection bias needs to be considered in future
      studies of prostate cancer.

TI  - [The TEAM study--a study of the effectiveness and tolerance of treatment of
      essential hypertension with a fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil].
PG  - 326-31
AB  - The TEAM trial investigated the effectiveness and tolerance of a fixed
      combination of the ACE inhibitor and calcium channel blocker (2 mg trandolapril
      and 180 mg verapamil retard) (preparation Tarka) in an open multicentre
      prospective study of treatment of moderately severe hypertension (diastolic
      pressure at the end of the two-week wash-out period 100-115 mm Hg). The trial
      comprised 163 patients who were treated first for four weeks by a monotherapy
      with 2 mg trandolapril. After these four weeks patients who attained normal blood
      pressure proceeded with trandolapril treatment. Hypertensive patients who did not
      attain normal diastolic pressure levels were treated for another four weeks by a 
      fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR. After four weeks of treatment
      with trandolapril 62 patients of 163 (37%) had a diastolic blood pressure of less
      than 90 mm Hg. The fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR reduced the
      diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg in 71.6% of the patients resistant
      to treatment with 2 mg trandolapril and in another 15.6% of patients it reduced
      the diastolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg or more. After two months of treatment
      60 patients had a normal blood pressure due to trandolapril (37%) and another 73 
      patients (45%) treated by a combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR, i.e. a 
      total of 133 patients (82%) who originally suffered from moderately severe
      hypertension, attained a normal diastolic blood pressure. The mean decrease of
      diastolic pressure after two months of treatment was 19.5 mm Hg in
      "non-respondents" to trandolapril monotherapy and 23.6 mm Hg in "respondents".
      The mean decrease of systolic pressure in "non-respondents" and "respondents"
      after trandolapril treatment was 19.5 mm Hg and 35.0 mm Hg resp. The fixed
      combination of trandolapril and verapamil was not only effective but was
      associated with a minimum of undesirable effects. The incidence of headaches
      declined significantly. The combination of the above preparations is useful also 
      because both preparations have a cardio- and nephroprotective effect and do not
      affect the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Treatment with a fixed combination 
      of trandolapril and verapamil SR is indicated in moderately severe hypertension
      not responding to monotherapy, in particular when associated with diabetes,
      hyperlipoproteinaemia, ischaemic heart disease or left ventricular hypertrophy.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality in a cohort of
      U.S. women: the nurses' health study.
PG  - 2003-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested that the use of calcium channel blockers 
      may increase the risk of cancer. A possible association of the use of calcium
      channel blockers with cancer incidence and cancer mortality was addressed using
      data from the Nurses' Health Study. METHODS: In this study, a total of 18,635
      female nurses reported regularly taking at least 1 of 4 cardiovascular
      medications in 1988: diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and/or
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Cancer incidence and cancer
      deaths were ascertained until 1994. RESULTS: During 6 years of follow-up, 852
      women were newly diagnosed with cancer and 335 women died of cancer. Women who
      reported the use of calcium channel blockers had no increased risk of newly
      diagnosed cancer compared with those taking other cardiovascular drugs (relative 
      risk=1.02; 95% CI 0.83-1.26). The relative risk of dying from cancer associated
      with the self-reported use of calcium channel blockers was 1.25 (95% CI
      0.91-1.72). Relative risks were adjusted for the following self-reported factors:
      age; weight; height; cholesterol level; systolic and diastolic blood pressure;
      smoking; alcohol intake; physical activity; menopausal status; postmenopausal
      hormone use; aspirin use; and history of diabetes, cancer, stroke, myocardial
      infarction, coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous transluminal coronary
      angioplasty, angina, and hypertension. Regarding site specific cancer incidence
      and mortality, only lung cancer incidence was somewhat increased (RR=1.61; 95% CI
      0.88-2.96). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest no important increase in overall
      cancer incidence or cancer mortality related to the self-reported use of calcium 
      channel blockers.

      hypertension: the Syst-Eur Vascular Dementia Project.
PG  - 963-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess cognitive functions and their correlates for a dementia-free
      cohort of old patients with isolated systolic hypertension. DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional data from the randomization period of the European Trial in
      Elderly with Systolic Hypertension (Syst-Eur Vascular Dementia Project). SETTING:
      Sixteen European countries and Israel. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 2252 patients
      aged 60-100 years (mean 70). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mini Mental State Examination
      (MMSE) and Spearman correlation of MMSE scores to demographic data or blood
      pressure. RESULTS: The MMSE was successfully completed for 1474 women and 751
      men. The baseline blood pressure averaged 173 +/- 10/86 +/- 6 mmHg (means +/-
      SD). Median age at which education of patients at school had stopped was 15
      years. Men and women who consumed alcohol (28%) had median intakes of 8 and 3
      g/day, respectively. The median MMSE score was 29 (range 15-30). The maximum
      score of 30 was attained by 609 (30%) subjects. Fifty-nine (3%) patients had a
      MMSE score of 23 or less. The MMSE score decreased with advancing age (r = -0.21,
      P < 0.001). Both for men and for women, it was positively correlated to the level
      of education (r = 0.30 and r = 0.32, P < 0.001). For women after adjustment for
      age and the level of education, the score was correlated negatively to systolic
      blood pressure (r = -0.07, P < 0.05) but positively to intake of alcohol (r =
      0.06, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In a cohort of elderly patients with isolated
      systolic hypertension, baseline cognitive function measured in terms of the MMSE 
      score was high, probably due to selective recruitment of patients who were not
      clinically demented. Blood pressure was a weak contributor to cognitive status
      compared with age and level of education. Baseline cognitive function of women
      was negatively and independently correlated to systolic blood pressure.

      data from the Syst-Eur trial. Syst-Eur Trial Investigators.
PG  - 1117-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe measures of quality of life of elderly patients with
      isolated systolic hypertension at entry to a placebo-controlled randomized trial 
      of antihypertensive treatment and to investigate factors associated with these.
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses at entry to a randomized controlled trial.
      SETTING: Patients attending hypertension clinics or general practitioners'
      surgeries at 30 centres in 10 European countries. PATIENTS: Six hundred and
      thirty-one patients aged 60 years or more, with a sitting systolic blood pressure
      during the run-in phase of 160-219 mmHg, a sitting diastolic blood pressure below
      95 mmHg and a standing systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or more. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Cognitive function tests (Reitan Trail Making A and B), Brief
      Assessment Index (a measure of depressed mood) and four subscales from the
      Sickness Impact Profile (Ambulation, Social Interaction, Sleep and Rest and
      Housework). RESULTS: Poor quality of life was generally associated with
      increasing age, previous treatment with antihypertensive drugs, presence of
      cardiovascular complications and, among women, high diastolic blood pressure,
      higher consumption of alcohol and high body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: At entry to 
      the trial there was considerable heterogeneity of patients in terms of measures
      of quality of life and cognitive performance. It remains to be determined whether
      these influence subsequent quality of life during randomized treatment.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers for prevention of noise trauma in otologic surgery.
PG  - 400-5
AB  - One hundred patients were tested prior to otologic ear surgery in a prospective, 
      randomized, double-blind study to assess the perioperative efficiacy of a calcium
      channel blocker (diltiazem) in preventing acoustical trauma during middle ear
      surgery. The patients were randomly divided into a therapy group (diltiazem), and
      a control group (placebo). Bone conduction hearing thresholds were examined
      preoperatively and followed at 1 day and 3 months postoperatively.
      Frequency-dependent changes in postoperative bone conduction and the number of
      patients with various degrees of postoperative hearing loss in both groups were
      statistically analyzed. The results indicated only a small postoperative hearing 
      loss after ear surgery in both groups. There was a tendency for better results in
      the therapy group but this was not found to be statistically significant. Despite
      favorable results in animal trials utilizing different kinds of noise with the
      prophylactic application of diltiazem, further studies in humans will be needed
      to determine the role of calcium antagonist drugs in the prophylaxis or treatment
      of acoustical trauma.

TI  - The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial of
      cardiovascular events in hypertension. Rationale and design.
PG  - 176-83
AB  - Essential hypertension is a major Public Health issue. Although the number of
      treated hypertensive patients has increased, only 25% of treated patients have
      their blood pressure levels under control. The benefit of treating hypertension
      has been proven, but cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates remain high.
      The ideal antihypertensive drug should not only normalize blood pressure levels, 
      but also reduce the associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. The 
      role of angiotensin II in systemic hypertension and its complications has been
      recently redefined. The potent trophic effects of angiotensin II on blood vessels
      and on cardiac cells have been well demonstrated, especially the role of
      angiotensin II in left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular hypertrophy, endothelial
      dysfunction, and congestive heart failure. Of all ongoing mortality and morbidity
      trials in systemic hypertension, VALUE (Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use 
      Evaluation) is the only one comparing an angiotensin II antagonist (valsartan)
      with a third-generation calcium channel blocker (amlodipine). The main hypothesis
      of the VALUE trial is that, for an equivalent decrease in blood pressure,
      valsartan will be more effective than amlodipine in decreasing cardiac mortality 
      and morbidity. VALUE is a prospective, multinational, multicentre, double-blind, 
      randomized, active-controlled, 2-arm parallel group comparison with a
      response-dependent dose titration scheme. VALUE involves 14,400 patients in over 
      30 countries, who will be followed for 4 years or until 1450 patients experience 
      a primary endpoint. The population to be included in VALUE consists of
      hypertensive men and women, aged 50 years or older, and at a relatively high risk
      of sustaining a cardiovascular event. The high risk profile is defined taking
      into account age, gender, and a list of cardiovascular risk factors and disease
      factors. Risk factors are cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes
      mellitus, uncomplicated left ventricular hypertrophy, proteinuria, and high serum
      creatinine. Disease factors include documented history of myocardial infarction, 
      peripheral vascular disease, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or the
      presence of left ventricular hypertrophy with strain on the ECG. A unique feature
      of VALUE is the assessment of the predictive power of this cardiovascular risk
      factor scale in a large population of treated hypertensive patients. The trial
      started on 10 September 1997.

TI  - Is the use of some calcium antagonists linked to cancer? Evidence from recent
      observational studies.
PG  - 99-108
AB  - In animal and in vitro studies, several calcium antagonists have been shown to
      block apoptosis (programmed cell death), a natural cellular defence against
      cancer. On the basis of these studies, it has been hypothesised that calcium
      antagonists may function as cancer promoters and that they might cause cancer in 
      humans. The association between the use of calcium antagonists and cancer has
      been addressed recently in 6 independent epidemiological studies. Four of these
      studies--2 cohort and 2 case-control--found a significantly higher risk of cancer
      among users of certain calcium antagonists as compared with either non-users or
      with users of other antihypertensive agents. The other 2 studies failed to find
      support for this association. All studies had limitations of varying types and
      significance. The emerging pattern from these investigations includes the
      following features: (i) the strength of the association appears to be dependent
      on daily dosage, ranging from no association in users of low dosages to a 2-fold 
      (or possibly higher) increased risk in users of higher dosages; (ii) the time lag
      to the appearance of this association appears to be at least 2 to 3 years; (iii) 
      an association with a higher risk of cancer has been found primarily for
      verapamil, while no such relationship has been reported for diltiazem; and (iv)
      no highly consistent associations have been shown with specific cancer sites or
      histological types. More data, preferably from long-term randomised clinical
      trials, are required before firm conclusions can be drawn.

TI  - Assessment of atrioventricular junction ablation and VVIR pacemaker versus
      pharmacological treatment in patients with heart failure and chronic atrial
      fibrillation: a randomized, controlled study.
PG  - 953-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled studies have suggested that atrioventricular junction
      ablation and pacemaker implantation have beneficial effects on quality of life in
      patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed
      a multicenter, controlled, randomized, 12-month evaluation of the clinical
      effects of atrioventricular junction ablation and VVIR pacemaker (Abl+Pm) versus 
      pharmacological (drug) treatment in 66 patients with chronic (lasting >6 months) 
      AF who had clinically manifest heart failure and heart rate >90 bpm on 3 standard
      ECGs recorded at rest during stable clinical conditions on different days. Before
      completion of the study, withdrawals occurred in 8 patients of the drug group and
      in 4 patients of the Abl+Pm group. At the end of the 12 months, the 28 Abl+Pm
      patients who completed the study showed lower scores in palpitations (-78%;
      P=0.000) and effort dyspnea (-22%; P=0.05) than the 26 of the drug group. Lower
      scores, although not significant, were also observed for exercise intolerance
      (-20%), easy fatigue (-17%), chest discomfort (-50%), Living with Heart Failure
      Questionnaire (-14%), New York Heart Association functional classification (-4%),
      and Activity scale (-12%). The intrapatient comparison between enrollment and
      month 12 showed that in the Abl+Pm group, all variables except easy fatigue
      improved significantly from 14% to 82%. However, because an improvement was also 
      observed in the drug group, the difference between the 2 groups was significant
      only for palpitations (P=0.000), effort dyspnea (P=0.01), exercise intolerance
      (P=0.005), easy fatigue (P=0.02), and chest discomfort (P=0.02). Cardiac
      performance, evaluated by means of standard echocardiogram and exercise test, did
      not differ significantly between the 2 groups and remained stable over time.
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with heart failure and chronic AF, Abl+Pm treatment is
      effective and superior to drug therapy in controlling symptoms, although its
      efficacy appears to be less than that observed in uncontrolled studies because
      some improvement can also be expected in medically treated patients. Cardiac
      performance is not modified by the treatment.

TI  - Managing migraine.
PG  - 41-4
AB  - There have been important advances in the management of migraine headache since
      we last reviewed the subject in 1981. Formal diagnostic criteria, which were
      introduced in 1988, have led to more reliable assessment of the prevalence of
      migraine and how it affects attendance and efficiency at work. In addition, the
      use of the 5HT1 agonists has become established. In this article, we discuss how 
      these changes have altered the management of migraine in adults.

      relaxation of the bladder detrusor muscle. A placebo controlled, randomized
      clinical test].
PG  - 486-91
AB  - Therapy of detrusor hyperactivity with anticholinergic agents often is followed
      by adverse drug reactions. Intravesical application may be an interesting
      alternative. A randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, mono-centre clinical
      trial was carried out in 84 patients with urgency or urge incontinence. Due to
      intravesical administration of oxybutynin (CAS 5633-20-5) (n = 21) and trospium
      chloride (CAS 10405-02-4) (n = 21), respectively, a significant increase in
      maximum bladder capacity and decrease of detrusor pressure accompanied by an
      increase of residual urine were found in comparison to placebo in urodynamical
      investigations. Improvement of uninhibited bladder contractions occurred leading 
      to higher filling volume. Under verapamil (CAS 152-11-4) (n = 21) no marked
      changes in the efficacy variables were found compared with placebo. All patients 
      completed the study and were assessed with regard to efficacy and safety. No
      adverse events or marked changes in the vital signs were reported. The immediate 
      onset of effect and the lack of adverse drug reactions suggest that treatment
      with topical oxybutynin or trospium chloride is an effective alternative in
      patients with intolerable side effects when orally treated. In addition,
      intravesical administration may be indicated in patients with bladder spasms due 
      to indwelling catheter or in order to increase bladder capacity before
      percutaneous cystostomy.

TI  - Amlodipine: a randomized, blinded clinical trial in 9 cats with systemic
      hypertension.
PG  - 157-62
AB  - The efficacy of amlodipine (AML) was tested in hypertensive cats in a
      placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded clinical trial. Five cats were randomized
      to receive 0.625 mg AML once daily and 4 cats to receive placebo (PLA) once
      daily. The average systolic blood pressure (SBP) recorded by the Doppler method
      on day 0 was 212 +/- 21 mm Hg in the AML group and 216 +/- 32 mm Hg in the PLA
      group. On day 7, the cats receiving AML had a significantly lower average daily
      SBP (160 +/- 30 mm Hg) but SBP in the PLA group was unchanged (207 +/- 31 mm Hg).
      On day 7, all cats receiving PLA and one cat receiving AML were crossed over to
      the other group because of inadequate response. Blood pressure did not decrease
      adequately in 3 cats by day 14 (7 days of PLA and 7 days AML) and the treatment
      code was broken. Each of these cats was subsequently administered 1.25 mg AML
      daily. Cats requiring 1.25 mg AML once daily (6.1 kg +/- 0.7 kg) weighed
      significantly more than cats that responded to 0.625 mg AML once daily (4.1 +/-
      0.7 kg). The average daily SBP recorded in the 6 cats that completed the study
      was significantly lower after 16 weeks of treatment (152 +/- 14 mm Hg) compared
      to day 0 (221 +/- 24 mm Hg). Three cats were euthanized before completion of the 
      study. All 3 cats were responders to AML on day 7. SBPs measured 24 hours after

TI  - Intravenous diltiazem and acute renal failure after cardiac operations.
PG  - 1316-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perioperative administration of intravenous diltiazem to patients
      undergoing cardiac procedures has been shown to decrease the incidence of
      ischemia and arrhythmias. However, after adopting this practice in our cardiac
      surgery program, we perceived an increased incidence of postoperative renal
      dysfunction. METHODS: A directed record review of postoperative renal function
      was conducted for consecutive patients undergoing cardiac operation for the time 
      periods before and after adoption of prophylactic intravenous diltiazem (0.1
      mg.kg-1.h-1 for 24 hours). The two groups were compared using chi 2 and
      two-sample t tests. The risk of development of postoperative renal failure was
      modeled with logistic regression. RESULTS: Diltiazem-treated patients (n = 271)
      were similar to the control patients (n = 143) in terms of age (64 versus 61
      years; p = 0.14), ejection fraction (0.46 versus 0.47; p = 0.61), baseline serum 
      creatinine level (1.2 versus 1.1 mg/dL; p = 0.27), prevalence of comorbid
      conditions, and surgical characteristics. The prevalence of left main coronary
      artery disease was lower in the diltiazem group than the control group (39%
      versus 52%; p = 0.01). During the 7-day postoperative period, the average peak
      serum creatinine level was higher in the diltiazem group (1.7 +/- 0.9 mg/dL; mean
      +/- 1 standard deviation) than the control group (1.5 +/- 0.5 mg/dL; p = 0.003). 
      The incidence of acute renal failure requiring dialysis was 4.4% in the diltiazem
      group versus 0.7% in the control group (p = 0.04). There was no difference in
      length of hospitalization or mortality. The risk of acute renal failure was
      strongly associated with intravenous diltiazem (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 6.3; p 
      = 0.08), age (AOR 2.5 per 10 years; p = 0.07), baseline serum creatinine (AOR 4.8
      per 1 mg/dL; p = 0.02), the presence of left main coronary disease (AOR 5.3; p = 
      0.02), and the presence of cerebrovascular disease (AOR 4.5; p = 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective analysis suggests that prophylactic use of
      intravenous diltiazem in patients undergoing cardiac operations was associated
      with increased renal dysfunction. Further studies of the risk and benefits of
      intravenous diltiazem in this setting should be undertaken.

      patients.
PG  - 163-9
AB  - Issues raised recently concerning the safety of calcium channel blockers (CCBs)
      prompted an analysis of the occurrence of cardiovascular events and death in the 
      Pfizer Inc. hypertension clinical trial databases for amlodipine (Norvasc) and
      nifedipine in the gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation
      (Procardia XL). Prospectively defined analyses of data from comparative and
      noncomparative trials of amlodipine and nifedipine GITS were conducted. Outcome
      measures included cardiovascular and noncardiovascular deaths, and adverse
      cardiovascular events including new/worsened angina, myocardial infarction (MI), 
      serious arrhythmia, stroke, congestive heart failure, and bleeding. Among all
      amlodipine-treated patients (n = 32,920), the incidence rates for all-cause
      death, MI, and new/worsened angina were 3.0, 3.3, and 1.6/1,000 patient-years of 
      exposure, respectively. Among those in comparative trials alone (n = 4,126), the 
      all-cause death rate was 4.1/1,000 patient-years, which was comparable to that of
      other non-CCB agents and significantly less than that of other CCBs (23.8/1,000
      patient-years, p = 0.015), although the difference in rates represents only 2
      deaths. Among all nifedipine-GITS-treated patients (n = 2,645), the rate of
      all-cause death was 4.1/1,000 patient-years, of MI 6.5/1,000 patient-years, and
      of new/ worsened angina 5.7/1,000 patient-years. The incidence rates for MI and
      other cardiac events were low in these hypertension trials, and did not differ
      among treatment groups in either the amlodipine or nifedipine GITS comparative
      analyses. In the clinical trial databases analyzed, there is no signal suggesting
      excessive risk of death or cardiovascular events for hypertensive patients
      treated with amlodipine or nifedipine GITS.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind comparison of intravenous diltiazem and digoxin for
      atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery.
PG  - 739-47
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary bypass graft surgery may
      result in hypotension, heart failure symptoms, embolic complications, and
      prolongation in length of hospital stay (LOHS). The purpose of this study was to 
      determine whether intravenous diltiazem is more effective than digoxin for
      ventricular rate control in AF after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A
      secondary end point was to determine whether ventricular rate control with
      diltiazem reduces postoperative LOHS compared with digoxin. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      Patients with AF and ventricular rate > 100 beats/min within 7 days after
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomly assigned to receive
      intravenous therapy with diltiazem (n = 20) or digoxin (n = 20). Efficacy was
      measured with ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter monitoring). Safety was
      assessed by clinical monitoring and electrocardiographic recording. LOHS was
      measured from the day of surgery. Data were analyzed with the intention-to-treat 
      principle in all randomly assigned patients. In addition, a separate
      intention-to-treat analysis was performed excluding patients who spontaneously
      converted to sinus rhythm. In the analysis of all randomly assigned patients,
      those who received diltiazem achieved ventricular rate control (> or = 20%
      decrease in pretreatment ventricular rate) in a mean of 10 +/- 20 (median 2)
      minutes compared with 352 +/- 312 (median 228) minutes for patients who received 
      digoxin (p < 0.0001). At 2 hours, the proportion of patients who achieved rate
      control was significantly higher in patients treated with diltiazem (75% vs 35%, 
      p = 0.03). Similarly, at 6 hours, the response rate associated with diltiazem was
      higher than that in the digoxin group (85% vs 45%, p = 0.02). However, response
      rates associated with diltiazem and digoxin at 12 and 24 hours were not
      significantly different. At 24 hours, conversion to sinus rhythm had occurred in 
      11 of 20 (55%) patients receiving diltiazem and 13 of 20 (65%) patients receiving
      digoxin (p = 0.75). Results of the analysis of only those patients who remained
      in AF were similar to those presented above. There was no difference between the 
      diltiazem-treated and digoxin-treated groups in postoperative LOHS (8.6 +/- 2.2
      vs 7.7 +/- 2.0 days, respectively, p = 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular rate
      control occurs more rapidly with intravenous diltiazem than digoxin in AF after
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery. However, 12- and 24-hour response rates and
      duration of postoperative hospital stay associated with the two drugs are
      similar.

TI  - Effects of verapamil and trandolapril in the treatment of hypertension.
      Trandolapril Study Group.
PG  - 322-7
AB  - The combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with a calcium
      antagonist has become a common way of treating patients with essential
      hypertension who respond insufficiently to monotherapy. This double-blind,
      randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, multicenter, outpatient study evaluated
      the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of a calcium antagonist (verapamil SR)
      and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril) in patients with
      mild-to-moderate (stages I and II) essential hypertension. Six hundred thirty-one
      patients were enrolled in this 10-week study. After a 4-week single-blind placebo
      phase, patients received one of the following daily dosage regimens in a
      double-blind fashion for 6 weeks: placebo, 4 mg of trandolapril, 240 mg of
      verapamil SR, or a combination of 4 mg of trandolapril and 240 mg of verapamil
      SR. Trough sitting diastolic blood pressure was lowered by 4.5 mm Hg, 4.3 mm Hg, 
      and 8.1 mm Hg more than placebo in the trandolapril, verapamil SR, and
      combination groups, respectively. In the combination group, sitting diastolic
      blood pressure was significantly lowered (P < .01) by 3.6 mm Hg more than in the 
      trandolapril group and by 3.8 mm Hg more than in the verapamil SR group. An
      analysis of the trough-to-peak ratio for sitting diastolic blood pressure
      revealed values of 0.75 and 0.67, for the 4-mg trandolapril and the combination
      groups, respectively, at end point. The overall incidence of adverse reactions
      was similar for all treatment groups. In this study the combination of an
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium antagonist was well tolerated
      and more effective than either agent administered alone for the treatment of
      mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.

TI  - [Comparison of anti-ischemic effect of bepridil and diltiazem evaluated by
      exercise test in patients with coronary disease. A multicenter study. Groupe
      d'Investigateurs].
PG  - 602-8
AB  - Bepridil (Cordium) is a calcium channel blocker which has been demonstrated to be
      effective in the preventive treatment of angina. Few controlled trials have
      compared bepridil to diltiazem (Tildiem), the reference calcium channel blocker. 
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bepridil
      in stable coronary patients. 148 patients (139 M, 9 F, mean age: 58 +/- 8.6
      years), with documented coronary artery disease and positive stress test after 5 
      days of placebo were included. After double-blind randomization, they received
      bepridil (300 mg/day ion 3 doses), or diltiazem (180 mg+/day in 3 doses) for 15
      days. A stress test was then performed under the same conditions as on inclusion.
      The anti-ischaemic efficacy of the two drugs was comparable. Total work increased
      from 4,552.4 +/- 2,179.4 Kpm a 6,103.2 +/- 2,849.2 Kpm with bepridil (p < or =
      0.0001) and from 4,524.8 +/- 2,160.5 Kpm a 5,848.3 +/- 2,800.3 Kpm (p < or =
      0.0001) with diltiazem, with no intergroup difference. Duration of effort was
      significantly prolonged: from 10.5 +/- 3.0 min to 12.5 +/- 3.3 min with bepridil 
      (p < or = 0.0001) and from 10.5 +/- 2.9 min to 12.1 +/- 3.4 min with diltiazem (p
      < or = 0.0001), with no intergroup difference. The time to onset of 1 min of ST
      depression increased significantly between the two stress tests, from 8.36 +/-
      2.7 min to 10.82 +/- 3.4 min with bepridil (p < or = 0.001) and from 8.02 +/- 3.0
      min to 10.53 +/- 3.6 min with diltiazem (p < or = 0.001), with no significant
      difference between the two groups. The clinical safety of the two products was
      comparable. On the electrocardiogram, the QT interval was significantly prolonged
      with bepridil, from 368.6 +/- 37.5 msec to 393.6 +/- 38.7 msec (p < or = 0.0001),
      reflecting cellular impregnation of the drug.

TI  - Hypertension optimal treatment (HOT) study: home blood pressure in treated
      hypertensive subjects.
PG  - 1014-20
AB  - The Hypertension Optimal Treatment Study is a prospective trial conducted in 26
      countries. The aims are to (1) evaluate the relationship between three levels of 
      target office diastolic blood pressure (BP) (< or = 80, < or = 85, or < or = 90
      mm Hg) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients and
      (2) examine the effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of 75 mg
      aspirin daily versus placebo. A total of 19,193 patients between 50 and 80 years 
      of age had been randomized by the end of April 1994. Treatment was initiated with
      felodipine 5 mg daily, and additional therapy was given in accordance with a set 
      protocol. The present substudy of 926 patients performed in nine countries aimed 
      to (1) compare home with office BP in a representative subsample of the HOT
      population after the titration of treatment was completed and (2) clarify whether
      the separation into the target groups could be expanded into the out-of-office
      setting. The differences between office and home measurements in diastolic BP of 
      0.2 mm Hg (SD, 9; 95% confidence interval, -0.36 to 0.81; P=.40) and systolic BP 
      of 0.5 mm Hg (SD, 15; 95% confidence interval, -0.53 to 1.46; P=.21) were not
      significant. The group differences in home BP were 1.9 mm Hg (< or = 80 versus < 
      or = 85) and 1.2 mm Hg (< or = 85 versus < or = 90) for diastolic BP (F=11.69;
      ANOVA, P<.0001) and 2.6 and 2.1 mm Hg for systolic BP (F=8.44, P=.0002). Thus,
      office and home BPs measured with the same semiautomatic device are comparable in
      treated hypertensive subjects in the HOT Study, and the separation into the
      target groups based on office readings prevails at home.

TI  - Use of calcium channel blockers in hypertension.
PG  - 533-62
AB  - During the past 20 years the number of subclasses of calcium channel blockers has
      increased from one to four. Three classes have only a single clinically approved 
      compound: verapamil, diltiazem, and mibefradil. The fourth class,
      dihydropyridines, contains numerous compounds. All agents are effective in
      lowering blood pressure in short-term studies, and side effects that trouble the 
      patient are infrequent. Long-term studies in hypertensive patients are limited.
      Short-acting agents such as nifedipine have been associated with an increased
      cardiovascular risk in some, but not all studies. These agents also probably
      create a compliance problem for hypertensive patients because of the need for
      multiple daily doses and their unpleasant side effects, e.g., ankle edema,
      palpitations, and flushing. Therefore, they are not useful or indicated for the
      treatment of hypertensive patients. No data have suggested that long-acting
      dihydropyridines or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers share the same
      fate. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest the opposite: they have a
      cardioprotective effect. However, definitive information will require the
      completion of several long-term trials, including ALLHAT, CONVINCE, HOT, INSIGHT 
      and NORDIL. Finally, it is important to reflect on the lessons learned from the
      controversy associated with the potential risks of calcium channel blockers.
      First, disagreements are common when one uses case-controlled studies and are
      reflective of the poor precision of the methods used. What is statistically
      relevant in one study may not hold true for another and may have no clinical
      relevance, particularly if the relative risk is less than 2. Investigators need
      to temper their enthusiasm to reflect this reality. Second, at the cutting edge
      of science there is probably relatively little agreement about what is correct
      among equally competent scientists. All have bias in their positions and should
      both recognize and admit so to themselves and their colleagues. Inferring that
      those who disagree have an unstated secondary agenda that will bring personal
      financial rewards or government accolades is inappropriate and counterproductive.
      Third, the randomized clinical trial, despite all its imperfections, is still the
      best tool to establish common ground on controversial issues. Finally, what may
      seem best from the public health perspective may not be in the best interest of
      the individual patient--a possibility that physicians have to constantly
      consider. For example, no public health benefit occurs if patients remain
      hypertensive because they fail to take their medications, no matter what the
      medication.

TI  - Pro-haemorrhagic effects of calcium antagonists: a comparison of isradipine and
      atenolol on ex vivo platelet function in hypertensive subjects.
PG  - 783-8
AB  - It has been suggested that long term treatment with calcium antagonist drugs
      might inhibit platelet function and lead to an anti-atheromatous effect. However 
      recent data have also suggested that such an effect might increase mortality due 
      to an increased incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. We identified 43 subjects
      from general practice with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension to compare
      the effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine with that of the beta-blocker
      atenolol on platelet function, plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels, fibrinolysis, 
      and serum lipids in a randomised double-blind parallel group study. After careful
      evaluation to exclude concomitant aspirin use, only 24 subjects were eligible to 
      enter the study. While isradipine and atenolol produced comparable and clinically
      significant falls in blood pressure (167 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 to 153 +/- 3/91 +/- 2 mm
      Hg, and 165 +/- 2/101 +/- 1 to 156 +/- 4/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively), neither
      drug produced a detectable effect on ex vivo platelet aggregation, platelet
      retention, or thromboxane generation with adrenaline, collagen,
      adenosine-di-phosphate, or platelet activating factor. However a decrease in
      plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels was observed which reached statistical
      significance (P < 0.05) after 12 weeks treatment in the isradipine but not the
      atenolol group. A 39% reduction with isradipine compared with 34% following
      atenolol treatment. Euglobulin clot lysis time was not altered by either drug.
      Serum cholesterol concentrations were also unaltered by drug treatment.
      Therapeutic doses of the calcium antagonist isradipine may produce a minor
      indirect effect on platelet function after several weeks of treatment. However,
      this is of doubtful clinical importance and may simply reflect an effect of
      lowered blood pressure on platelet function.

TI  - [Effect of diltiazem on concentration of cyclosporin metabolites in Sandimmune
      and Neoral treated kidney transplant patients].
PG  - 589-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diltiazem reduces the cyclosporine dose required for blood levels in 
      the therapeutic target range by 30 to 40%. The effect of diltiazem on the
      pharmacokinetic disposition of cyclosporine after oral Neoral application is
      unknown and it is unclear whether or not the diltiazem-cyclosporine interaction
      is affected by the galenic cyclosporine formulation. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Fifty-one stable renal allograft patients (19 females, 32 males) were enrolled in
      this prospective, randomized and double-blind study. The patients were assigned
      to 3 treatment groups: with diltiazem (I, n = 17), with nifedipine (II, n = 17)
      and without calcium channel blockers (III, n = 17). Nine patients in each group
      received Sandimmun and 8 patients Neoral. Blood concentrations of cyclosporine
      and its metabolites AM1 and AM9 were measured using HPLC for 12 weeks. The 3
      treatment groups were not different in respect to age, gender distribution and
      serum creatinine concentration. Cyclosporine doses were adjusted on basis of the 
      blood levels. RESULTS: The cyclosporine doses required to achieve target blood
      levels were significantly lower in group I compared with group II (-43%) and
      group III (-33%; p < 0.0001). Although the cyclosporine blood concentrations in
      all groups were in the therapeutic range, the blood levels in group I showed a
      much lower variability. The blood concentrations of the metabolite AM1 in group I
      were significantly higher than those in groups II and III after dose correction
      (p < 0.0001), those of AM9 were significantly lower in group I than in groups II 
      and III (p < 0.0001). The average dose, and the blood concentration of
      cyclosporine was not different when patients receiving Neoral were compared with 
      those receiving Sandimmun within the groups. In the patients in group I, the
      blood concentration of metabolite AM1 was significantly higher after Sandimmun
      application than after Neoral. No other differences in the metabolite
      concentrations were detected within the groups comparing patients taking
      Sandimmun or Neoral. The incidences of acute rejection were lower in group I
      (17.6%) than in the other groups (II: 52.9%; III: 41%). CONCLUSION: Diltiazem
      significantly reduced the necessary dose of cyclosporine. Compared with groups II
      and III, the blood concentrations were more stable in patients in group I.
      Diltiazem increased the blood concentration of AM1 in patients treated with
      Sandimmun to a larger extent than in patients taking Neoral. No additional
      pharmacokinetic differences of the 2 cyclosporine applications different with
      Sandimmun or Neoral were found.

TI  - Comparison of treatment of supraventricular tachycardia by Valsalva maneuver and 
      carotid sinus massage.
PG  - 30-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of the Valsalva maneuver with that of
      carotid sinus massage (CSM) in terminating paroxysmal supraventricular
      tachycardia (SVT) in the ED. METHODS: This prospective, randomized case study was
      performed in the ED of a tertiary care institution. Patients were at least 10
      years of age with regular narrow complex tachycardia and had an ECG diagnosis of 
      SVT. Patients with regular narrow complex tachycardia were randomly assigned to
      undergo either the Valsalva maneuver or CSM. If the tachycardia was not
      terminated by the method chosen by randomization, then the alternative method of 
      vagal maneuver was used. If the tachycardia was not converted by both methods of 
      vagal stimulation, patients would undergo either synchronized electrical
      cardioversion or a pharmacologic method of conversion at the discretion of the
      treating physician, depending on the patient's hemodynamic status. RESULTS: One
      hundred forty-eight instances of SVT were studied Sixty-two patients underwent
      Valsalva maneuver first with conversion in 12 (success rate of 19.4%). Eighty-six
      underwent CSM first with conversion in 9 (success rate 10.5%). Carotid sinus
      massage was used in the 50 cases of SVT in which conversion was not achieved with
      the Valsalva maneuver. Conversion occurred in 7 cases (success rate 14.0%). For
      the 77 cases of SVT in which initial CSM did not achieve conversion, conversion
      occurred in 13 with the Valsalva maneuver (success rate 16.9%). The Valsalva
      maneuver and CSM achieved conversion in a total of 41 instances of SVT (success
      rate 27.7%). CONCLUSION: Vagal maneuvers are efficacious in terminating about one
      quarter of spontaneous SVT cases. There is no detectable difference in efficacy
      between the Valsalva maneuver and CSM.

TI  - Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) for hypertensive patients
      in a primary care setting: results of the Extended Release Adalat Canadian Trial 
      (EXACT).
PG  - 924-35
AB  - Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) is an extended-release
      dosage formulation that provides sustained blood concentrations of nifedipine
      over 24 hours. A 20-week, postmarketing surveillance study of the effectiveness
      and patient tolerability of nifedipine GITS 30 or 60 mg was conducted in the
      offices of 187 Canadian general practitioners from September 1992 to March 1994. 
      A total of 1700 patients previously or newly diagnosed with mild-to-moderate
      essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure, 95 to 114 mm Hg) were
      included. The 20-week treatment period was completed by 1326 patients. Patients
      received nifedipine GITS 30 mg initially; the dose could be titrated upward to 60
      mg after 3 and 6 weeks. Of all patients entered, 605 (35.6%) reported one or more
      adverse events. The three most frequently occurring adverse events were headache 
      (12.2%), peripheral edema (8.1%), and dizziness (2.9%). The frequency of adverse 
      events was highest in the first 3 weeks and decreased subsequently. The overall
      incidence of adverse events was 29.8% in patients receiving 30 mg of nifedipine
      GITS and 25.3% in those receiving 60 mg; adverse events were the cause of study
      discontinuation in 12.3% of patients. The overall health status of patients as
      measured by the SF-36 questionnaire was comparable to that previously reported
      for healthy individuals. At baseline, mean (+/- SE) systolic/diastolic blood
      pressure values for all patients were 160.1 +/- 0.4/97.4 +/- 0.2 mm Hg. Final
      blood pressure readings after 20 weeks of treatment in the 30-mg group (141.5 +/-
      0.4/84.8 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and the 60-mg group (146.6 +/- 0.8/88.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg)
      were significantly decreased from baseline. At week 20, the 30-mg dose was
      sufficient to maintain blood pressure in 74.5% of patients; 25.5% of patients
      required 60 mg. Subgroup analysis revealed similar responses in patients who had 
      received blood pressure medication before study initiation and those who had not.
      Response was also independent of age and type of previous antihypertensive
      therapy. In general medical practice, the 30-mg and 60-mg doses of nifedipine
      GITS were both effective and well tolerated and had minimal or no negative
      effects on the overall health status of treated individuals.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of all published randomized, controlled trials
      to assess the risk of cancer or death in patients receiving verapamil for
      hypertension, angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmias. Meta-analysis comparing
      the risk of new cancers, cancer deaths, and all deaths was performed. Thirty-nine
      trials comprising 11,201 patients were eligible. Study durations ranged from 8
      days-6 years (mean 29.5 wks). Nine trials (6507 patients) were 24 weeks in
      duration or longer. For cancer and cancer death, OR was 1.20 (95% CI = 0.60-2.42)
      for verapamil versus active controls and 0.73 (95% CI = 0.39-1.39) for verapamil 
      versus placebo. For all deaths, OR was 1.13 (95% CI = 0.70-1.82) for verapamil
      versus active controls and 0.85 (95% CI = 0.71-1.00) for verapamil versus
      placebo. Sensitivity analysis for the 9 trials 24 weeks' duration or longer gave 
      similar results. There is no statistically significant increased risk of cancer
      or deaths with verapamil compared with active controls or placebo.

TI  - Cardiovascular prognosis in relation to apolipoproteins and other lipid
      parameters in patients with stable angina pectoris treated with verapamil or
      metoprolol: results from the Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm (APSIS).
PG  - 109-18
AB  - Relationships between apolipoproteins and other lipid parameters and
      cardiovascular (CV) prognosis were evaluated in the Angina Prognosis Study In
      Stockholm (APSIS). Out of 809 patients with stable angina pectoris, lipid
      variables were obtained in 786 patients at baseline, and after one month's
      double-blind treatment with metoprolol or verapamil, to evaluate treatment
      effects on these lipid variables. During a median follow-up time of 3.3 years
      (2663 patient years), 37 patients suffered a CV death, 30 suffered a non-fatal
      myocardial infarction (MI) and 100 underwent a revascularization. Apolipoprotein 
      (apo) A-I, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were predictors
      of CV death or non-fatal MI in univariate analyses, but only apo A-I remained as 
      an independent predictor in multivariate analyses. All lipid variables except low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol were related to the risk of revascularization in 
      univariate analyses, but only apo A-I and apo B were independent predictors of
      such events. Triglycerides were weakly, but not independently, associated with
      prognosis. Verapamil and metoprolol had differential short-term effects on
      lipids, with a shift towards a more atherogenic profile in metoprolol treated
      patients. However, there was no significant impact of the treatment given, or of 
      these treatment effects on the risk of CV events. Results of the present study
      suggest that apolipoprotein levels were better predictors of CV events than other
      lipid parameters in patients with stable angina pectoris.

TI  - Assessment of atrioventricular junction ablation and DDDR mode-switching
      pacemaker versus pharmacological treatment in patients with severely symptomatic 
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a randomized controlled study.
PG  - 2617-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of AV junction
      ablation and pacemaker implantation on quality of life and specific symptoms in
      patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) not controlled by drugs.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a multicenter, randomized, 6-month evaluation
      of the clinical effects of AV junction ablation and DDDR mode-switching pacemaker
      (Abl+Pm) versus pharmacological treatment in 43 patients with intolerable,
      recurrent paroxysmal AF of three or more episodes in the previous 6 months not
      controlled with three or more antiarrhythmic drugs. Before completion of the
      study, 3 patients in the drug group withdrew because of the severity of their
      symptoms and 1 patient assigned to the Abl+Pm group in whom the ablation
      procedure failed. At the end of the 6 months, the 21 patients of the Abl+Pm group
      who completed the study showed, in comparison with the 18 of the drug group,
      lower scores in the Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (-51%, P=.0006),
      palpitations (-71%, P=.0000), effort dyspnea (-36%, P=.04), exercise intolerance 
      score (-46%, P=.001), and easy fatigue (-51%, P=.02). The scores for rest
      dyspnea, chest discomfort, and NYHA functional classification were also lower
      (-56%, -50%, and -17%, respectively) in the Abl+Pm group, although not
      significantly. At the end of the study, palpitations were no longer present in
      81% of the Abl+Pm group and in 11% of the drug group (P=.0000). AF was documented
      in 31 of 122 visits (25%) in the Abl+Pm group and in 9 of 107 examinations (8%)
      in the drug group (P=.0005); chronic AF developed in 5 (24%) and 0 (0%) in the
      two groups, respectively (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with paroxysmal AF not
      controlled by pharmacological therapy, Abl+Pm treatment is highly effective and
      superior to drug therapy in controlling symptoms and improving quality of life.
      The discontinuation of drug therapy exposes patients to further recurrences of
      paroxysmal AF and the risk of developing permanent AF.

TI  - Use of calcium channel blockers and breast carcinoma risk in postmenopausal
      women.
PG  - 1438-47
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of calcium channel blockers in an elderly population recently
      was reported to be associated with the incidence of cancer. The Cardiovascular
      Health Study, a multisite observational cohort study, provided the opportunity to
      investigate the epidemiologic association between the use of calcium channel
      blockers and breast carcinoma risk in 3198 women age > or = 65 years. METHODS:
      Standard questionnaires and clinical procedures were administered at four study
      sites annually from 1989-1990 to 1993-1994. Drug usage was assessed by a
      medication inventory and hospitalizations for 75 incident invasive breast
      carcinoma cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases-9 
      Clinical Modification codes. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression
      models were used to assess associations between incident breast carcinoma and the
      use of specific antihypertensive medication including calcium channel blockers.
      RESULTS: In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, an elevated risk of breast 
      carcinoma was associated with use of calcium channel blockers (hazard ratio [HR]:
      2.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-4.49). This association persisted when
      the comparison group was users of other antihypertensive medication. No
      associations between the use of other antihypertensive medication with incident
      breast carcinoma were found. Associations were enhanced by assessment of high
      dose at baseline (HR: 4.42; 95% CI, 1.37-14.27) and when calcium channel blockers
      were combined with estrogen use (HR: 4.48; 95% CI, 1.58-12.75). The association
      was found to be strongest for the use of estrogens with immediate release calcium
      channel blockers (HR: 8.48; 95% CI, 2.99-24.08). CONCLUSIONS: Although the number
      of cases was limited in this observational study, associations found between the 
      use of calcium channel blockers and incident invasive breast carcinoma warrant
      further investigation. Site specific carcinomas should be included as an outcome 
      of ongoing and planned long term clinical trials using calcium channel blockers.

TI  - Combined therapy with benazepril and amlodipine in the treatment of hypertension 
      inadequately controlled by an ACE inhibitor alone.
PG  - 497-503
AB  - In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we
      evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of benazepril, 10 mg, 
      and amlodipine, 2.5 or 5 mg once daily, compared with benazepril, 10 mg,
      monotherapy in patients with hypertension inadequately controlled with
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor monotherapy. After a 2-week placebo
      and 4-week single-blind benazepril, 10 mg once daily, run-in period, 448
      patients, 213 men and 235 women, aged 24-73 years (mean, 55 years), with mean
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or =95 and < or =120 mm Hg at the end of the
      benazepril run-in period, were randomized to receive one of the following
      treatments once daily for 8 weeks: (a) benazepril, 10 mg, plus placebo (BZ10);
      (b) benazepril, 10 mg, plus amlodipine, 2.5 mg (BZ10/AML2.5); or (c) benazepril, 
      10 mg, plus amlodipine, 5 mg (BZ10/AML5). Before the patients were admitted to
      the trial, at the end of the placebo run-in and the benazepril run-in period and 
      at the end of weeks 4 and 8 of the treatment period, sitting and standing blood
      pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and body weight were measured 22-26 h after the
      intake of the trial medication. Both BZ10/AML2.5 and BZ10/AML5 combinations
      showed better antihypertensive activity than did BZ10 monotherapy at the terminal
      visit as demonstrated by (a) the 24-h postdosing sitting and standing systolic BP
      (SBP) and DBP values, which were statistically lower with combination therapy
      than with BZ10; (b) the success rate, which was statistically higher with both
      the combinations (69.2% in the BZ10/AML2.5 and 65.8% in the BZ10/AML5 group)
      compared with the BZ10 group (40.5%). The tolerability was good in the three
      treatment groups. No significant abnormal laboratory data were detected. There
      was no difference in efficacy and safety/tolerability between the BZ10/AML2.5 and
      BZ10/AML5 groups.

TI  - Randomised double-blind comparison of placebo and active treatment for older
      patients with isolated systolic hypertension. The Systolic Hypertension in Europe
      (Syst-Eur) Trial Investigators.
PG  - 757-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolated systolic hypertension occurs in about 15% of people aged 60 
      years or older. In 1989, the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the
      Elderly investigated whether active treatment could reduce cardiovascular
      complications of isolated systolic hypertension. Fatal and non-fatal stroke
      combined was the primary endpoint. METHODS: All patients (> 60 years) were
      initially started on masked placebo. At three run-in visits 1 month apart, their 
      average sitting systolic blood pressure was 160-219 mm Hg with a diastolic blood 
      pressure lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for centre, sex, and previous 
      cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients were randomly assigned to
      nitrendipine 10-40 mg daily, with the possible addition of enalapril 5-20 mg
      daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-25.0 mg daily, or matching placebos. Patients 
      withdrawing from double-blind treatment were still followed up. We compared
      occurrence of major endpoints by intention to treat. FINDINGS: At a median of 2
      years' follow-up, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures had fallen by 13
      mm Hg and 2 mm Hg in the placebo group (n = 2297) and by 23 mm Hg and 7 mm Hg in 
      the active treatment group (n = 2398). The between-group differences were
      systolic 10.1 mm Hg (95% CI 8.8-11.4) and diastolic, 4.5 mm Hg (3.9-5.1). Active 
      treatment reduced the total rate of stroke from 13.7 to 7.9 endpoints per 1000
      patient-years (42% reduction; p = 0.003). Non-fatal stroke decreased by 44% (p = 
      0.007). In the active treatment group, all fatal and non-fatal cardiac endpoints,
      including sudden death, declined by 26% (p = 0.03). Non-fatal cardiac endpoints
      decreased by 33% (p = 0.03) and all fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular endpoints 
      by 31% (p < 0.001). Cardiovascular mortality was slightly lower on active
      treatment (-27%, p = 0.07), but all-cause mortality was not influenced (-14%; p =
      0.22). INTERPRETATION: Among elderly patients with isolated systolic
      hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment starting with nitrendipine reduces 
      the rate of cardiovascular complications. Treatment of 1000 patients for 5 years 
      with this type of regimen may prevent 29 strokes or 53 major cardiovascular
      endpoints.

PG  - 477-81
AB  - A multiple drug regimen consisting of trandolapril, verapamil and
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were sequentially added in an open-label evaluation of
      patients with severe hypertension. Ninety patients (58 white and 32 black
      patients) were titrated on one or more drugs and followed for a 19-week
      maintenance period. Statistically significant (P = 0.001) mean (+/-s.d.)
      decreases in supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 9.0 (+/-9.3) mm Hg for
      trandolapril, 13.9 (+/-11.0) mm Hg for the trandolapril + verapamil (TV)
      combination, and 19.0 (+/-12.3) mm Hg when hydrochlorothiazide was added to the
      combination. The decrease in BP observed on TV combination therapy plus HCTZ was 
      significantly (P = 0.001) greater than the decrease observed for the TV
      combination, which was significantly (P = 0.001) greater than the decrease
      observed for trandolapril monotherapy. Clinical responder rates were 44.8%, 56%
      and 77.7% for trandolapril monotherapy, trandolapril + verapamil combination
      therapy and triple therapy, respectively. Black and white patients had similar
      response rates, but black patients appeared to benefit more from the addition of 
      HCTZ; 20% of black patients achieved a post-treatment supine DBP <90 mm Hg
      compared to 12.8% of white patients. This study demonstrates that the addition of
      verapamil to trandolapril has an additive effect on BP that is maintained
      throughout the day.

TI  - Efficacy of captopril and nifedipine in black and white patients with
      hypertensive crisis.
PG  - 471-6
AB  - We examined the antihypertensive efficacy of: (1) sublingual-oral single doses of
      captopril (25 mg) and nifedipine-capsules (10 mg) in 9 + 9 white patients and in 
      9 + 8 black patients with hypertensive crisis; and (2) a single oral dose of the 
      slow-acting preparation of nifedipine-retard (20 mg) in another 10 black
      patients. Blood pressure (BP) was assessed at 10 min intervals for 6 h after
      administration. After 6 h, the BP falls induced by these drugs were still
      significantly lower than the baseline placebo values. Hypotensive effect of
      nifedipine-capsules was established more rapidly than that of captopril in both
      white and black patients, and of nifedipine-retard in black patients. Considering
      the area under the curve of BP values during the 6-h treatment, the overall
      hypotensive effect of nifedipine-capsules was similar to captopril in white
      patients, but significantly more pronounced than captopril and nifedipine-retard 
      in black patients. In white patients similar maximal drops of BP (mean+/-s.e.m.) 
      were obtained with nifedipine-capsules (71+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) and with captopril
      (69+/-4/50+/-3 mm Hg). In black patients the maximal drop of BP of
      nifedipine-capsules (70+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) was greater (P < 0.02) than that of
      captopril (48+/-4/32+/-3 mm Hg) but similar to that of nifedipine-retard
      (71+/-4/49+/-4 mm Hg). However, in contrast to nifedipine-capsules and captopril,
      nifedipine-retard produced a slower drop in BP. The time of peak drop in BP of
      both nifedipine-capsules and captopril occurred within the first 2 h whereas with
      nifedipine-retard it occurred only between 4 and 6 h after administration. Fewer 
      patients reported side effects with nifedipine-retard as compared with the other 
      two preparations. We conclude that single doses of captopril and nifedipine
      reduces BP for at least 6 h in both white and black patients with hypertensive
      crisis, but nifedipine is more potent than captopril in black patients. The slow 
      release form of nifedipine-retard effectively and safely lowers BP while
      achieving a rapid enough effect without the critical rapid falls in BP that occur
      with nifedipine-capsules.

TI  - A challenge to the concept that the use of calcium channel blockers causes
      reversible male infertility.
PG  - 1480-2
AB  - The objective of this study was retrospectively to evaluate both in-vitro
      fertilization (IVF) and non-IVF cycles in which the male partner had been taking 
      calcium channel blockers, either to confirm or refute previous data from another 
      centre, suggesting that these drugs cause a severe but reversible subfertility
      problem in the male. These drugs were found to inhibit expression of
      mannose-ligand binding receptors, thus preventing spermatozoa from attaching to
      the zona pellucida; they were postulated to cause failed fertilization based on
      one case having this defect, in whom a return to normal was achieved after
      stopping the drug. However, the couple did not undergo a cycle with IVF to see if
      fertilization now occurred. The data presented here demonstrated fertilization in
      all patients having IVF who were taking calcium channel blockers. The subsequent 
      pregnancy rate per transfer was 17.4%. Also, five out of 11 (45.4%) non-IVF
      patients conceived after correction of various female factors. Failure of the
      other six patients to conceive could be explained by other confounding factors,
      especially oligoasthenozoospermia. Taking into consideration other data
      suggesting poor fertilization when this mannose-ligand binding receptor
      abnormality was demonstrated, we propose the possibility that this defect, when
      not associated with calcium channel blockers, may be associated with some other
      cryptic factor that causes poor fertilization. According to our hypothesis,
      calcium channel blockers might cause the problem in mannose expression but also
      adversely affect some other factor that is deficient when non-drug related
      abnormalities in mannose-ligand binding expression are found.

TI  - [Effect of barnidipine hydrochloride on the autonomic nervous system: difference 
      between short- and long-acting components of calcium antagonist].
PG  - 13-8
AB  - Short-acting calcium antagonists have a deleterious effect on the prognosis for
      patients with myocardial ischemia, possibly caused by overactivation of
      sympathetic nerves due to vasodilatation, negative inotropism, or coronary steal.
      However, there is considerable debate about whether long-acting calcium
      antagonists as well as the short-acting calcium antagonists have the same effect.
      Barnidipine-HCl is a newly-developed calcium antagonist with 1:2 short- and
      long-acting particles. This study evaluated the changes of autonomic tone due to 
      barnidipine. Both the short- and long-acting effect of the calcium antagonist was
      evaluated. Eleven patients with primary hypertension underwent 24-hour ambulatory
      electrocardiogram and blood pressure monitoring before and after the treatment
      with barnidipine. Heart rate and blood pressure were compared before and after
      the medication. Heart rate variability was analyzed with a Marquette 8000/T. High
      frequency power (HF), as a parameter of vagal tone, and the ratio to low
      frequency power (LF), as a parameter of sympathetic tone, were obtained.
      Twenty-four-hour average blood pressure decreased significantly during the day,
      but nocturnal hypotension was not observed. Heart rate did not increase. HF
      decreased at the peak of the short- and long-acting components. LF/HF increased
      at the peak of the short-acting component. Short-acting particles of barnidipine 
      had a deleterious effect on the autonomic tone, that is overactivation of
      sympathetic tone and suppression of vagal tone. Long-acting particles of
      barnidipine suppressed the vagal tone. These findings suggest that short-acting
      calcium antagonists may cause arrhythmia or deterioration of coronary ischemia.

TI  - Prevalence of amlodipine-related gingival hyperplasia.
PG  - 676-8
AB  - Calcium channel blockers are known to contribute to gingival hyperplasia. The
      vast majority of reports discuss patients taking the drug nifedipine. During the 
      past few years a newer calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, has been used with
      increasing frequency. To date, six cases have been published indicating that
      amlodipine may also promote gingival hyperplasia; however, no data have been
      reported regarding the prevalence of this phenomenon. The purpose of this study
      was to examine a large group of patients taking amlodipine and determine the
      prevalence of gingival hyperplasia. One hundred fifty dentate patients who had
      been taking amlodipine, 5 mg per day for at least 6 months, volunteered to
      undergo a screening examination for gingival hyperplasia. Mild hyperplasia (< 1/3
      clinical crown) was found in five patients-a prevalence of 3.3%. This is
      significantly less (P < .001) than rates reported for patients taking nifedipine,
      and not significantly different from rates previously reported in control groups 
      of cardiac patients not taking calcium channel blockers. The results from this
      group of patients indicated that amlodipine, 5 mg per day, did not induce
      gingival hyperplasia.

TI  - Regression of nifedipine-induced gingival hyperplasia following switch to a same 
      class calcium channel blocker, isradipine.
PG  - 645-50
AB  - Patients with nifedipine-induced gingival hyperplasia (GH) often require
      continued calcium channel blocker therapy. Switches to diltiazem and verapamil
      have been described; however, these drugs are of a different chemical class and
      present therapeutic limitations in some patients. The purpose of this study was
      to evaluate the effect on nifedipine-induced GH of a switch to a dihydropyridine 
      derivative with a low incidence of GH. Fourteen patients with nifedipine-induced 
      GH were given a medical exam and a periodontal exam. The following parameters
      were assessed: probing depth (PD), gingival margin (GM), gingival thickness (GT),
      plaque index (PI), and gingival index (GI). Intraoral photographs, study models, 
      and a gingival biopsy for histological examination were taken. Following baseline
      measures, patients were randomized to continued treatment with nifedipine or an
      equivalent dose of isradipine in a single-blind fashion. Biweekly periodontal
      parameters were taken for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, some patients elected
      to receive 4 weeks of open label isradipine therapy, with biweekly examination
      continuing through the open label phase. The isradipine treatment arm showed a
      mean decrease in PD of 0.59 mm at week 8 (P < 0.05). No other measured parameter 
      (GM, GT, PI, GI) was significantly changed, compared either to baseline or to the
      alternate treatment arm. Clinically, 60% of patients treated with isradipine
      exhibited a decrease in hyperplasia, while 66% of patients treated with
      nifedipine demonstrated an increase in hyperplasia, a significant difference (P <
      0.05). When combined with open label data, patients switching therapy to
      isradipine exhibited an increase in GM (increase in recession) of 0.74 mm from
      baseline to week 12 (P < 0.05). No patients treated with isradipine exhibited an 
      increase in gingival overgrowth. All patients exhibited adequate control of
      hypertension. We conclude that in hypertensive patients with nifedipine-induced
      GH, switching hypertensive therapy to isradipine may result in a regression of
      GH. When coupled with aggressive oral hygiene treatment, this drug may provide a 
      reasonable option for patients requiring dihydropyridine treatment.

TI  - Comparison of clinical efficacy and adverse effects between extended-release
      felodipine and atenolol in patients with mild and moderate essential
      hypertension.
PG  - 86-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
      Atenolol, a cardio-selective beta-blocker, has been shown to be a safe and
      effective antihypertensive agent. The extended-release form of felodipine
      (felodipine ER), a vascular-selective dihydropyridine calcium blocker, is
      extensively used in Caucasians. However, its effectiveness, tolerability and
      adverse side-effect have not been assessed in Chinese populations. METHODS:
      Sitting blood pressure (BP), heart rate, body weight, adverse reaction and serum 
      biochemistry were assessed in 70 patients with mild-moderate essential
      hypertension treated either with felodipine ER (37 patients), or atenolol (33
      patients) for 10 weeks. Each patient was prescribed 5 mg of felodipine ER or 50
      mg of atenolol once daily and this daily dosage was doubled to twice daily if
      necessary. RESULTS: Six patients who received felodipine ER and 3 who received
      atenolol withdrew from the treatment because of intolerable side effects. Within 
      ten weeks, 81.1% of the patients had responded to a total daily dosage of 5-10 mg
      of felodipine ER and 81.8% to a daily dose of 50-100 mg of atenolol. By the end
      of treatment, the mean BP in the felodipine ER group had decreased from 176/104
      mmHg at baseline to 145/85 mmHg, while the BP in the atenolol group had dropped
      from 173/103 mmHg to 145/84 mmHg (NS between the two groups). Heart rate declined
      in the atenolol group but did not change in patients who received felodipine ER. 
      Overall, patients in the felodipine ER group had a higher rate of adverse
      reaction (70.3% vs. 39.4%; p < 0.001), and 16.2% of the patients in the
      felodipine ER group experienced symptoms of hypotension. CONCLUSION: Equivalent
      doses of felodipine ER and atenolol are effective first-line monotherapeutic
      agents for the treatment of mild-moderate essential hypertension.

      long-acting calcium antagonists with similar efficacy but different tolerability 
      profiles. Mibefradil International Study Group.
PG  - 387-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of mibefradil and amlodipine 
      in patients with uncomplicated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. DESIGN: A
      double-blind, randomised, parallel group multicentre trial. METHODS: 239 patients
      received 50 mg mibefradil or 5 mg amlodipine for 4 weeks, followed by a forced
      titration to 100 mg mibefradil or 10 mg amlodipine for an additional 8 weeks.
      Patients then entered a 4-week withdrawal period either on therapy or switched to
      placebo. RESULTS: Statistically equivalent reductions in trough sitting diastolic
      blood pressure (SDBP) were observed after 12 weeks of once-daily treatment with
      50/100 mg mibefradil (-11.5 +/- 8.2 mm Hg) and 5/10 mg amlodipine (-13.2 +/- 7.9 
      mm Hg). The number of patients with normalised SDBP (< or = 90 mm Hg) increased
      23.3% in the mibefradil group and 19.5% in the amlodipine group (approximately
      74% in both groups). Patients on mibefradil or amlodipine during the withdrawal
      period had significantly larger decreases in SDBP than those on placebo. Patients
      on mibefradil had a decrease in heart rate of 5.5 bpm. Patients on amlodipine had
      no change in heart rate; however, cessation of amlodipine was associated with a
      decrease in heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Mibefradil was as effective as amlodipine in
      reducing BP; both compounds were effective treatments of hypertension.

TI  - Short-acting nifedipine and diltiazem do not reduce the incidence of cardiac
      events in patients with healed myocardial infarction. Secondary Prevention Group.
PG  - 2368-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: The administration of calcium antagonists to patients with healed
      myocardial infarction is a controversial treatment. This study was conducted to
      elucidate the effect of short-acting nifedipine and diltiazem on cardiac events
      in patients with healed myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: A controlled 
      clinical open trial of 1115 patients with healed myocardial infarction was
      carried out between 1986 and 1994. The patients included 595 who received no
      calcium antagonist, 341 who received short-acting nifedipine 30 mg/d, and 179 who
      received short-acting diltiazem 90 mg/d. The primary end points were cardiac
      events, which were defined as fatal or nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction; 
      death from congestive heart failure; sudden death; and hospitalization because of
      worsening angina, congestive heart failure, or premature ventricular
      contractions. Cardiac events occurred in 51 patients (8.6%) in the
      no-calcium-antagonist group and 54 (10.4%) in the calcium-antagonist group (odds 
      ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.85), demonstrating that the calcium antagonists
      did not reduce the incidence of cardiac events. Subgroup analysis revealed no
      beneficial effects of these drugs for reducing cardiac events in patients with
      such complications as hypertension or angina pectoris. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      showed that use of short-acting nifedipine and diltiazem in this postmyocardial
      infarction population was associated with a 24% higher cardiac event rate, but
      this strong adverse trend did not reach statistical significance.

TI  - Therapy in old patients with isolated systolic hypertension: fourth progress
      report on the Syst-Eur trial.
PG  - 263-9
AB  - The Syst-Eur trial is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      therapeutical trial in patients at least 60 years old and with isolated systolic 
      hypertension. Its scope is to investigate the effects of modern antihypertensive 
      drug treatment on morbidity and mortality and to assess possible adverse effects 
      of the drugs used. Patients were recruited in 22 countries in western and eastern
      Europe and Israel. At three run-in visits 1 month apart their sitting systolic
      blood pressure (SBP) on single-blind placebo treatment averaged 180-219 mm Hg
      with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for
      sex and the presence of cardiovascular complications, the patients were
      randomized either to active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consisted of
      nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day)
      and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), titrated or combined to reduce the
      sitting SBP by at least 20 mm Hg to below 150 mm Hg. Matching placebos were
      employed similarly. The present progress report is based on the data received at 
      the Coordinating Office before 1 March 1996. At that time 3433 subjects had been 
      randomized. A total of 2015 patients had been followed for at least 1 year on
      double-blind treatment and 1298 patients for at least 2 years. At baseline BP was
      similar in both treatment groups and averaged 174/86 mm Hg. According to a
      per-protocol analysis at 1 year, BP fell (P < 0.001) on average by 22.6 +/-
      15.7/6.0 +/- 8.0 mm Hg in the active treatment group and by 12.2 +/- 15.9/1.7 +/-
      7.3 mm Hg in the placebo group. At 2 years BP was 10.2/5.7 mm Hg lower (P <
      0.001) on active treatment than on placebo. At 1 year the percentage of patients 
      who had reached goal BP was 19.9% in the placebo group and 41.4% in the active
      treatment group. At 2 years these percentages were 20.9 and 43.2 respectively.

TI  - Nifedipine interaction with tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients.
PG  - 571-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the possible drug interaction between nifedipine and
      tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study
      was done comparing two groups of liver transplant recipients. The starting time
      for comparison was the same after transplant. One group (n = 22) consisted of
      hypertensive patients who were treated with nifedipine; the other group (n = 28) 
      did not receive nifedipine. The two groups were compared over 1 year. The effect 
      of nifedipine on tacrolimus was measured in terms of tacrolimus whole blood
      trough concentrations, daily tacrolimus dosages, and cumulative tacrolimus
      dosages at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. All patient charts were reviewed with regard
      to concurrent medication that could affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and
      eventually affect tacrolimus concentrations and dosages. DATA COLLECTION: All
      required information was retrieved from medical records. RESULTS: There was a
      statistically significant difference between daily dosage requirements of
      tacrolimus at 90 (p = 0.03), 180 (p = 0.004), and 365 (p = 0.0004) days between
      the nifedipine and no-nifedipine groups. The tacrolimus daily dosage in the
      nifedipine group was decreased by 26%, 29%, and 38% at 3, 6, and 12 months,
      respectively, compared with the dosage of the no-nifedipine group. Statistically 
      significant differences in cumulative dosages of tacrolimus were observed at 180 
      (p = 0.02) and 365 (p = 0.003) days between the nifedipine and no-nifedipine
      groups, with cumulative dosage reduction of 25% and 31% by 6 and 12 months,
      respectively, in the nifedipine group compared with the no-nifedipine group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Nifedipine decreased the daily and cumulative dosage requirement of 
      tacrolimus. The interaction observed between nifedipine and tacrolimus is the
      first reported in humans and is clinically important. As a result of this drug
      interaction, it is recommended that blood concentrations of tacrolimus be
      monitored during coadministration of these drugs and that the tacrolimus dosage
      be adjusted accordingly.

TI  - Effects of diltiazem versus digoxin on dysrhythmias and cardiac function after
      pneumonectomy.
PG  - 1374-81; discussion 1381-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: This prospective study was designed to determine whether diltiazem is
      superior to digoxin for the prophylaxis of supraventricular dysrhythmias (SVD)
      after pneumonectomy or extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) and to assess the
      influence of these drugs on perioperative cardiac function. METHODS: Seventy
      consecutive patients without previous SVD were randomly allocated immediately
      after pneumonectomy or EPP to receive diltiazem (n = 35) or digoxin (n = 35).
      Diltiazem-treated patients received a slow intravenous loading dose of 20 mg,
      followed by 10 mg intravenously every 4 hours for 24 to 36 hours, then 180 to 240
      mg orally daily for 1 month. Digoxin-treated patients received a 1-mg intravenous
      loading in the first 24 to 36 hours, then 0.125 to 0.25 mg orally daily for 1
      month. A concurrent prospective cohort of 40 patients without previous SVD, who
      did not participate in the study and underwent pneumonectomy or EPP without
      prophylaxis, served as a comparison group for SVD occurrence. Serial Doppler
      echocardiograms were performed to assess cardiac function and all patients were
      continuously monitored with Holter recorders for 3 days. Data were analyzed by
      intent-to-treat. RESULTS: In patients undergoing standard or intrapericardial
      pneumonectomy, diltiazem prevented the overall incidence of postoperative SVD
      when compared with digoxin, 0 of 21 patients versus 8 of 25 patients,
      respectively, p < 0.005. When EPP patients were included in the analysis,
      diltiazem decreased the incidence of all SVD from 11 of 35 patients (31%) to 5 of
      35 patients (14%) when compared with digoxin, p = 0.09. Digoxin-treated patients 
      had a similar incidence of all SVD (31%) as concurrent controls (11 of 40
      patients [28%]). The two treated groups did not differ in right or left atrial
      size, left ventricular ejection fraction, or right heart pressure. When all
      patients were combined, those in whom SVD developed were significantly older (65 
      +/- 12 years versus 55 +/- 11 years, p = 0.004) and had a longer median hospital 
      stay (9 versus 6 days, p = 0.03), when compared with those in whom SVD did not
      develop, respectively. The subset of patients undergoing EPP had a greater
      incidence of atrial fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of
      postoperative pericarditis than all other pneumonectomy patients. CONCLUSIONS:
      Diltiazem was both safe and more effective than digoxin in reducing the overall
      incidence of SVD after standard or intrapericardial pneumonectomy. Digoxin
      therapy had no effect on the incidence of postoperative SVD and is not
      recommended for prophylaxis of SVD. Dysrhythmias after pneumonectomy or EPP occur
      in older patients and are associated with a greater length of hospital stay.

TI  - [Effectiveness and tolerability of bisoprolol vs. nifedipine in uremic patients
      with ischemic cardiopathy in dialysis treatment].
PG  - 397-403
AB  - The effects of bisoprolol on transient myocardial ischemia have been compared
      with those of nifedipine in patients with coronary artery disease in end-stage
      renal failure maintained on haemodialysis. We also evaluated the tolerability of 
      both drugs. Sixty patients (42 males, 18 females, mean age 52 +/- 4 years) in
      renal failure maintained on haemodialysis, with coronary artery disease and more 
      than four significant episodes of transient myocardial ischemia (> or = 1 min)
      during 48-hour Holter monitoring, were included in the study. All cardiovascular 
      drugs were discontinued > or = 6 days before this 48-hour ambulatory ECG
      monitoring, with the exception of sublingual nitrates allowed for relief of
      anginal attacks. Patients were then randomized to receive either bisoprolol or
      nifedipine for 2 weeks. After a 15-day wash-out period, they were crossed over to
      receive either bisoprolol or nifedipine for other 2 weeks. Statistical analysis
      was carried out using the Student's t test. A p value < 0.01 was considered
      significant. Both bisoprolol and nifedipine reduced number and duration of
      transient ischemic episodes as well as the total ischemic burden. Reductions were
      statistically significant for both antianginal drugs. Only bisoprolol was
      effective in silent ischemia (p < 0.001). It also reduced heart rate (p < 0.001),
      while nifedipine raised it (p < 0.001). Both drugs reduced systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure. The circadian variations of transient ischemic episodes showed
      two peaks in the 24 hours. Both peaks were reduced with bisoprolol. Nifedipine
      brought a clear overall reduction in the number of episodes but the circadian
      pattern was unchanged. During the study, 10 patients taking bisoprolol and 12
      patients taking nifedipine had drug adverse effects. No one of them had to be
      withdrawn from treatment. In conclusion, bisoprolol seems to be more useful than 
      nifedipine because its effects, in transient ischemic episodes, are greatly
      superior to those of nifedipine, and because it is effective also in silent
      ischemia. Both drugs showed a good tolerability in these patients. Bisoprolol,
      reducing the two daily peaks of ischemic episodes frequency, has a protective
      role towards mortality due to coronary artery disease.

TI  - Diltiazem, a calcium antagonist, partly attenuates the effects of
      dextroamphetamine in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 113-20
AB  - Calcium antagonists have previously been shown to be effective in the treatment
      of mania. In the present study we used dextroamphetamine administered to humans
      as a model of mania, to determine whether the calcium antagonist diltiazem would 
      prevent dextroamphetamine-induced changes. This may help determine whether
      diltiazem is likely to be useful in the treatment of mania. Ten healthy
      volunteers were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced
      crossover study. Subjects received either oral diltiazem (60 mg) and placebo,
      placebo and dextroamphetamine (20 mg), diltiazem and dextroamphetamine, or
      placebo alone. Subjective and sleep changes were measured using visual analogue
      scales. Attentiveness and visual reaction times were measured repeatedly as were 
      diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The results showed that dextroamphetamine 
      alone produced a number of subjective changes, cardiovascular changes and changes
      in reaction time. Diltiazem significantly attenuated the cardiovascular changes, 
      but not the subjective or reaction time changes. It is hypothesized that these
      findings may represent effects of diltiazem on noradrenergic neurotransmission.
      The results are tentatively supportive of suggestions that diltiazem may be
      clinically useful in the treatment of mania, as is another calcium channel
      antagonist, verapamil.

TI  - Effect of calcium channel or beta-blockade on the progression of diabetic
      nephropathy in African Americans.
PG  - 744-50
AB  - beta-Blockers are known to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy by
      lowering arterial pressure. Moreover, in individuals with diabetic nephropathy,
      antihypertensive agents that provide sustained reductions in proteinuria slow the
      rate of decline in renal function compared with agents without this
      antiproteinuric effect. To examine whether differential effects on proteinuria
      affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy, we conducted a randomized study
      that compared the effects of a heart rate-lowering calcium channel blocker,
      sustained-release verapamil, with those of a beta-blocker, atenolol, on the
      progression of diabetic renal disease. The primary end point of the study was a
      change in creatinine clearance slope. Thirty-four African Americans with the
      following inclusion criteria were randomized to one of the two groups: serum
      creatinine greater than 1.4 mg/dL, proteinuria greater than 1500 mg/d, longer
      than a 5-year history of both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and
      hypertension, and exclusion of other renal diseases. Goal blood pressure was less
      than 140/90 mm Hg. All subjects received loop diuretics as second line agents to 
      help achieve the blood pressure goal. Twenty-four-hour urinary protein and sodium
      excretions as well as creatinine clearance were measured at 6-month intervals.
      Blood pressure was measured every 3 months. After a mean follow-up of 54+/-6
      months, the calcium channel blocker group demonstrated both a slower rate of
      decline in creatinine clearance (-1.7+/-0.9 versus -3.7+/-1.4 mL/min per year per
      1.73 m2, P<.01) and a greater reduction in proteinuria compared with the atenolol
      group. Additionally, a greater proportion of the atenolol group had a 50% or more
      increase in serum creatinine compared with the verapamil group (32+/-9% versus
      16+/-7%, P<.05). These between-group differences could not be explained by
      differences in blood pressure control. These data support the concept that
      antihypertensive agents that persistently maintain reductions in both arterial
      pressure and proteinuria slow the progression of diabetic renal disease in
      African Americans to a greater extent than those agents without these effects.

PG  - 597-601
AB  - Calcium antagonists are widely used in therapy of hypertension and angina
      pectoris. Their advantage is good efficacy, relatively few and not dangerous side
      effects and first of all lack of bad metabolic effects (hypokalemia,
      hyperuricemia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipoproteinemia). In contrast to
      beta-blockers and diuretics, which decline mortality from myocardial infarctions 
      and strokes there are not similar information concerning calcium antagonists. Two
      meta-analysis from 1995 unexpectedly suggest, that some preparations of calcium
      antagonists increase mortality from myocardial infarctions and strokes. In our
      paper we discuss possible pathogenetic (harmful) mechanisms, pay attention to
      each class of calcium antagonists and time of action of the particular drugs.
      Short acting nifedipine formulation should be withdrawn from chronic hypertension
      and angina pectoris therapy. Ongoing multicenter trials in several European
      countries and in USA will decide the usefulness of other calcium antagonists
      preparations.

      of nisoldipine therapy. Results of the DEFIANT-II Study. The DEFIANT-II Research 
      Group.
PG  - 31-40
AB  - AIMS: A multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 542 
      patients, randomized 7-10 days after myocardial infarction, to study the effect
      of nisoldipine coat-core (nisoldipine-CC) on exercise after 6 months. Secondary
      endpoints included exercise-induced ischaemia, left ventricular function measured
      by Doppler echocardiography, adverse cardiac events and clinical outcome. METHODS
      AND RESULTS: Patients had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction between 25
      and 50%, but no heart failure. Exercise time was not different in the two groups.
      Nisoldipine-CC prolonged time to 1 mm ST deviation (P = 0.03). There was an
      effect of nisoldipine-CC of +3.6 cm.s-1 on early peak velocity (P = 0.01) and of 
      -6.2 ms on isovolumic relaxation time (P = 0.005), but no effects on left
      ventricular volumes or ejection fraction. There was a trend towards reduced
      mortality (one death in the nisoldipine-CC group vs seven in the placebo group. P
      < 0.07) and the combined end-point of mortality and cardiac events (P = 0.09).
      Peripheral oedema occurred in 49 patients assigned to nisoldipine-CC and two
      assigned to placebo (P < 0.001). There were no differences in non-cardiac events.
      CONCLUSIONS: Nisoldipine-CC did not improve exercise time but increased time to 1
      mm ST deviation, and improved diastolic left ventricular function. It is safe and
      well tolerated in post-infarction patients with impaired left ventricular
      function.

TI  - Hypertension in Diabetes Study IV. Therapeutic requirements to maintain tight
      blood pressure control.
PG  - 1554-61
AB  - We report the efficacy of therapy over 5 years follow-up in 758
      non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients in a prospective, randomised controlled
      study of therapy of mild hypertension. Patients were recruited who on
      antihypertensive therapy had systolic blood pressure over 150 mmHg or diastolic
      over 85 mmHg, or if not on therapy had systolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg or
      diastolic over 90 mmHg. Their mean blood pressure at entry to the study was
      160/94 mmHg at a mean age of 57 years. They were allocated to tight control
      (aiming for systolic < 150/diastolic < 85 mmHg) or to less tight control (aiming 
      for systolic < 180/diastolic < 105 mmHg). The tight control group were allocated 
      to primary therapy either with a beta blocker (atenolol) or with an antiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), with addition of other agents as
      required. Over 5 years, the mean blood pressure in the tight control group was
      significantly lower (143/82 vs 154/88 mmHg, p < 0.001). No difference was seen
      between those allocated to atenolol or captopril. The proportion of patients
      requiring three or more antihypertensive therapies to maintain tight control in
      those allocated to atenolol or captopril increased from 16 and 15%, respectively 
      at 2 years to 25 and 26%, respectively at 5 years, whereas in the less tight
      control group at 2 and 5 years only 5 and 7%, respectively required three or more
      therapies. There was no difference in the incidence of side effects or
      hypoglycaemic episodes between those allocated to atenolol or captopril, but
      those allocated to atenolol increased their body weight by a mean of 2.3 kg
      compared with 0.5 kg in those allocated to captopril (p < 0.01). Allocation to
      atenolol was also associated with small increases in triglyceride, and decreases 
      in LDL and HDL cholesterol, which are of uncertain clinical relevance. The study 
      is continuing to determine whether the improved blood pressure control, which was
      obtained, will be beneficial in maintaining the health of patients by decreasing 
      the incidence of major clinical complications, principally myocardial infarction 
      and strokes, and microvascular complications, such as severe retinopathy
      requiring photocoagulation and deterioration of renal function.

TI  - Hyperprolactinaemia and verapamil: prevalence and potential association with
      hypogonadism in men.
PG  - 571-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Verapamil has been associated with hyperprolactinaemia, but there have
      been no population-based studies. Our objective was to determine the prevalence
      and degree of hyperprolactinaemia associated with verapamil in the clinical
      setting. DESIGN: Observation with cross-sectional and longitudinal components in 
      the setting of an urban teaching hospital and its satellite out-patient clinics. 
      PATIENTS: Male out-patients excluding those taking other drugs known to raise
      PRL, renal failure and known primary hypothyroidism (1265 eligible subjects).
      Control subjects were drawn from eligible out-patients not taking verapamil.
      MEASUREMENTS: Serum PRL levels, frequency of persistent hyperprolactinaemia and
      total testosterone levels. RESULTS: Prolactin levels were obtained in 449
      subjects on verapamil (35.5% response rate) and 166 controls. The proportions of 
      individuals with hyperprolactinaemia (PRL > 460 mU/l) were 0.085 and 0.030 in the
      verapamil and control groups, respectively (P = 0.012, X2-test). The mean (+/-
      SD) serum PRL levels were 267 +/- 205 and 203 +/- 118 mU/l in the verapamil and
      control groups, respectively (P < 0.001, independent t-test). Of the 38 patients 
      with previously determined elevated PRL levels, follow-up data were obtained in
      25 (65.8%); one was found to have a pituitary adenoma and was excluded from the
      analysis. Fifteen of the 24 were still on verapamil (Group 1) and 14 (93.3%)
      continued to be hyperprolactinaemic. In 9 patients verapamil had been
      discontinued (Group 2) and all had normal PRL levels. Continued verapamil use was
      associated with persistent hyperprolactinaemia (odds ratio > 120, P < 0.00001).
      The mean +/- SD serum testosterone levels at follow-up were significantly lower
      in Group 1 (6.16 +/- 2.52 nmol/l) than in Group 2 (9.42 +/- 3.92 nmol/l, P =
      0.029, independent t-test). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia
      associated with verapamil use in this study of male out-patients was 8.5% (95% CI
      5.9-11.1%). The persistence of hyperprolactinaemia when verapamil was continued
      (Group 1) and the return to normal PRL levels when verapamil was discontinued
      (Group 2) confirm verapamil's causal role in the development of
      hyperprolactinaemia. While low testosterone levels were common in both groups,
      testosterone levels were lower in patients on verapamil. Our data suggest that
      screening for hyperprolactinaemia should be considered in male patients taking
      verapamil.

TI  - Final outcome results of the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis
      Study (MIDAS). A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 785-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the rate of progression of mean maximum intimal-medial
      thickness (IMT) in carotid arteries, using quantitative B-mode ultrasound
      imaging, during antihypertensive therapy with isradipine vs hydrochlorothiazide. 
      DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled trial. SETTING: Nine
      medical center clinics. POPULATION: A total of 883 patients with baseline mean
      +/- SD systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) of 149.7
      +/- 16.6 and 96.5 +/- 5.1 mm Hg, age of 58.5 +/- 8.5 years, and maximum IMT of
      1.17 +/- 0.20 mm. INTERVENTIONS: Twice daily doses of isradipine (2.5-5.0 mg) or 
      hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE (PRIMARY END POINT): Rate 
      of progression of mean maximum IMT in 12 carotid focal points over 3 years.
      RESULTS: There was no difference in the rate of progression of mean maximum IMT
      between isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide over 3 years (P=.68). There was a
      higher incidence of major vascular events (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke,
      congestive heart failure, angina, and sudden death) in isradipine (n=25; 5.65%)
      vs hydrochlorothiazide (n=14; 3.17%) (P=.07), and a significant increase in
      nonmajor vascular events and procedures (eg, transient ischemic attack,
      dysrhythmia, aortic valve replacement, and femoral popliteal bypass graft) in
      isradipine (n=40; 9.05%) vs hydrochlorothiazide (n=23; 5.22%) (P=.02). At 6
      months, mean DBP decreased by 13.0 mm Hg in both groups, and mean SBP decreased
      by 19.5 mm Hg in hydrochlorothiazide and 16.0 mm Hg in isradipine (P=.002); the
      difference in SBP between the 2 groups persisted throughout the study but did not
      explain the increased incidence of vascular events in patients treated with
      isradipine. CONCLUSION: The rate of progression of mean maximum IMT in carotid
      arteries, the surrogate end point in this study, did not differ between the 2
      treatment groups. The increased incidence of vascular events in patients
      receiving isradipine compared with hydrochlorothiazide is of concern and should
      be studied further.

      moderately severe arterial hypertension].
PG  - 1081-6
AB  - In the present double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 36 untreated
      patients (57.8 +/- 8.4 years) with mild to moderate hypertension were included.
      After a 14 days' placebo period they were treated with a combination of 20 mg
      retarded nifedipine and 25 or 50 mg atenolol for six weeks each. Group A started 
      with 25 mg, group B with 50 mg atenolol. Casual sitting blood pressure was
      measured automatically every second week, routine laboratory parameters and side 
      effects were evaluated at the end of placebo and the verum periods. The blood
      pressure of the two groups was comparable during placebo and was reduced by
      31.6/14.7 mmHg in group A or 29.9/15.8 mmHg in group B (p < 0.001 vs. placebo)
      after six weeks. In the second treatment period with verum, blood pressure was
      not further reduced. Both combinations were equally efficient also in the female 
      and the elder subgroups (> 60 years) who were characterized by higher systolic
      blood pressure. The response rates were 83% and 86% for the combination with 25
      and 50 mg atenolol respectively. Heart rate was significantly reduced in all
      groups during 50 mg atenolol. Laboratory parameters were not altered by
      treatment. Frequency and severeness of side effects were equal in both groups. It
      is concluded that in patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension
      the combination of 20 mg retarded nifedipine with 25 mg atenolol is equally
      efficient to the combination with 50 mg atenolol.

TI  - Long-term survival after myocardial infarction: relationship with thrombolysis
      and discharge medication. Results of the Augsburg Myocardial Infarction Follow-up
      Study 1985 to 1993.
PG  - 1199-206
AB  - A large number of randomized clinical trials have shown that thrombolysis,
      long-term treatment with beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitors improve survival after acute myocardial infarction
      (AMI). However, for calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, diltiazem, and
      verapamil) there was either no benefit, or positive effects have been reported in
      subgroups only. Recent studies have raised concern about the safety of this drug 
      class, especially in patients with coronary heart disease. We studied the
      long-term survival, for a median follow-up time of 4.4 years, of 1197
      non-diabetic patients in the population-based AMI registry in Augsburg, Germany, 
      aged 25-74 years, who had survived a first Q wave acute myocardial infarction for
      at least 28 days. The impact of thrombolysis and prescribed medication at
      discharge (beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and calcium channel blockers) on
      long-term survival was analysed using the Cox-Proportional-Hazard model,
      controlling for age, sex, and concomitant cardiac drug use. Thrombolysis (risk
      ratio, RR, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.48-1.08), long-term beta-blockade
      (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.36-0.74) and antiplatelet drug use (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.94)
      were associated with considerable reductions in total mortality. The use of
      calcium channel blockers was not associated with a reduction in total mortality
      (RR 1.23; 95% CI 0.89-1.69). Separate analyses for nifedipine (RR 1.00; 95% CI
      0.68-1.48), and diltiazem (RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.04-2.32) showed an increased risk of
      death associated with the latter. Using patients on beta-blockers only (RR 1.00) 
      as a reference, the prescription of these calcium channel blockers was
      consistently associated with an increased total mortality (nifedipine, without
      beta-blockers RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.12-3.57, diltiazem, without beta-blockers RR
      2.87; 95% CI 1.75-4.70). These results from an observational study demonstrate a 
      benefit of thrombolysis, beta-adrenergic blockade and antiplatelet drug use on
      long-term survival in acute myocardial infarction patients. Calcium channel
      blocker use appears to be associated with an increased risk of death. These data 
      support the need for controlled trials to address this issue specifically.

      respectively. A safe DBP of < or = 110 mm Hg (Kaplan) was achieved in 90, 61,
      72.2 and 95.2 percent of patients. A statistically significant fall in DBP was
      observed at 5 minutes with all regimens except CAP which was at 15 minutes. Mild 
      side effects observed were palpitations and flushing (NIF n = 4), taste
      disturbances (CAP n = 3), heaviness of head (CAP n = 1) and giddiness (MET n = 2,
      NIF + MET n = 2). The trial data suggest that hypertensive crisis can be managed,
      without intensive care facility, with all four regimens; this implies significant
      cost containment.

TI  - Double-blind, parallel, comparative multicentre study of a new combination of
      diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide with individual components in patients with
      mild or moderate hypertension.
PG  - 443-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a new
      combination preparation of diltiazem (150 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg)
      with the individual constituents in patients with mild/moderate hypertension.
      DESIGN: Multi-centre, double-blind, randomised parallel group study. PATIENTS:
      Seventy-one patients with essential hypertension were recruited to the study.
      TREATMENT: Following completion of the placebo run-in period 63 patients
      fulfilled the prerandomisation criteria and entered the 10 week treatment period.
      Patients were randomised to receive either the combination preparation (D 150
      mg/H 12.5 mg), diltiazem (150 mg) or hydrochlorthiazide (12.5 mg). The dosage was
      increased in three patients who had not attained target blood pressure (BP)
      control after 6 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Response to treatment assessed by change
      from baseline in clinic and 24 h ambulatory BP. RESULTS: The proportion of
      patients achieving target BP (a reduction in resting supine diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP) to below 90 mm Hg or a reduction of 10 mm Hg from baseline) was
      80% in the combination group, 55% in the diltiazem group, and 38% in the
      hydrochlorothiazide group. The respective figures for reduction in supine DBP
      from baseline were 13.5 mm Hg, 11.2 mm Hg and 5.9 mm Hg. A similar treatment
      order appeared throughout each of the efficacy variables. BP control throughout
      the 24 h dosing interval was demonstrated by ambulatory BP monitoring. Each
      treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: This study provides clear evidence of
      the efficacy of combination therapy with diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide in the
      management of patients with hypertension.

TI  - Evaluation of gingival and periodontal conditions following causal periodontal
      treatment in patients treated with nifedipine and diltiazem.
PG  - 649-57
AB  - It is established that phenytoin, cyclosporin and some calcium antagonists
      produce gingival overgrowth, but it is not known how this condition may respond
      to causal periodontal treatment. In order to find out, a longitudinal study was
      carried out, over a year, comparing a group of patients who were given nifedipine
      (NG, n = 18) and another group who were given diltiazem (DG, n = 13) with 2
      others: one comprised cardiopathic patients who took no calcium antagonists (CG, 
      n = 12) and the other contained patients who were medically healthy, with
      moderate periodontitis (HG, n = 12). On their basal visit, they were examined and
      instructed in oral hygiene, and then given causal periodontal treatment, being
      seen again at 4 and 8 months, when hygiene instructions were reinforced. They
      were seen for the last time at 12 months, when they were again examined. Groups
      NG and DG, on their basal visit, showed larger gum size than groups HG and CG,
      which was statistically significant; on their final visit, these differences
      remained only at the interproximal level. The number of patients with gingival
      overgrowth-taking the average of group HG as a minimal value-was much higher in
      groups CG (92%), DG (100%) and NG (89%) on the basal visit; on the final visit,
      the differences remained only in groups DG (85%) and NG (83%). The probing pocket
      depth reduction was much greater in groups HG and CG than in DG and NG, basically
      due to a greater gaining on clinical attachment level. The % of sites in which
      the pocket depth improved by more than 2 mm was 39.8% in HG, 54.5% in CG, 23.7%
      in DG and 28.7% in NG. The % of sites where the attachment gain by more than 2 mm
      was 46.2% in HG, 55.5% in CG, 22.8% in DG and 21.4% in NG. The amount of plaque
      and bleeding on probing, which was similar in all groups on the basal visit,
      decreased throughout the study, especially between the basal and 2nd visit in
      groups HG and CG. We have demonstrated that patients that take nifedipine and
      diltiazem show a larger gum size and their response to causal periodontal
      treatment is poorer than in the healthy and the cardiac groups.

TI  - New antiherpesvirus agents. Their targets and therapeutic potential.
PG  - 17-32
AB  - Of the large number of agents under development for the treatment of herpes virus
      infections [herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), varicella
      zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)], only ten
      have apparently reached clinical development. Aciclovir was approved for the
      treatment of HSV infections over 10 years ago, and it remains an important and
      reliable antiviral agent. Recent approvals in some countries of valaciclovir for 
      VZV infection and famciclovir for both HSV and VZV infections demonstrate the
      rapidity of change in this field. Intravenous ganciclovir and foscarnet are
      approved for the treatment of CMV infection in the immunocompromised patient.
      Five of the antiherpetic drugs under current clinical development are nucleoside 
      analogues or their prodrugs; another is a phosphorylated nucleoside (nucleotide).
      Four of the nucleoside agents-penciclovir, famciclovir, valaciclovir and
      lobucavir-are being developed for the management of HSV and VZV infections.
      Valaciclovir is also being developed for the prevention of CMV infections and
      famciclovir and lobucavir for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infection. Oral 
      ganciclovir, lobucavir, ISIS 2922 and cidofovir are being developed for the
      suppression of CMV infections in immunocompromised patients. Sorivudine has been 
      studied in VZV infections. n-Docosanol is under development for HSV infections,
      and cidofovir is being developed for both HSV and CMV infections, as well as for 
      treatment of other viral diseases. Traditionally, the adverse effects associated 
      with anti-CMV compounds have been more difficult to manage and are acceptable
      clinically only because of the severity of the underlying infection and lack of
      safer therapeutic alternatives. In general, toxicity issues continue to be
      problematic in the anti-CMV arena, although newer agents have improved the
      situation to some extent. In contrast, the safety of anti-HSV compounds has
      traditionally been excellent, establishing a safety standard that must be met by 
      newer agents entering the field.

TI  - Nisoldipine versus isosorbide dinitrate in coronary heart disease: results of a
      double-masked study.
PG  - 448-59
AB  - The efficacy and tolerability of a twice-daily dose of 5 mg of nisoldipine versus
      40 mg of sustained-release isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) were compared in a
      randomized, double-masked study in 91 patients. During the 21-day treatment
      period, the mean time taken during bicycle ergometry to the appearance of an ST
      segment depression of at least 0.1 mV compared with the resting value increased
      from 287 +/- 129 seconds to 391 +/- 150 seconds in the nisoldipine group and from
      254 +/- 140 seconds to 350 +/- 191 seconds in the ISDN group. The mean value at
      the end of treatment calculated by using analysis of covariance was 383 seconds
      in both groups. The difference between the two treatment groups was not
      statistically significant. The mean ST segment depression at individually maximal
      workload decreased from 0.19 +/- 0.07 mV to 0.12 +/- 0.08 mV in the nisoldipine
      group and from 0.18 +/- 0.07 mV to 0.14 +/- 0.08 mV in the ISDN group. The mean
      total duration of exercise increased from 420 +/- 161 seconds to 497 +/- 140
      seconds in the nisoldipine group and from 425 +/- 167 seconds to 456 +/- 168
      seconds in the ISDN group. In the nisoldipine group, 9 patients reported 12
      adverse events that were considered to be possibly or probably related to the
      test medication; in the ISDN group, 13 patients reported 26 adverse events.
      Although the anti-ischemic effect of the two treatments was comparable,
      nisoldipine was descriptively superior to ISDN in terms of tolerability.

TI  - Efficacy, tolerability, and quality of life of losartan, alone or with
      hydrochlorothiazide, versus nifedipine GITS in patients with essential
      hypertension.
PG  - 411-28
AB  - A randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial was
      conducted to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and effects on quality of life
      associated with the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan, alone or with
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker
      nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) in patients whose sitting
      diastolic blood pressure measurements were between 95 and 115 mm Hg, inclusive,
      while receiving placebo. Patients were randomized to receive either losartan or
      nifedipine GITS in a double-masked, double-dummy fashion. A 4-week placebo
      washout period established baseline untreated blood pressure measurements and was
      followed by a 12-week active treatment period. Patients receiving losartan (n =
      110) were initially given 50 mg once a day (QD) and could be titrated to
      losartan/HCTZ 50 mg/12.5 mg QD after 4 weeks followed by losartan/HCTZ 50 mg/25
      mg QD after 8 weeks, as necessary. Patients in the nifedipine GITS group (n =
      113) received 30 mg QD, which could titrated to 60 mg QD after 4 weeks followed
      by 90 mg QD after 8 weeks. Medication was titrated upward as necessary to achieve
      a sitting trough diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy, tolerability, and
      quality-of-life scores were assessed after 12 weeks of each therapy. Trough
      sitting diastolic blood pressure reductions after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of therapy
      were clinically comparable: losartan, -8.9, -11.6, and -12.7 mm Hg, respectively,
      and nifedipine GITS, -9.3, -11.0, and -11.1 mm Hg, respectively, with the mean
      reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure at 12 weeks in the losartan group
      1.6 mm Hg lower (95% confidence interval, 3.4 mm Hg lower to 0.3 mm Hg Higher)
      than the mean reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure in the nifedipine
      GITS group. Similarly, reductions in systolic blood pressure between the two
      treatment groups were comparable at all time points. The percentage of patients
      reaching the goal trough sitting diastolic blood pressure was comparable for the 
      two treatment groups, with 74% of patients in the losartan regimen and 68% of
      patients in the nifedipine GITS regimen reaching the goal. Of patients reporting 
      adverse events in the two groups (75 patients receiving losartan and 69 receiving
      nifedipine GITS), there was significantly more edema in the nifedipine GITS group
      (15% vs 4%; P = 0.005). Fourteen (12%) patients in the nifedipine GITS group were
      withdrawn due to an adverse event (eight of these were for edema). Six patients
      (5%) in the losartan group were withdrawn due to an adverse event (none of these 
      patients had edema). There were significant differences in the patient-reported
      quality-of-life symptom bother inventory with respect to edema, with nifedipine
      GITS therapy causing significantly more bother due to edema in patients,
      regardless of whether that symptom was present at baseline (27% vs 9%; P =
      0.0004). No statistically significant differences for bother due to the other
      symptoms in the inventory were noted. Of note, while the incidence of
      patient-reported symptom bother due to edema in the nifedipine GITS group was
      27%, the incidence of physician-reported drug-related edema was 12%. This
      difference points to the need for improved physician-patient communication
      regarding adverse effects and their impact of patients' quality of life. In
      conclusion, a regimen of losartan, when compared with a regimen of nifedipine
      GITS, provides comparable efficacy, and with respect to edema, superior
      tolerability, less bother to patients, and fewer therapy dropouts.

      Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). ALLHAT Research Group.
PG  - 342-60
AB  - Are newer types of antihypertensive agents, which are currently more costly to
      purchase on average, as good or better than diuretics in reducing coronary heart 
      disease incidence and progression? Will lowering LDL cholesterol in moderately
      hypercholesterolemic older individuals reduce the incidence of cardiovascular
      disease and total mortality? These important medical practice and public health
      questions are to be addressed by the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering
      Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind
      trial in 40,000 high-risk hypertensive patients. ALLHAT is designed to determine 
      whether the combined incidence of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and nonfatal
      myocardial infarction differs between persons randomized to diuretic
      (chlorthalidone) treatment and each of three alternative treatments--a calcium
      antagonist (amlodipine), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril),
      and an alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin). ALLHAT also contains a randomized,
      open-label, lipid-lowering trial designed to determine whether lowering LDL
      cholesterol in 20,000 moderately hypercholesterolemic patients (a subset of the
      40,000) with a 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor, 
      pravastatin, will reduce all-cause mortality compared to a control group
      receiving "usual care." ALLHAT's main eligibility criteria are: 1) age 55 or
      older; 2) systolic or diastolic hypertension; and 3) one or more additional risk 
      factors for heart attack (eg, evidence of atherosclerotic disease or type II
      diabetes). For the lipid-lowering trial, participants must have an LDL
      cholesterol of 120 to 189 mg/dL (100 to 129 mg/dL for those with known CHD) and a
      triglyceride level below 350 mg/dL. The mean duration of treatment and follow-up 
      is planned to be 6 years. Further features of the rationale, design, objectives, 
      treatment program, and study organization of ALLHAT are described in this
      article.

TI  - Clinical outcome of a mandatory formulary switch for dihydropyridine calcium
      channel blocker therapy at a Veteran's Administration Medical Center.
PG  - 312-6
AB  - Recently, changes in antihypertensive therapies with similar properties have been
      made based primarily on cost savings for hospital formularies. To assess blood
      pressure (BP) control and adverse side effects associated with a switch of
      patients on nifedipine GITS to felodipine at our Veteran's Administration Medical
      Center (VAMC), we prospectively studied physician records and patient-reported
      side effects (both from the medical record and patient questionnaires) in 127
      hypertensive patients (70 +/- 10 years, 95% men, 88% nonblack, 44% with coronary 
      disease) who underwent the forced switch in therapy. During the period of patient
      visits/chart review, physicians were unaware that the study was being conducted. 
      A minimum of 2 months and two visits on each therapy was required for patient
      inclusion. The mean doses of nifedipine GITS and felodipine used were 55 +/- 24
      mg/day and 8 +/- 2.6 mg/day, respectively. The use of supplemental
      antihypertensive agents was similar in both calcium channel blocker groups.
      Systolic BPs and heart rates were similar in patients taking the two drugs, and
      the diastolic BP was modestly lower in patients taking felodipine (78 +/- 10 mm
      Hg for felodipine and 80 +/- 10 mm Hg for nifedipine, P < .05). There were no
      differences in the incidence of side effects (both patient-reported and
      provider-reported) for the two antihypertensive therapies. These data demonstrate
      that in an hypertensive population followed in a VAMC, mandatory switching of
      stable dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker therapy did not result in any
      significant changes in short-term (2 to 3 months) BP control nor were adverse
      side effects different based on both physician- and patient- reported sources of 
      information.

TI  - [Calcium antagonists and lithium in preventive treatment of manic-depressive
      disorder].
PG  - 149-53
AB  - Recent advances in knowledge about calcium's role as an intracellular regulator
      allow to broaden understanding of possible pathophysiologic mechanisms in
      affective disorders. An hypothesis emerge that bipolar illness arise from
      disorders in calcium-regulated functions. Given this hypothesis, some authors
      propose to describe the common profiles of action of the different
      mood-stabilizers: all the neural mechanisms that are hypothesized to explain
      various psychopharmacological treatments of bipolar illness involve functions
      that are critically controlled by calcium. Moreover, in every instance, a known
      action of lithium on calcium-dependent processes could account for lithium's
      prophylactic results. Similarities exist between the action of lithium and
      calcium antagonists like verapamil and nimodipine. From these considerations the 
      hypothesis emerge that calcium antagonists could be an alternative
      pharmacological agent in the maintenance treatment of bipolar illness. Calcium
      antagonists have been found useful in this indication by a number of
      investigators. Given the safety and relative lack of side effects of calcium
      channel blocking agents, their potential efficacy in mood disorders, it is
      concluded that calcium antagonists may be an alternative choice in prophylactic
      treatment for bipolar illness, especially in patients who cannot be treated with 
      lithium or carbamazepine. There is evidence for using verapamil at 240 to 320 mg 
      a day, in 2 to 4 times. Some studies suggest that the association of lithium with
      calcium antagonist resulted more effective than lithium alone or calcium
      antagonist alone in the reduction of episodes of affective disorders. However,
      concomitant administration of a calcium channel antagonist and lithium present
      adverse interactions (lithium toxicity, cardiovascular accidents), probably
      because of synergistic toxic effects. Therefore, authors advise care in
      monitoring patients receiving the combination of these medications.

TI  - Effects of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists on albuminuria in patients with
      diabetes.
PG  - 274-9
AB  - The present study was designated to assess the effects of two different
      dyhydropyridine calcium antagonists (DHPCAs) on proteinuria in patients with
      noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The hypothesis that similar
      levels of blood pressure reduction with two different DHPCAs produce similar
      degrees of proteinuria reduction was tested. In a prospective randomized study,
      14 patients with NIDDM, hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency were
      given either isradipine (n = 7) or nifedipine XL (n = 7) for 6 months. After a
      2-week washout period, patients were crossed over to the other drug and observed 
      for an additional 6 months. Drugs were titrated to lower arterial pressure to <
      140/90 mmHg. Patients also instructed to follow a low-sodium diet at the initial 
      visit. Blood pressure and 24-hour urine values for creatinine clearance,
      albuminuria, proteinuria, and sodium were assessed monthly. At the end of the
      initial and crossover treatment periods, there were no significant reductions in 
      the level of albuminuria from baseline with either drug. Sodium excretion was <
      110 mEq/L with each drug tested. The results of this study support the concept
      that DHPCAs do not reduce proteinuria in patients with type II diabetes. This
      failure to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria occurred despite adequate blood
      pressure reduction and an effort at dietary sodium restriction.

PG  - 307-20
AB  - The aim this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of DHP calcium
      channel antagonist-nifedipine in human AWS in comparison to conventional
      treatment with chlordiazepoxide. Fifty nine hospitalized alcoholics of both sexes
      with diagnosis of AWS according to DSM-III-R criteria were treated for 2 weeks in
      monotherapy with nifedipine (Cordafen-Polfa)-60 mg/d. or with chlordiazepoxide
      (Elenium-Polfa)-150 mg/d. Evaluation of AWS symptoms was performed at baseline
      and after 3, 7, 14 days using Sandowal-Wang scale. Our original scales (37 items)
      were designed for measuring the depth of dependence (WGU) and the velocity of
      dependence syndrome appearance (WWO). The results show that both groups were
      similar regarding WGU and WWO before treatment. Both drugs caused an improvement 
      of AWS symptoms after 3 and 7 days lasting till the end of hospitalization.
      Nifedipine was well tolerated and no side effects were observed or reported. The 
      group and multidimensional analyses were performed using original computer
      program. The patients were divided into 3 subgroups. Comparison of mean values of
      improvement index between both drugs in those subgroups of patients according to 
      WGU criteria, revealed that nifedipine was more effective on the 3-rd and 7-th
      day in 3 groups and 2 groups resp. According to WWO criteria the improvement
      index was significantly higher on the 3-rd and 7-th day in two groups whereas in 
      one group chlordiazepoxide and nifedipine action was equal. The proposed method
      of group and multidimensional analysis enable us to compare the effectiveness of 
      different kinds of AWS treatment. It is an useful aid of choosing the best drug
      treatment for a new patient.

TI  - Possible roles of medullasin in nifedipine-induced human gingival overgrowth.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - In order to clarify a possible pathophysiological role of medullasin, a
      neutrophil elastase-like proteinase, in nifedipine (NF)-induced gingival
      overgrowth, the distributions of medullasin-positive cells immunostained in
      specimens from patients with NF-induced gingival overgrowth and chronic marginal 
      gingivitis were compared in three different biopsy areas. Twenty gingival
      biopsies were obtained from five patients with gingival overgrowth and 20
      biopsies from another five patients with chronic marginal gingivitis. In the
      marginal gingivitis group, the mean percentage of positive cells in the vicinity 
      of pocket epithelium (zone I) was significantly higher than in the areas of
      connective tissue of the mid-portion (zone II) and adjacent to oral epithelium ( 
      zone III) (p < 0.05). In the gingival overgrowth group, on the contrary, the
      positive cells significantly increased in zone II as compared with zones I and
      III (p < 0.05). Further, medullasin-positive cells of zones II and III in the
      overgrowth group had infiltrated more extensively than those in the gingivitis
      group (p < 0.001), indicating the participation of this enzyme in the mechanism
      of NF-induced gingival overgrowth. These observations suggest that medullasin may
      play a part in NF-induced overgrowth both in host defence and in
      immunoregulation, possibly cytotoxically.

TI  - [An assessment of the efficacy of Lomir in treating hypertension in patients in
      the early period after aortocoronary bypass operations].
PG  - 58-60
AB  - The authors assessed the efficacy and safety of intravenous lomir used to treat
      arterial hypertension in 10 coronary patients early after aortocoronary shunting.
      The following parameters were monitored: systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial
      pressure, ECG, pressure in the pulmonary artery, blood gases, and minute volume
      obtained by thermodilution. Intravenous lomir was found to be a highly effective 
      hypotensive agent in patients in the early periods after aortocoronary shunting, 
      well tolerated by the patients, the infusions being easy to monitor and involving
      virtually no side effects. Lomir improved the coronary bloodstream, virtually did
      not influence the heart rate, atrioventricular conduction, and pumping function
      of the heart.

      schizoaffective psychoses].
PG  - 61-6
AB  - Nifedipine was applied for the secondary prophylaxis of affective phasic
      disorders. 21 patients with both affective and schizoaffective psychoses were
      treated with nifedipine for 1-3 years (mostly for 2 years) in a dose of 20-60 mg 
      daily (usually 30-40 mg). The clear prophylactic effect of nifedipine was
      observed in 76.2% of cases. The duration of affective phases reduced by 44.8%
      while their frequency decreased by 40.4% as compared with the control group. The 
      positive therapeutic effect was more pronounced for manic disorders (the
      transition of the disturbances to subclinical, ambulant level). The preventive
      effect of the drug was more clear in affective than in schizoaffective psychoses 
      (91.7% and 55.6%, respectively) as well as it was more expressed in bipolar
      (84.6%) than in monopolar (62.5%) patients. The low frequency (23.8%) of
      side-effects occurred to be the positive characteristics of nifedipine treatment 
      especially in long-term therapy.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of two long-acting formulations of nifedipine in the
      treatment of hypertension. The Switch Study Investigators.
PG  - 913-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive effects and incidence of side effects 
      of two formulations of nifedipine: a prolonged action (PA) tablet bid and a
      gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) tablet once daily. DESIGN: Patients
      with controlled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg) on
      nifedipine-PA 10 mg (n = 74) or 20 mg (n = 99) bid were enrolled into an open
      label study consisting of six weeks of previous nifedipine-PA followed by six
      weeks of nifedipine-GITS therapy. Nifedipine-GITS was increased from 30 mg to 60 
      mg daily if the patient's diastolic blood pressure increased by at least 10 mmHg 
      compared with the value after six weeks of nifedipine-PA. MAIN RESULTS: Blood
      pressure after six weeks of nifedipine-PA 10 mg (142 +/- 1/86 +/- 1 mmHg)
      decreased (P < 0.01) after conversion to nifedipine-GITS 30 mg (137 +/- 1/84 +/- 
      1 mmHg). Blood pressure values for nifedipine-PA 20 mg patients were unchanged
      after conversion to nifedipine-GITS; 74 patients received nifedipine-GITS 30 mg
      and 14 patients required titration up to nifedipine-GITS 60 mg daily. Sixteen
      patients withdrew on nifedipine-PA and five withdrew on nifedipine-GITS, mostly
      for reasons unrelated to drug therapy. Twenty-three patients experienced adverse 
      events on nifedipine-PA versus 20 patients on nifedipine-GITS therapy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients whose hypertension is controlled by nifedipine-PA 10 or 20 
      mg bid can be successfully converted to nifedipine-GITS with most patients
      remaining normotensive on 30 mg daily.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers for heart rate control in atrial fibrillation
      complicated by congestive heart failure.
PG  - 823-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the safety and efficacy of verapamil and diltiazem with
      respect to ventricular response in atrial fibrillation (AF) in the setting of
      left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. DATA SOURCES: Pertinent articles were
      identified through a MEDLINE search of the English language literature from 1984 
      to 1993, followed by a manual search of the bibliographies of pertinent articles.
      STUDY SELECTION: Studies selected were case reports, controlled trials, review
      articles and editorials. DATA EXTRACTION: Effects of verapamil and diltiazem on
      hemodynamics, ventricular response in AF, clinical parameters and mortality were 
      reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: There are limited data about the effects of verapamil
      and diltiazem on ventricular function in patients with congestive heart failure. 
      In vitro diltiazem has fewer negative inotropic effects than verapamil.
      Clinically there are some reports of hemodynamic and clinical deterioration in
      patients with significant LV dysfunction given verapamil although most patients
      improve with verapamil. There are more data concerning diltiazem in the setting
      of AF complicated by congestive heart failure. The drug does not appear to
      exacerbate heart failure, although hypotension can result. In chronic AF
      complicated by heart failure, there is concern that diltiazem may increase
      mortality. Options for therapy are digoxin, beta-blockers and atrioventricular
      node ablation. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium channel blockers may have a role in the acute
      reduction of ventricular response in patients with AF complicated by congestive
      heart failure; however, their safety in chronic heart rate control remains to be 
      proven.

TI  - Changes in wall motion in patients treated for unstable angina. A suggestion of
      the stunned and hibernating myocardium in humans. UNASEM Collaborative Study
      Group. Unstable Angina Study Using Eminase.
PG  - 903-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study using anistreplase was
      performed in 159 patients with unstable angina. All patients had a history of
      unstable angina combined with typical ECG changes and without evidence of a
      previous, recent, or ongoing myocardial infarction. The purpose of the present
      study was to analyze the relationship between the patency of the culprit artery
      and the behavior of the ischemia-related regional left ventricular (LV) wall
      motion. METHODS AND RESULTS: On entry to the study, all patients received
      conventional drug therapy: i.v. nitroglycerin therapy, an oral beta-blocking
      agent, and a calcium antagonist. Baseline angiography was carried out within 3 h 
      after randomization, a mean of 4.2 +/- 3.0 h (range, 1 to 17 h) after the last
      attack of chest pain. Treatment with trial medication was withheld in 33 cases.
      Sixty-five patients with coronary artery disease received anistreplase (30 U/5
      min)/heparin and 61 patients heparin-only therapy. Angiography was repeated 20.6 
      +/- 4.6 h (mean +/- SD; range, 12 to 39 h) after the baseline angiographic study.
      To assess changes in regional myocardial wall motion, the LV wall was divided
      into seven segments. The ischemia-related coronary artery stenosis was calculated
      quantitatively and related to the quantitatively assessed mean regional left
      ventricular ejection fraction (RLVEF) of the ischemia-related segments. In 118 of
      126 patients who received trial medication, we found that anistreplase/heparin
      therapy leads to a significantly (p < 0.01) greater reduction in coronary artery 
      diameter stenosis than heparin-only therapy (n = 63, mean +/- SD, 11 +/- 22, vs n
      = 55, mean +/- SD, 3 +/- 11%). Anistreplase/heparin therapy was related to a
      larger significant improvement of the ischemia-related RLVEF than heparin-only
      therapy, although the latter association was not statistically significant (n =
      63, mean +/- SD, 7 +/- 15, vs n = 55, mean +/- SD, 5 +/- 14%). The effects of
      change of coronary artery stenosis on regional LV wall motion were also
      determined. A paradoxical finding was that a persistently occluded vessel or a
      vessel showing an increase in coronary artery stenosis was associated with a
      greater improvement of the ischemia-related RLVEF than a reopened vessel or a
      vessel with a reduction in coronary artery stenosis (n = 15, mean +/- SD, 7 +/-
      11, vs n = 41, mean +/- SD, 8 +/- 13, vs n = 15, mean +/- SD, 1 +/- 12, vs n =
      47, mean +/- SD, 5 +/- 16%, NS). One day after the last attack of chest pain, the
      regional LV wall motion was still abnormal in about 20% of patients. CONCLUSION: 
      In these patients with unstable angina, the LV wall motion improved both in the
      treated and the control group at follow-up angiography 1 day later. Improved
      coronary arterial anatomy was associated with a lesser improvement of the LV
      contractile function than when worsening of the coronary angiographic appearance 
      occurred. There is no rational explanation of these results. This is a beginning 
      of an effort to elucidate the clinical significance of the stunned and
      hibernating myocardium in humans.

TI  - Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) study: impact of anti-ischemia therapy
      on 12-week rest electrocardiogram and exercise test outcomes. The ACIP
      Investigators.
PG  - 585-93
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This report from the Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) study
      examines differences in the magnitude of reduction of myocardial ischemia as
      determined by exercise treadmill testing in patients randomized to three
      different treatment strategies: angina-guided medical therapy, ischemia-guided
      medical therapy and coronary revascularization. BACKGROUND: No prospective
      randomized clinical trials in patients with exercise electrocardiographic (ECG)
      abnormalities and asymptomatic cardiac ischemia on ambulatory ECG monitoring have
      compared the impact of different treatment strategies, including coronary
      revascularization, in terms of reducing myocardial ischemia. METHODS: The ACIP
      exercise protocol was used. Exercise variables measured included final exercise
      stage; presence of exercise-induced angina or ischemia; time to angina; time to
      1-mm ST segment depression; number of exercise ECG leads with abnormalities;
      maximal depth of ST segment depression in any lead; sum of ST segment depression;
      ST/HR index; and rate-pressure product at time to angina, at time to 1-mm ST
      segment depression and at peak exertion. RESULTS: Peak exercise time was
      increased by 0.5, 0.7 and 1.6 min in patients assigned to the angina-guided,
      ischemia-guided and coronary revascularization strategies, respectively, from the
      qualifying visit to the 12-week visit (p < 0.001). At the qualifying visit, the
      sum of exercise-induced ST segment depression was 9.4 +/- 5.0 (mean +/- SD), 9.6 
      +/- 4.7 and 9.9 +/- 5.5 mm (p = NS) in the three treatment strategies,
      respectively. At the 12-week visit, the sum of exercise-induced ST segment
      depression was 7.4 +/- 5.7, 6.8 +/- 5.3 and 5.6 +/- 5.6 mm (p = 0.02) in the
      three treatment strategies, respectively. Each treatment strategy resulted in a
      significant reduction in all exercise-induced variables of myocardial ischemia
      measured at 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary revascularization significantly
      reduced the extent and frequency of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia compared
      with either medical strategy. The prognostic impact of these observations should 
      be evaluated in a large-scale multicenter clinical trial.

TI  - The risk of myocardial infarction associated with antihypertensive drug
      therapies.
PG  - 620-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between first myocardial infarction and the 
      use of antihypertensive agents. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a
      population-based case-control study among enrollees of the Group Health
      Cooperative of Puget Sound (GHC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases were hypertensive
      patients who sustained a first fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction from 1986 
      through 1993 among women and from 1989 through 1993 among men. Controls were a
      stratified random sample of hypertensive GHC enrollees, frequency matched to the 
      cases on age, sex, and calendar year. All 623 cases and 2032 controls had
      pharmacologically treated hypertension. Data collection included a review of the 
      ambulatory medical record a brief telephone interview of consenting survivors.
      Antihypertensive therapy was assessed using the GHC's computerized pharmacy
      database. RESULTS: The first analysis included only the 335 cases and 1395
      controls initially free of cardiovascular disease. Compared with users of
      diuretics alone, the adjusted risk ratio of myocardial infarction was increased
      by about 60% among users of calcium channel blockers with or without diuretic
      (risk ratio = 1.62%; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.11 to 2.34; P = .01). The
      second analysis was restricted to 384 cases and 1108 controls who were taking
      either a calcium channel blocker or a beta-blocker. Among these subjects, the use
      of calcium channel blockers compared with beta-blockers was associated with about
      a 60% increase in the adjusted risk of myocardial infarction (risk ratio = 1.57; 
      95% Cl, 1.21 to 2.04; P < .001). While high doses of beta-blockers were
      associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction (trend P = .04), high
      doses of calcium channel blockers were associated with an increased risk (trend P
      < .01). CONCLUSIONS: In this study of hypertensive patients, the use of
      short-acting calcium channel blockers, especially in high doses, was associated
      with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Ongoing large-scale clinical
      trials will assess the effect of various antihypertensive therapies, including
      calcium channel blockers, on several important cardiovascular end points. Until
      these results are available, the findings of this study support the current
      guidelines from the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and
      Treatment of High Blood Pressure that recommend diuretics and beta-blockers as
      first-line agents unless contraindicated, unacceptable, or not tolerated.

      morphometric study with image analysis.
PG  - 591-7
AB  - In this study, we developed a quantitative method with digital image analysis to 
      evaluate the degree of gingival overgrowth (GO), and compared GO in kidney
      transplant patients treated with cyclosporin A (CsA) (n = 21) or CsA+nifedipine
      (n = 8) and a group of healthy controls (n = 30). The method was reproducible and
      reliable. Our findings showed significant differences in papillary and gingival
      surface between controls and transplant patients treated with GO inducers.
      Gingival overgrowth index also differed significantly between controls and each
      patient group (p < 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis test). The administration of the calcium 
      channel blocker nifedipine potentiated the adverse effect of CsA: comparison of
      the morphometric findings revealed significant differences between patients
      treated with CsA alone and CsA+nifedipine in papillary area, dental area, and GO 
      index (p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test). We conclude that the method of image
      analysis we developed is useful in assessing the degree of GO.

TI  - Phase I/II trial of dexverapamil plus vinblastine for patients with advanced
      renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 1958-65
AB  - PURPOSE: The reduced cardiac toxicity of the dextro-(d-) stereoisomer of
      verapamil (dexverapamil; Knoll Pharmaceuticals, Whippany, NJ) warrants its study 
      as a potential multidrug-resistance (MDR) reversal agent. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Twenty-three patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were treated with 
      vinblastine at a dose of 0.11 mg/kg intravenous (IV) bolus injection on days 1
      and 2 every 21 days. Dexverapamil was added to subsequent cycles after resistance
      had been demonstrated. Dexverapamil treatment was begun 18 hours before day 1 of 
      vinblastine administration and was given orally every 6 hours for 12 doses.
      Patients in group A were treated with a dose of 120 mg/m2, and those in group B
      were treated with 180 mg/m2 plus dexamethasone; plasma concentrations achieved in
      patients were correlated with in vitro effects. RESULTS: Toxicities included
      hypotension, asymptomatic bradycardia, and mild atrioventricular conduction
      delays, although one patient had dexverapamil discontinued for grade IV
      congestive heart failure. There were no partial or complete responses. The mean
      day-1 serum dexverapamil plus norverapamil plasma concentrations were 2,575 ng/mL
      (range, 697 to 6,015 ng/mL) for group A and 1,654 ng/mL (range, 710 to 4,132
      ng/mL) for group B at the time of vinblastine administration. These
      concentrations were in the range of those that reversed vinblastine resistance in
      vitro. CONCLUSION: The advantage of dexverapamil as an MDR reversal agent is its 
      potential for achieving desired blood levels with substantially less toxicity
      than the racemic mixture of verapamil. Based on tolerability, it is a suitable
      drug for further study in clinical trials of malignancies other than RCC that
      attempt to achieve MDR reversal. The dose of 120 mg/m2 given orally every 6
      hours, with dose escalation based on individual tolerance, represents a feasible 
      schedule to be considered for such studies.

TI  - Variations in magnesium and zinc in hypertensive patients receiving different
      treatments.
PG  - 689-95
AB  - We studied the influence of captopril, atenolol, and verapamil on serum and
      intraerythrocyte concentrations of magnesium and zinc in 30 normotensive control 
      subjects (12 men and 18 women, aged 30 to 65 years, mean +/- SD 45.76 +/- 12.15
      years) and 30 patients with untreated mild or moderate essential hypertension (14
      men and 16 women, aged 30 to 65 years, mean +/- SD 49.50 +/- 13.58 years). Ten
      each of the hypertensive patients were treated with captopril, atenolol, or
      verapamil. Physical examination and biochemical analyses (serum Mg and Zn) were
      done in all participants at baseline, and in patients after 3 and 6 months of
      treatment. The results were compared according to a nested design with
      Neumann-Keuls test. We found no significant differences between controls and
      patients in serum and intraerythrocyte concentrations of Zn at the start of the
      study, although there was a significant decrease in serum Zn in patients after 3 
      (P < .01) and 6 months (P < .001) of treatment, regardless of the drug used. This
      decrease was thought to be attributable to the zincuric effect of captopril or to
      dietary measures, or both. Intraerythrocyte Zn was not significantly affected by 
      antihypertensive treatment. Serum and intraerythrocyte concentrations of Mg were 
      significantly lower (P < .001) in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects, and
      serum Mg in patients treated with verapamil was significantly lower (P < .05)
      than after treatment with captopril or atenolol. Serum Mg concentration was
      related directly with serum concentrations of high density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (r = 0.4043, P < .05). We conclude that supplementation with Mg may
      benefit patients with hypertension.

TI  - Alpha-blockade and calcium antagonism: an effective and well-tolerated
      combination for the treatment of resistant hypertension.
PG  - 701-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test whether the combination of calcium antagonism is additive with
      the other newer antihypertensives, namely alpha-blockers and angiotensin
      converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. DESIGN: Three-way double-blind, Latin-square 
      crossover studies in two groups of 12 patients with essential hypertension. The
      three treatment periods were amlodipine, doxazosin (study A) or enalapril (study 
      B), and the combination of amlodipine with the second drug. METHODS: Each
      treatment was taken for 1 month, preceded by a 2-week single-blind run-in period,
      in which the patients received a low dose of doxazosin (study A) or enalapril
      (study B) to enable recruitment of patients with moderate or severe hypertension.
      Blood pressure, foot volume and plasma noradrenaline concentration were measured 
      at the end of each run-in and treatment period. RESULTS: The combination of
      alpha-blockade and calcium antagonism caused a fall in supine and erect blood
      pressures. These falls were significantly greater than on either drug alone, and 
      greater than the sum of the falls when taking the individual drugs. The
      combination of amlodipine and the ACE inhibitor was also additive. Both
      combinations with amlodipine were tolerated well by all patients. CONCLUSIONS:
      The combination of alpha-blockade and calcium antagonism has not previously been 
      studied and should be useful for resistant hypertensives who have not tolerated
      beta-blockade or ACE inhibitors. The combination of ACE inhibition and calcium
      antagonism has previously been shown to be additive; its use as a positive
      control in the present studies suggests that the use of an active drug for a
      run-in period may be a useful design for permitting the study of patients from
      whom all treatment cannot safely be withdrawn.

TI  - Safety and tolerability of losartan potassium, an angiotensin II receptor
      antagonist, compared with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, felodipine ER, and
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for the treatment of systemic
      hypertension.
PG  - 793-5
AB  - This report presents data on the safety and tolerability of losartan potassium
      (losartan), a selective antagonist of the angiotensin II AT-1 receptor, in
      approximately 2,900 hypertensive patients treated in double-blind clinical
      trials. In these studies, headache (14.1%), upper respiratory infection (6.5%),
      dizziness (14.1%), asthenia/fatigue (3.8%), and cough (3.1%) were the clinical
      adverse experiences most often reported in patients treated with losartan. These 
      adverse experiences were also frequently reported in patients receiving placebo: 
      17.2%, 5.6%, 2.4%, 3.9%, and 2.6%, respectively. Dry cough as an adverse event
      was reported in 8.8% of patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitors, and in 3.1% and 2.6% of patients treated with losartan or placebo,
      respectively. Only dizziness was considered "drug-related" more often in
      losartan-treated (2.4%) than placebo-treated (1.3%) patients. In controlled
      clinical trials, losartan was better tolerated than other antihypertensive agents
      as determined by the incidence of patients reporting any drug-related adverse
      experiences. Rates of discontinuation due to clinical adverse experiences in
      patients who received losartan monotherapy or losartan+hydrochlorothiazide were
      2.3% and 2.8%, respectively, compared with placebo (3.7%). No laboratory adverse 
      experiences were unexpected or of clinical importance. First-dose hypotension
      rarely occurred with losartan or with losartan plus hydrochlorothiazide, and
      withdrawal effects such as rebound hypertension were not observed in clinical
      trials. There were no clinically important differences in the clinical or
      laboratory safety profiles in the demographic subgroups for age, gender, or race.
      In controlled clinical trials, losartan demonstrated an excellent tolerability
      profile.

TI  - Isradipine. An update of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and
      therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.
PG  - 618-49
AB  - Since the earlier review in Drugs substantial additional data have accumulated
      regarding the antihypertensive efficacy of isradipine in various clinical
      situations, as well as data on its clinical effects in atherosclerosis. Recent
      therapeutic trials confirm that the efficacy of isradipine in the treatment of
      patients with mainly mild to moderate hypertension, when administered orally as a
      conventional or modified release preparation, is similar to that of titrated
      dosages of amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, captopril, methyldopa, 
      metoprolol, prazosin and hydrochlorothiazide. A further decrease in blood
      pressure can be expected when isradipine is combined with another
      antihypertensive drug in patients who have not responded adequately to
      monotherapy. Initial studies have shown that intravenous isradipine is effective 
      in controlling hypertension following coronary artery bypass graft surgery and
      that it appears useful in the treatment of intraoperative hypertension and
      hypertensive crisis, and in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, when
      administered orally or intravenously. A large study, the Multicentre Isradipine
      Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), was designed to compare the efficacy of
      isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the rate of progression of carotid
      artery wall thickness, measured by B-mode ultrasound, as a surrogate for early
      atherosclerosis. Results indicated that wall thickness increased significantly
      less with isradipine than hydrochlorothiazide after 6 months of therapy.
      Thereafter the rate of progression remained parallel for the remainder of the
      3-year trial. The confirmation of its antihypertensive efficacy, along with its
      favourable haemodynamic profile and reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy,
      minimal effect on glucose and lipid metabolism, preservation of quality of life
      and good tolerability, makes isradipine a suitable drug for the treatment of most
      patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

TI  - Effectiveness of enalapril versus nifedipine to antagonize blood pressure and the
      renal response to endothelin in humans.
PG  - 620-5
AB  - Endothelin-1 infusion into humans to obtain pathophysiological plasma levels
      causes mild hypertension, strong renal vasoconstriction, and sodium retention. We
      studied whether oral use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril
      (20 mg BID) or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (60 mg OD) could attenuate 
      these effects of endothelin-1 (2.5 ng/kg per minute for 90 minutes) in six
      healthy volunteers. Endothelin infusion alone increased plasma endothelin from
      3.0 +/- 0.3 to 8.8 +/- 1.0 pmol/L (P < .05). Blood pressure rose by approximately
      6 mm Hg (P < .05). Renal function changes were relatively large: Renal blood flow
      decreased from 941 +/- 76 to 729 +/- 118 mL/min (P < .05) and glomerular
      filtration rate from 105 +/- 9 to 92 +/- 10 mL/min (P < .05); renal vascular
      resistance increased from 101 +/- 7 to 152 +/- 20 mm Hg.min/L (P < .05); and
      sodium excretion decreased from 158 +/- 54 to 86 +/- 27 mumol/min (P < .05).
      Enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure from 94 +/- 2 to 87 +/- 3 mm Hg (P <
      .05) and prevented the hypertensive response to endothelin. By contrast, despite 
      renal predilatation, endothelin reduced renal blood flow strongly (from 1063 +/- 
      127 to 763 +/- 100 mL/min, P < .05), although maximal renal vascular resistance
      was numerically lower (124 +/- 11 mm Hg.min/L) than during endothelin alone (P < 
      .05). Glomerular filtration rate fell from 118 +/- 11 to 108 +/- 11 mL/min (P <
      .05). Enalapril did not alter the antinatriuretic effect of endothelin.(ABSTRACT

TI  - [Value of the combination of trimetazidine (Vastarel 20 mg) with diltiazem
      (Tildiem 60 mg) in stable effort angina. A double-blind versus placebo
      multicenter study].
PG  - 203-12
AB  - Trimetazidine is a cytoprotective anti-ischaemic agent whose antianginal efficacy
      has been demonstrated in monotherapy versus placebo and versus reference
      products, and in combination with beta-blockers and nifedipine. As coprescription
      with diltiazem has not been previously studied, the objective of this study was
      to evaluate the benefit of the addition of trimetazidine (60 mg/24 h) to
      diltiazem (180 mg/24 h) in the stable exertional angina insufficiently improved
      by calcium channel blocker alone. This multicentre double-blind
      placebo-controlled study was conducted over a period of 6 months. The inclusion
      criteria were stable angina with electrically positive stress test, which
      remained positive despite a 15-day treatment with diltiazem (180 mg/24 h). It was
      conducted in 67 patients randomized into two groups: diltiazem-placebo (group I: 
      35 patients) and diltiazem-trimetazidine (group II: 32 patients). The follow-up
      consisted of clinical assessment and a stress test on inclusion and at 6 months. 
      The two groups were similar on inclusion for all ergometric parameters, excepted 
      for the time to onset of the ischaemic threshold of 1 mm and the total duration
      of effort, which were significantly longer in the placebo group. Comparison of
      the stress tests performed at the sixth month and on inclusion between groups I
      and II showed that the ischaemic threshold of 1 mm was significantly delayed by 2
      minutes 41 seconds in the trimetazidine group (p < 0.001) versus 42 seconds in
      the placebo group (NS). Similarly, the work performed at this threshold was
      significantly increased by 1446 kpm in the trimetazidine group (p < 0.001) versus
      564 kpm in the placebo group (p = 0.012). The difference between the two groups
      was significant for these two parameters, p = 0.008 and p = 0.018, respectively. 
      At maximum effort, the total duration and the total work also increased
      significantly in the trimetazidine group, by 50 seconds (p = 0.006) and 570 kpm
      (p = 0.004), respectively, versus 16 seconds and 221 kpm in the placebo group
      (NS). The [double product (SBP x HR)/load (in watts)] ratio at the ischaemic
      threshold of 1 mm reached at M0, decreased significantly in the trimetazidine
      group by 69.9 (p < 0.001) versus 20.3 in the placebo group (NS). The difference
      between the two groups was significant (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Signalling drug-induced rash with 36 drugs recently marketed in the United
      Kingdom and studied by Prescription-Event Monitoring.
PG  - 219-25
AB  - This study examines skin rash, as a reported event, in the patients who used one 
      of the 36 drugs recently released to the UK market and studied by
      Prescription-Event Monitoring between 1985 and 1992. The results are also
      compared to the voluntary reports on rash as a possible adverse drug reaction
      sent to the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). Specific types of skin rash
      (e.g. exfoliative dermatitis) are excluded. The rate of rash has been calculated 
      for 2 periods, the first month (T1) and the subsequent 5 months (T2) after the
      first prescription for the drug. Despite the heterogeneity of the patient groups,
      the rate for rash between the 2nd and 6th months was consistent in the 36 drugs
      and probably represented the baseline rate of rash due to a variety of
      nonspecific causes. This rate (T2) was around 1 per 1,000 patients per month
      (ranging from 0.5 to 2 per 1,000 patients per month). On the other hand, in the
      first month after the first prescription for the drug, the rate (T1) varied
      substantially from 0.9 to 6.4 per 1,000 patients per month. Diltiazem had the
      highest first monthly rate. These rates are listed for the 36 drugs. The
      difference of the rates was tested by 2 methods: a standard statistical test
      assuming a Poisson model and a method based on the ratio of the rates for the 2
      periods. When the 2 rates (T1 and T2) were similar to each other, drug induced
      rash was considered to be rare.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Treatment of hypertension with a fixed calcium antagonist-diuretic combination. 
      Observations from treatment of 5,595 patients].
PG  - 90-6
AB  - METHOD: In an observational study lasting 6 months, 5,595 patients with essential
      hypertension were treated with a combination of a calcium antagonist and a
      diuretic, with the aim of testing the efficacy and safety of the drug. Some 63.8%
      oft the patients had already received anti-hypertensive treatment; 67.3% of the
      patients also had accompanying diseases. Treatment was begun with a single daily 
      tablet comprising 160 mg verapamil, 50 mg triamterene and 25 mg
      hydrochlorothiazide (Veratide), and the dose could be reduced to one-half or
      increased to two daily as indicted by the response of the blood pressure.
      RESULTS: At the end of 6 months of treatment, the overall groups showed a
      decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 15.2% (26/15 mmHg).
      Breakdown oft the patients into various age groups revealed no differences in the
      results. Responder rates varied between 62.0 and 71.8%. Among patients with
      isolated systolic hypertension, the response rate was 66.4%. In this form of
      hypertension only the systolic blood pressure was lowered. During the course of
      treatment, 6.8% of the patients developed side effects, which were severe in 0.9%
      of the cases. In only 143 of the 5,595 patients did the treatment have to be
      broken off. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety oft the combination preparation 
      investigated have been confirmed under doctor's office conditions. The decrease
      in diastolic blood pressure was more marked among smokers than among non-smokers.

PG  - 113-23
AB  - The effect of intensified blood pressure (BP) control with a reduction of the
      diastolic BP to < or = 85 mm Hg on renal function and urinary albumin excretion
      (UAE) was studied in 28 men with primary hypertension (aged 62 to 72 years)
      treated for 13 +/- 5 years with beta-blockade, diuretics, or hydralazine. They
      were compared with 25 normotensive (NT) men of similar age. At baseline (BL),
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) (clearance of inulin
      and para-aminohippurate), and the UAE were studied. Thereafter, all
      antihypertensive drugs except beta-blockers were withdrawn and either felodipine 
      (5 to 20 mg; n = 13) or ramipril (2.5 to 10 mg; n = 15) was added in a double
      blind, randomized fashion. Hydrochlorothiazide was added if necessary. The
      investigations were repeated after 6 weeks and 1 year of double-blind treatment. 
      At BL, the BP and the renal vascular resistance (RVR) were significantly higher
      and GFR and RPF were significantly lower in both hypertensive groups than in NT. 
      After 1 year, the BP treatment goal was reached by all patients in the felodipine
      group but only by two-thirds in the ramipril group in spite of addition of
      diuretics to 60% of the latter group. In the felodipine group, the BP, GFR, and
      RVR after 1 year no longer differed significantly from normal. The UAE and the
      fractional albumin clearance increased significantly after 1 year's treatment in 
      the felodipine group but did not change in the ramipril group. The fractional
      albumin clearance, however, did not differ significantly from normal either at BL
      or after 1 year's treatment in any of the hypertensive groups. It is therefore
      possible to reduce BP and improve renal function in primary hypertension to
      levels not significantly different from normal after treatment with felodipine in
      combination with beta-blockade. Although this regimen increased the low UAE
      slightly, the fractional albumin clearance changed less and did not differ
      significantly from normal. The ramipril/beta-blocker combination reduced BP less 
      and did not change the slightly reduced renal function or the UAE.

TI  - [Increased vagal activity after administration of the calcium antagonist
      diltiazem in patients with coronary heart disease].
PG  - 105-11
AB  - The effects of the calcium channel blockers diltiazem on the parasympathetic
      nervous system were studied by using spectral analysis of heart rate variability,
      and were compared with the effects of the beta-receptor blocker metoprolol. The
      area under the curve of the high-frequency range (f = 0.18-0.35 Hz) during
      controlled respiratory rate (f = 0.25 Hz) was used as a quantitative index of
      parasympathetic activity. Twenty-four male patients with proven coronary artery
      disease and normal left ventricular function (LVEF > 60%) were studied 2 weeks
      after chronic treatment with diltiazem (3 x 60 mg daily) or metoprolol (3 x 50 mg
      daily) before and after administration of the drug. Twelve patients received
      diltiazem and 12 patients metoprolol. After administration of diltiazem the
      peripheral systolic blood pressure was reduced, but the parasympathetic activity 
      was significantly higher than compared with the initial measurement. The same
      effect was seen for metoprolol, but a significant lower heart rate was present
      after administration. The relative area under the high-frequency range
      significantly increased at rest, by 110% after diltiazem and 70% after
      metoprolol. Diltiazem and metoprolol enhance the vagal influence at the heart,
      thereby leading to an enhancement of barosensitivity and of the respiratory sinus
      arrhythmia. This action may contribute to the beneficial effects of both drugs in
      patients with coronary artery disease.

TI  - The costs and effects of switching calcium channel blockers: evidence from
      Medicaid claims data.
PG  - 154-73
AB  - This study used Medicaid claims data from Pennsylvania to examine the costs and
      effects of changing calcium channel blocker therapies. Specifically, we compared 
      Procardia XL with Adalat CC. They are the only once-daily-dosed, extended-release
      forms of nifedipine available. These drugs were interesting to compare for
      several reasons. First, because the frequency of treatment regimens has been
      shown to be the most important determinant of long-term compliance with calcium
      channel blocker medications, it was desirable to compare drugs having identical
      dosing regimens. Second, switching from one to the other should be quite feasible
      in most patients. Third, Adalat CC is priced (ie, average wholesale price) less
      than Procardia XL. The results indicate that prescription prices were lower when 
      patients were switched from Procardia XL to Adalat CC, with no apparent effects
      on blood pressure control, the incidence of adverse drug reactions, or
      nonprescription health care costs. The potential savings to Medicaid from
      switching patients from Procardia XL to Adalat CC appears to be large, more than 
      $2.5 million annually for Procardia XL-treated Medicaid patients in the state of 
      Pennsylvania. Our study also demonstrates that large retrospective databases can 
      be used to evaluate economic and clinical outcomes for specific therapy
      alternatives. Such evaluations are increasingly relevant to third-party payers,
      health maintenance organizations, and other parties involved in managed care.

TI  - One year experience of elderly hypertensive patients with isradipine therapy.
PG  - 911-6
AB  - This is the first report of long-term use (one year) of isradipine, a new
      dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, in the treatment of elderly patients
      with essential hypertension. Patients completing a three month, double-blind,
      multicentre study comparing isradipine to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were
      eligible to enroll in this open-label, continuation study. At initial baseline,
      patients were at least 60 years of age and had DBP from 95 mmHg to 120 mmHg.
      Patients were titrated when necessary every two weeks with isradipine, 5 mg to 15
      mg once daily or 2.5 mg to 10 mg twice daily, to maintain sitting DBP < or = 90
      mmHg. HCTZ, 12.5 mg to 50 mg once daily, could be added for better BP control. A 
      total of 136 patients completed the one year, open-label phase. One hundred and
      fourteen patients (84%) received isradipine as monotherapy (mean dose, 9.7
      mg/day); 22 received concomitant HCTZ therapy at one year. Reduction in DBP was
      significant and similar among all age groups and races (mean change of -19 mmHg).
      Reduction in SBP was similar among all age groups. Ninety-four per cent of those 
      receiving isradipine monotherapy achieved BP control during the last four months 
      of treatment. Twenty-six patients (16%) withdrew from the study: 11 (7%) had
      adverse reactions (one with headache, two with pedal oedema, eight with other
      problems); 11 (7%) had nondrug-related problems; and in four (2%), the drugs were
      ineffective. Based on these observations, isradipine is a well-tolerated, safe
      and effective agent for long-term BP control in elderly patients with essential
      hypertension.

TI  - Effect of isradipine in black patients with very severe hypertension. 24-hour
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiographic evaluation.
PG  - 1058-64
AB  - Fifty consecutive black patients with very severe hypertension (sitting diastolic
      blood pressure > or = 120 mm Hg and systolic > or = 210 mm Hg by the conventional
      cuff method) were treated in an open-label study (without a placebo or active
      drug control group) for 3 months with a long-acting preparation of isradipine
      (Dynacirc SRO), during which time serial changes in 24-h ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring (ABPM), left ventricular (LV) mass index, and LV systolic
      function were evaluated. Mean 24-h ABPM was reduced from 184 +/- 13/119 +/- 6 to 
      148 +/- 18/96 +/- 11 mm Hg at 3 months (P < .0001). The reduction in BP was
      sustained for 24 h after dosing. Simultaneous BP measurements using a
      conventional cuff method and Dinamap were significantly different from the ABPM
      pre- and posttherapy, suggesting a marked "white coat" pressor effect. LV mass
      index regressed from 143 +/- 36 to 122 +/- 32 g/m2 at 3 months (P < .02). Heart
      rate and mean body weight were unchanged. Left ventricular performance was not
      adversely affected. Cardiac index and fractional shortening changed
      insignificantly, from 2.6 +/- 0.6 to 2.7 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2, and from 28 +/- 6 to
      31 +/- 7%, respectively. Adverse effects were few and tended to disappear during 
      the treatment period. All of the clinical laboratory parameters tested remained
      unchanged. We conclude that in this group of patients long-acting isradipine 1)
      showed a marked and sustained antihypertensive action demonstrated by 24-h ABPM; 
      and 2) was well tolerated and associated with LV mass regression without adverse 
      effect on systolic cardiac function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Intravenous diltiazem for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation or

PG  - 884-9
AB  - The objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study was to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous diltiazem in the
      treatment of 37 patients with rapid (ventricular rate, mean +/- SD 142 +/- 17
      beats/min) atrial fibrillation or flutter and moderate to severe congestive heart
      failure (ejection fraction, mean +/- SD 36 +/- 14%; New York Heart Association
      class III [23 patients], class IV [14 patients]). During the double-blind portion
      of the study, patients received either intravenous diltiazem, 0.25 mg/kg over 2
      minutes, or placebo followed 15 minutes later by diltiazem or placebo, 0.35 mg/kg
      over 2 minutes, if the first dose was tolerated but ineffective. Placebo
      nonresponders were given open-label intravenous diltiazem in a similar fashion as
      in the double-blind portion of the study. In the double-blind part of the study, 
      21 (18 with 0.25 mg/kg, 3 with an additional 0.35 mg/kg) of the 22 patients (95%)
      responded to diltiazem, and 0 of 15 patients (0%) responded to placebo (p <
      0.001). All 15 patients (13 with 0.25 mg/kg and 2 with an additional 0.35 mg/kg) 
      who received placebo during the double-blind period had a therapeutic response to
      diltiazem during open-label therapy. Overall, 36 of 37 patients (97%) had a
      therapeutic response to intravenous diltiazem. Heart rate response to diltiazem
      after the 2-minute bolus infusions consisted of a > or = 20% decrease in heart
      rate from baseline in 36 patients; in addition, 17 patients also had heart rates 
      decreased to < 100 beats/min, whereas no patient had conversion to sinus

TI  - A multicentre study to compare the therapeutic efficacy of sustained-release
      diltiazem and enalapril in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate
      hypertension.
PG  - 287-92
AB  - A 14-week study was conducted in order to compare the efficacy and tolerability
      of a twice-daily sustained-release diltiazem preparation (120 or 180 mg) and
      once-daily enalapril (10 or 20 mg). Patients not achieving an adequate response
      after 6 weeks on monotherapy were given a combination therapy of twice-daily
      diltiazem 120 mg and once-daily enalapril 10 mg. Of the 147 patients admitted to 
      the study, 70 received diltiazem and 77 received enalapril; 17 patients
      subsequently received combination therapy. Blood pressure reductions in patients 
      completing 12 weeks of therapy were (sitting values): diltiazem 120 mg, 10.2/15.2
      mmHg; diltiazem 180 mg, 19.1/14.7 mmHg; enalapril 10 mg, 25.7/17.5 mmHg;
      enalapril 20 mg, 19.6/14.0 mmHg; and combination therapy, 24.6/15.1 mmHg. No
      significant differences in the incidence level of individual symptoms were seen
      between the two groups: 34 (49%) in the diltiazem, 37 (48%) in the enalapril
      group; and, between weeks 6 and 12, 9 (53%) patients taking combination therapy. 
      Two patients withdrew from the enalapril group and 8 from the diltiazem group. No
      unexpected side-effects were seen during the study and no deaths occurred in any 
      treatment group. Twice-daily sustained-release diltiazem 120 or 180 mg was shown 
      to be an effective antihypertensive agent and equal in efficacy and patient
      acceptability to once-daily enalapril 10 or 20 mg. Combination therapy
      effectively lowered blood pressure in patients in whom monotherapy was
      ineffective.

      urinary albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretions reflect renal
      effects of hypertension, they were related to blood pressure, other
      cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac target organ effects, and response to
      therapy in mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 85-99 mm Hg). Participants
      were from two clinics of the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS), a
      multicenter randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Participants received
      nutritional-hygienic therapy and one of five active drugs or placebo. Urinary
      albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretions were assessed
      prospectively using office "spot" collections from one clinic (n = 213) and
      retrospectively using overnight collections from the other clinic (n = 210).
      Relationships were determined between protein excretions and blood pressure, age,
      gender, race, blood glucose, cholesterol concentrations, and indices of body mass
      and left ventricular mass and function at baseline. Treatment effects were
      assessed after 3 to 12 months. Spot and overnight albumin excretions related
      positively to baseline systolic blood pressure by univariate analyses. Spot
      albumin excretion related positively to systolic blood pressure, age, creatinine 
      clearance, and left ventricular function while overnight albumin excretion
      related positively to left ventricular mass and female gender by multiple
      regression analyses. Spot, but not overnight, albumin excretion declined
      significantly with active drug therapy. N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretion
      did not relate to blood pressure or decline with therapy. The combined results
      suggest albumin excretion correlates with blood pressure, decreases with
      antihypertensive drug therapy, and is associated with greater left ventricular
      function and mass, as well as glomerular filtration rate, even at mild levels of 
      hypertension.

TI  - Incidence of adverse drug reactions in adult medical inpatients.
PG  - 209-16
AB  - This study was a prospective observational study of ADR occurrence and evaluation
      in adult internal medicine inpatients conducted over a 120-day period. Clinical
      pharmacists screened for ADRs at a county hospital in Indianapolis, IN. Patient
      information was reviewed on admission, every four days during hospitalization,
      and at discharge. ADRs occurring after hospital admission were assessed for
      causality, severity, pharmacological type (i.e., augmented pharmacology versus
      idiosyncratic reaction) and affected organ system. Nurse and pharmacist reports, 
      incident reports, physician consults, patient transfers to critical care units,
      and serum drug concentration reports were additional means of ADR identification.
      Overall, 23.1% of patients experienced an ADR while 2.6% of the 11,702 drug
      exposures resulted in an ADR. Patients aged greater than 65 years (29.6% vs.
      20.5% for younger patients) and females (26.2% vs. 20% for males) were at higher 
      risk for ADR development (p < 0.05). Length of hospital stay was longer (13.3
      days vs. 6.7 days; p < 0.05) and drug exposures more frequent for patients
      experiencing ADRs (p < 0.001). Furosemide elicited the most ADRs with 36 in 244
      patient exposures (14.7%). Diltiazem, enalapril, heparin,
      trimterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination and captopril were also frequently
      implicated. ADRs were classified as mild (35.9%), moderate (52.6%), and severe
      (10.2%). Organ systems most commonly affected were the metabolic/hematologic
      (32.9%), gastrointestinal (17.8%), genitourinary (11.8%), and cardiovascular
      (10.5%). Over 30% of events were idiosyncratic reactions. ADR incidence was
      consistent with previous literature. Many frequently implicated medications were 
      newer agents and the severity of events was less than previously reported.

TI  - Nicardipine versus metoprolol in the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy: 
      a randomized comparative trial.
PG  - 354-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of treatment with nicardipine and metoprolol in
      patients with hypertension during pregnancy. METHODS: One hundred pregnant
      patients with mild or moderate hypertension followed at the Centre Hospitalier
      Intercommunal de Creteil (France) were randomly allocated to treatment with
      either nicardipine or metoprolol. Changes in maternal blood pressure (BP),
      laboratory indices, umbilical Doppler velocimetry, and neonatal outcome were
      compared by means of Student t test, chi 2 test, and analysis of variance.
      RESULTS: Nicardipine decreased maternal systolic and diastolic BP more than
      metoprolol (P < .001). Umbilical artery resistance was lower in
      nicardipine-treated patients (P < .001). Plasma uric acid and creatinine
      concentrations were increased less markedly in the nicardipine group (P < .05 and
      P < .01, respectively). The incidence of cesarean delivery for fetal distress was
      lower in the nicardipine group (P < .01). There was a trend toward higher birth
      weights in the nicardipine group but no significant difference in neonatal
      outcome. CONCLUSION: Nicardipine is more effective than metoprolol in decreasing 
      maternal BP; neonatal outcome is not significantly different.

TI  - Effect of two different therapeutic approaches on total and cardiovascular
      mortality in a Cardiovascular Study in the Elderly (CASTEL).
PG  - 589-600
AB  - Although limited numbers of elderly subjects have occasionally been included in
      population-based studies, only a few studies have been conducted specifically on 
      elderly hypertensives, and practically none at a population level. We studied 655
      hypertensive subjects from a cohort of 2,254 elderly subjects. The intervention
      consisted of the creation of a Hypertension Outpatients' Clinic under our
      auspices but with complete co-operation from general practitioners, randomizing
      the identified hypertensive patients into pre-established therapeutic drug
      regimens, and early follow-up recording of mortality for 7 years. The drugs used 
      were clonidine (n = 61), nifedipine (n = 146) and the fixed combination of
      atenolol+chlorthalidone (n = 144); 304 subjects underwent "free therapy" by their
      personal physicians without any special intervention. There were 1,404
      normotensive subjects. Overall 7-year follow-up mortality was 34.9% in the
      hypertensive subjects receiving "free therapy", 22.5% in those receiving "special
      care", and 24.2% in the normotensives. Cardiovascular mortality was respectively 
      23.7%, 12.2%, and 12.0%. Overall and cardiovascular annual cumulative mortality
      were significantly lower in the << special therapy >> than in the << free therapy
      >> group. The fixed combination of atenolol and chlorthalidone reduced mortality 
      below that of the normotensives, independent of other cardiovascular risk
      factors.

TI  - [Does long-term blood pressure reduction in patients with essential hypertension 
      improve concomitant metabolic disorders?].
PG  - 403-9
AB  - AIM: Aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of metabolic
      abnormalities in patients with newly diagnosed essential hypertension and to
      assess the effects of a blood pressure lowering drug therapy on the respective
      variables. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: Twenty-six hypertensive subjects (12 female, 14 
      male) were included in the study. Twenty-one normotensive subjects (9 female, 12 
      male) served as a control group. During an oral glucose tolerance test the
      hypertensive subjects had higher blood glucose and serum insulin levels than the 
      controls. The hypertensive patients also showed higher triglyceride
      concentrations and a more abdominal pattern of body fat distribution. In
      addition, the women with essential hypertension exhibited a higher free androgen 
      index (32.2 +/- 14.8 vs 20.1 +/- 15.0%, p < 0.05) than the women of the control
      group. After a 3 to 6 month treatment period with nifedipine or nitrendipine the 
      elevated blood pressure of the hypertensives was significantly reduced. In a
      second glucose tolerance test carried out in 13 patients blood glucose, serum
      insulin and triglyceride concentrations were significantly lower compared to the 
      pretreatment period. The other metabolic and hormonal variables remained
      unchanged. CONCLUSION: This observation raises the question, whether a long-term 
      vasodilatating antihypertensive therapy can improve the metabolic abnormalities
      found in patients with essential hypertension.

TI  - Effects of exercise and therapy on ventricular emptying and filling in mildly
      hypertensive patients.
PG  - 695-702
AB  - Left ventricular (LV) filling was studied in 18 healthy subjects and 19 mildly
      hypertensive patients before and after 50% and 70% of maximal supine exercise
      using radionuclide ventriculography. In addition, in the hypertensive patients,
      the effects of oral verapamil and lisinopril treatment on LV filling before and
      after exercise were studied. At rest, hypertensive patients compared with healthy
      subjects had a lower peak filling rate, ratio of peak filling to peak emptying
      rate, first-half filling fraction, and a longer isovolumic duration. With
      exercise, LV filling measures were not different between healthy subjects and
      hypertensive patients. In the hypertensive patients at rest, compared with before
      treatment, lisinopril prolonged isovolumic duration and verapamil had no effect
      on LV filling; at 50% maximal exercise compared with before treatment, verapamil 
      shortened the time to peak filling rate and isovolumic duration and increased
      first-half filling fraction but, at 70% maximal exercise, verapamil had no
      effect, whereas lisinopril did not alter exercise LV filling at either exercise
      level. Thus, the early abnormal LV filling in mildly hypertensive patients is
      influenced by therapeutic interventions both at rest and with exercise.

AB  - A new preparation of nifedipine for sublingual application in hypertensive
      urgencies was investigated in a prospective study. Patients admitted to the
      Emergency Department with a persistent elevation of systolic blood pressure (SBP)
      greater than 190 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 100
      mmHg received nifedipine 10 mg sublingual with a sprayer. A second dose was
      administrated fifteen minutes later if an adequate response defined as a stable
      reduction of SBP below 180 mmHg and DBP below 100 mmHg had not occurred. Of 30
      patients, 21 (70%) responded to the first nifedipine application, 7 responded to 
      the second dose, and 2 nonresponders had to be treated with urapidil. Overall
      mean SBP was 206 +/- 19 mmHg and mean DBP was 113 +/- 15 mmHg before treatment,
      and a significant antihypertensive effect was noted within fifteen minutes after 
      nifedipine spray (p < 0.05). The maximum antihypertensive effect was for SBP in
      sixty minutes (146 +/- 19 mmHg) and for DBP after one hundred twenty minutes (78 
      +/- 18 mmHg). The average reduction in SBP was 29% and in DBP 31%. In first-dose 
      responders (n = 21) a significant antihypertensive effect was noted within
      fifteen minutes. SBP declined from 205 +/- 21 to a minimum of 142 +/- 15 mmHg
      (22.3%) after sixty minutes and DBP from 113 +/- 13 to a minimum of 77 +/- 11
      mmHg (22.2%) after one hundred twenty minutes. In second-dose responders (n = 7) 
      a significant antihypertensive effect was noted within thirty minutes.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Effects of treatment strategies to suppress ischemia in patients with coronary
      artery disease: 12-week results of the Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP)
      study.
PG  - 11-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) study was initiated to
      determine the feasibility of a large trial in evaluating the effects of treatment
      of ischemia on outcome (mortality and myocardial infarction). The study was
      designed to examine the effects of medical treatment to control angina compared
      with treatment strategies guided by ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG)
      ischemia or coronary anatomy. BACKGROUND: Treatments to suppress ischemia
      (asymptomatic and symptomatic) have not been evaluated in a large prospective,
      randomized trial. Before undertaking such a trial, issues about recruitment and
      treatment strategies must be addressed. METHODS: The 618 enrolled patients had
      coronary artery disease suitable for revascularization, ischemia on stress test
      and asymptomatic ischemia on ambulatory ECG. Patients were assigned randomly to
      one of three treatment strategies: 1) angina-guided medical strategy with
      titration of anti-ischemic medication to relieve angina (angina-guided strategy);
      2) angina-guided plus ambulatory ECG ischemia-guided medical strategy with
      titration of anti-ischemic medication to eliminate both angina and ambulatory ECG
      ischemia (ischemia-guided strategy); and 3) revascularization by angioplasty or
      bypass surgery (revascularization strategy). RESULTS: Ambulatory ECG ischemia was
      no longer present at the week 12 visit in 39% of patients assigned to the
      angina-guided strategy, 41% of patients assigned to the ischemia-guided strategy 
      and 55% of patients assigned to the revascularization strategy. All strategies
      reduced the median number of episodes and total duration of ST segment depression
      during follow-up ambulatory ECG monitoring. Revascularization was the most
      effective strategy. Treadmill test results were concordant with those of
      ambulatory ECG monitoring. For most patients in the two medical strategies,
      angina was controlled with low to moderate doses of anti-ischemic medication, and
      the majority of patients (65%) in the revascularization strategy did not require 
      medication for angina. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrated that cardiac
      ischemia can be suppressed in 40% to 55% of patients with either low or moderate 
      doses of medication or revascularization and that a large trial is feasible.

TI  - The Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) study: design of a randomized
      clinical trial, baseline data and implications for a long-term outcome trial.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of the Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot
      were 1) to compare the 12-week efficacy of three treatment strategies to suppress
      cardiac ischemia, and 2) to assess the feasibility of a prognosis trial in
      patients with asymptomatic cardiac ischemia. BACKGROUND: Cardiac ischemia has
      been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, most cardiac
      ischemia is asymptomatic, and although therapeutic strategies ranging from no
      medication to revascularization are being used to treat ischemia, no prospective 
      study evaluating different treatment strategies has been reported. METHODS:
      Patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and ischemia on
      exercise and ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) in 11 clinical units were
      randomized to receive angina-guided medical therapy, angina-guided plus
      ambulatory ECG ischemia-guided medical therapy or revascularization (coronary
      angioplasty or bypass surgery). Patients were also randomized to receive either
      diltiazem plus isosorbide dinitrate or atenolol plus nifedipine when possible.
      After anti-ischemic medication adjustment to control angina, blinded medication
      was adjusted in the medical therapy groups to eliminate ischemia in the
      ischemia-guided group. The primary outcome was the absence of ischemia at 12
      weeks. Follow-up was scheduled for 1 year. RESULTS: A total of 1,959 patients
      were screened by ambulatory ECG monitoring; 982 (49%) had asymptomatic ischemia, 
      and 618 (65%) were enrolled in the study. Most patients were men, were > 60 years
      old and had two or more ischemic episodes, early positive exercise tests and
      multivessel disease. CONCLUSIONS: Design and baseline data for a pilot study of
      ischemia treatment strategies are described.

TI  - A large, prospective, open-label study of isradipine in patients with essential
      hypertension. The Isradipine Investigators Group.
PG  - 647-52
AB  - Isradipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-entry blocker. Previous controlled and
      blinded trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of isradipine in
      lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The purpose of this study 
      was to reassess this safety and efficacy in a large number of patients in an
      open-label, long-term, multicenter trial. A total of 501 patients with essential 
      hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 114 mm Hg) received 5 to 10 mg/d of 
      isradipine in two divided doses for a period of 32 weeks. The mean dose used was 
      7.4 mg/d with titration at week 4 from 5 mg/d (2.5 mg BID) to 10 mg/d (5 mg BID) 
      if the diastolic pressure was still > 90 mm Hg. After 32 weeks of isradipine
      treatment, systolic blood pressure decreased from 154.9 +/- 16.4 mm Hg to 140.2
      +/- 13.9 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and diastolic pressure from 101.2 +/- 5.2 mm Hg to
      86.6 +/- 7.9 mm Hg (P < 0.001). This monotherapy was successful in reducing
      diastolic blood pressure > 10 mm Hg in 62.5% of the patients. Significant adverse
      effects were noted in 92 (18.4%) of the 501 patients; only 30 (6.0%) withdrew
      from the study because of adverse events. In this large, long-term,
      community-based study, isradipine was effective and well tolerated in most
      patients.

TI  - A comparison of intravenous nicardipine and sodium nitroprusside in the immediate
      treatment of severe hypertension.
PG  - 623-8
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to compare the antihypertensive efficacy 
      and safety of intravenously administered nicardipine with that of intravenous
      nitroprusside (SNP) in patients with severe hypertension. The study was conducted
      in 121 patients with severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [BP] > 120 mm 
      Hg, or systolic BP > 200 mm Hg). Patients were randomized to receive intravenous 
      nicardipine or SNP. Drugs were administered according to a predetermined dosing
      schedule for a 10 to 12 h period. Sixty-one patients were randomized to
      intravenous nicardipine and 60 to SNP. Pretreatment BP values for the nicardipine
      and SNP groups were 217/128 mm Hg and 219/128 mm Hg, respectively. Therapeutic
      response (diastolic BP < 100 mm Hg, or a decrease of > 15 mm Hg; systolic BP <
      180 mm Hg, or a decrease of > 20 mm Hg) was achieved in 98% (60/61) of patients
      treated with nicardipine and 93% (56/60) of patients treated with SNP. The mean
      decreases in systolic and diastolic BP were 61 mm Hg and 40 mm Hg after 4 h of
      nicardipine, and 59 mm Hg and 38 mm Hg after 4 h of SNP. The mean increases in
      heart rate also were similar in both groups (nicardipine, 12 beats/min; SNP 10
      beats/min). The mean numbers of dose adjustments per hour required to maintain
      the BP reductions were lower (P < .01) in the nicardipine-treated patients (0.5
      +/- 0.1 times per hour) than in the SNP-treated patients (1.5 +/- 0.2 times per
      hour).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of an angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor (lisinopril) versus a calcium channel antagonist (diltiazem SR) in the 
      treatment of moderate to severe hypertension.
PG  - 531-7
AB  - One hundred and ten patients (mean age 50.6 years) with moderate to severe
      essential hypertension (DBP between 105 and 116 mmHg) were randomised to eight
      weeks of double-blind treatment with lisinopril (n = 56) or diltiazem SR (n =
      54). Fourteen patients withdrew from therapy; six patients withdrew because of
      adverse events (lisinopril, n = 3; diltiazem SR, n = 1) and lack of BP control
      (lisinopril, n = 1; diltiazem SR, n = 1). Both monotherapies were titrated upward
      (lisinopril 20-40 mg daily, diltiazem SR 120-180 mg twice daily) to achieve an
      office DBP < 90 mmHg. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; 25 mg daily) was added to
      monotherapy after week 4 if patients did not reach the BP goal (i.e.
      non-responders). After four weeks of therapy, 72% of patients (74 of 103) were
      nonresponders. At eight weeks of therapy, 66 patients (lisinopril, n = 32;
      diltiazem SR, n = 34) had received HCTZ. At week 8, 53% of lisinopril and 36% of 
      diltiazem SR patients met the response criteria. Mean office DBP decreased from
      baseline -18.1 +/- 8.6 mmHg for lisinopril patients and -15.9 +/- 10.1 mmHg for
      diltiazem SR patients at week 8. Lisinopril was as effective as diltiazem in
      reducing systolic and diastolic office BP at week 4 (p > 0.1). Likewise, at weeks
      4 and 8, no statistically significant differences were detected between
      treatments (p > 0.05) for systolic and diastolic ambulatory BP averaged over 24
      hours. Both treatments were well tolerated and showed important antihypertensive 
      efficacy in patients with moderate to severe BP elevation.

PG  - 266-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the effects of nilvadipine on nifedipine-induced
      lower-leg edema. STUDY DESIGN: multicenter, randomized, double-blind study.
      PATIENTS: 61 outpatients suffering from essential hypertension with diastolic
      blood pressure adjusted to < or = 95 mmHg by nifedipine, and simultaneous
      lower-leg edema. MEDICATION: First phase: wash-out--placebo b.i.d.; Second phase:
      slow-release nifedipine 20 mg b.i.d.; Third phase: slow-release nifedipine 20 mg 
      b.i.d. or nilvadipine 8 mg (mornings) and placebo (evenings). PARAMETERS: Lower
      leg volume, blood pressure, heart rate, weight, laboratory investigations,
      undesired effects, assessment of effectiveness and tolerability by the physician,
      subjective patient assessment. RESULTS: Patients treated with nilvadipine
      immediately following nifedipine therapy showed a significant decrease in
      lower-leg volume as compared with those continuing to receive nifedipine. In
      about half of the patients receiving nilvadipine, nifedipine-induced lower-leg
      edema disappeared completely. No differences were seen between the two substances
      in terms of effectiveness or tolerability.

TI  - [Anti-ischemia effects of gallopamil and esmolol in an intra-individual
      comparison in patients with coronary heart disease].
PG  - 431-8
AB  - To compare the hemodynamic, antiischemic, metabolic, and neurohumoral effects of 
      intravenous esmolol (beta 1 blocking agent) and gallopamil (verapamil-like
      calcium channel blocker), 14 patients with angiographically proven CAD and
      reproducible ST segment depression were studied at rest and during exercise under
      control conditions and after an intravenous bolus injection of esmolol (0.5
      mg/kg/1 min, followed by an infusion with 0.2 mg/kg/min) or gallopamil (0.025
      mg/kg/3 min). In contrast to gallopamil, esmolol significantly reduced systolic
      blood pressure (175.7 vs. 160 mm Hg) and heart rate (107.4 vs. 96.9 min-1) during
      exercise as well as cardiac output (11.57 vs. 9.38 l/min) and significantly
      enhanced systemic vascular resistance both at rest (1241 vs. 1479 dynes.s.cm-5)
      and during exercise (805 vs. 947 dynes.s.cm-5). On the other hand, exercise
      filling pressures and lactate levels (3.66 vs. 3.05 mmol/l) were significantly
      reduced by gallopamil only. Thus, the significant improvement of exercise
      tolerance by both esmolol and gallopamil is based on different mechanisms of
      action: esmolol improves myocardial ischemia by appreciably reducing myocardial
      oxygen consumption, whereas gallopamil primarily improves oxygen supply and
      ventricular performance. Plasma catecholamines, atrial natriuretic factor, and
      aldosterone levels as well as plasma renin activity were identically influenced
      by esmolol and gallopamil, respectively. A reflex activation of the sympathetic
      system did not occur.

TI  - Nifedipine versus captopril in the management of moderate hypertension in black
      patients.
PG  - 440-7
AB  - The efficacy of nifedipine (20 to 40 mg twice daily) and captopril (25 to 50 mg
      twice daily) was assessed during a 12-week single-blind randomized trial in 41
      moderately hypertensive black patients (mean 24-h diastolic blood pressure [BP] >
      or = 90 mm Hg and < 115 mm Hg). Nifedipine and captopril were administered as
      monotherapy in increasing dosage while a diuretic was added after 8 weeks in
      patients who failed to reach the target BP (24-h mean diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg) on
      monotherapy. After 8 weeks of monotherapy, the mean 24-h ambulatory BP was
      reduced from 156 +/- 12/101 +/- 5 to 128 +/- 11/84 +/- 7 mm Hg (P < .0001) in the
      nifedipine group while it remained essentially unchanged (156 +/- 15/101 +/- 7 to
      158 +/- 17/102 +/- 9) in the captopril group. Left ventricular (LV) mass index
      was also reduced significantly (P < .05) in the nifedipine group, while cardiac
      index and fractional shortening changed marginally. The addition of diuretic in
      the captopril group (16/21 patients) resulted in a significant fall in BP to 123 
      +/- 11/81 +/- 7. Only 2/20 patients in the nifedipine group required the addition
      of diuretic. The overall incidence of side effects was similar with both
      treatments but the addition of diuretic in the captopril group was followed by
      adverse changes in serum sodium (P < .01), urea (P < .05), and creatinine (P <
      .01) levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Double-blind comparison of amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with
      mild to moderate hypertension.
PG  - 251-6
AB  - In the final analysis of this study at Week 26, 26% of the patients randomized to
      receive amlodipine attained blood pressure control with amlodipine alone compared
      with 33% of the patients allocated to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Neither
      amlodipine nor HCTZ produced clinically significant changes in pulse rate or in
      the electrocardiogram. Amlodipine treatment did not appear to produce clinically 
      significant changes in blood lipids; HCTZ, however, produced an increase in total
      plasma cholesterol (delta 22.9 +/- 8.6 mg/dl). The incidence of side effects and 
      the rate of patient withdrawal in the amlodipine and HCTZ groups were comparable.
      As expected, HCTZ therapy caused well-recognized biochemical alterations in
      cholesterol and potassium levels, whereas amlodipine was metabolically neutral.

TI  - Long-acting nicardipine for elderly hypertensive patients: effect on diurnal
      variation of blood pressure.
PG  - 386-93
AB  - The effect of long-acting nicardipine tablets on diurnal variation of blood
      pressure was compared with that of standard nicardipine tablets and long-acting
      nifedipine tablets by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in 35 patients
      with hypertension. Long-acting nicardipine decreased systolic blood pressure in
      each age group, and there was no difference in its anti-hypertensive effect when 
      compared with the other two drugs. All three drugs had no effect on the amplitude
      of daily blood pressure variation, and all three drugs decreased the baseline
      blood pressure in each age group when compared with untreated patients. In
      addition, no change was observed in the decrement of baseline blood pressure
      after switching from the other two drugs to long-acting nicardipine. Long-acting 
      nicardipine had less effect on diurnal blood pressure variation than standard
      nicardipine tablets, which are administered three times daily. In each age group,
      long-acting nicardipine also more effectively inhibited the increase in cardiac
      work resulting from the morning rise phenomenon when compared with standard
      nicardipine tablets. These findings suggest that long-acting nicardipine may be a
      more useful preparation for the treatment of essential hypertension, particularly
      in elderly patients.

PG  - 231-4
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate chronic treatment with Cordafen (nifedipine)
      in the out-patients over 60 years of age with established arterial hypertension. 
      Out of 100 out-patients aged 60-83 years 69 subjects completed one-year study.
      The main reasons of drop-outs were: lack of patient compliance (12%), severe side
      effects (11%), ineffective monotherapy (5%) and other (3%). Less severe adverse
      effects were found in further 20 subjects. After one-year therapy hematological
      and biochemical parameters of the homeostasis did not deteriorate except an
      increase in alkaline phosphatase. Regular drug intake in a dose of 20-80 mg/daily
      (mean = 46.0) produced a significant decrease in the blood pressure level and an 
      improvement of cardiac function indices (CO nad EF). In contrast Cordafen did not
      reduce the differences between extreme blood pressure values recorded
      automatically, and it did not produce a significant regression of left
      ventricular mass and cardiac arrhythmias. Nifedipine in mild or moderate
      hypertension in the elderly patient any be an adequate form of monotherapy in
      about 70% of them. Higher motivation for treatment in this age group and better
      drug tolerance may further improve this efficacy.

TI  - Mono- and combination therapy with felodipine or enalapril in elderly patients
      with systolic hypertension.
PG  - 90-6
AB  - Using a randomised double-blind crossover design with Latin square allocation of 
      treatments in 20 subjects (7 male, 13 female-ages: 61-87 years) with systolic
      hypertension, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of once daily
      felodipine (extended release) 5-20 mg, enalapril 5-20 mg and their combination
      compared with placebo in four treatment phases each of 6 weeks duration. During
      each phase, doses were titrated to achieve a predose clinic supine systolic blood
      pressure of 140 mmHg or to a predetermined maximum dose. In both the felodipine
      and combination phases, predose supine and standing systolic and diastolic
      pressures were significantly reduced compared with the placebo phase (decrease in
      supine pressure: -13/-5 and -18/-7, respectively). Only predose supine diastolic 
      pressure was significantly reduced (-3 mmHg) compared to placebo in the enalapril
      phase. In combination the effects of the two drugs on predose blood pressure were
      additive. There was a 40-60% increase in reported symptoms in the felodipine and 
      combination phases compared with the placebo and enalapril phases. Thus, in
      elderly subjects with systolic hypertension, felodipine effectively reduces blood
      pressure throughout the dose interval but with vasodilator adverse effects. In
      contrast, enalapril is well tolerated but is less effective in reducing blood
      pressure throughout the whole dose interval.

TI  - Felodipine, metoprolol and their combination compared with placebo in isolated
      systolic hypertension in the elderly.
PG  - 82-9
AB  - This study compared with placebo the efficacy and tolerability of optimised doses
      of felodipine 5-20 mg daily, metoprolol 50-200 mg daily and their combination in 
      subjects 60 years or over with isolated systolic hypertension. The study employed
      a randomised double-blind crossover design with allocation of treatment order
      within subjects by Latin squares. For each subject, after a single-blind run-in
      placebo phase, there were four randomised treatment phases each of six weeks
      duration, with a dose titration step at three weeks if necessary. Twenty-eight
      subjects entered the randomised phases of the study and twenty-one completed all 
      four phases--13 male, 8 female (ages: median 71, range 59-85 years). At the end
      of both the felodipine and metoprolol phases systolic and diastolic pressure were
      reduced at 2 hours postdose compared with the placebo phase (p < 0.001), the
      blood pressure reduction with felodipine (-40/-20 mmHg) being greater than that
      with metoprolol (-15/-9 mmHg) (p < 0.01). Immediately predose (12 hours postdose)
      there was a persisting reduction of supine systolic blood pressure (-17 mmHg)
      with felodipine (p < 0.001), but there was no significant effect of metoprolol.
      At both measurement times the two drugs when in combination had an additive
      effect on blood pressure. There was a 20% increase in reported symptoms during
      each of the active treatment phases. Four subjects withdrew during the randomised
      phases because of probable drug-related adverse events and six subjects required 
      dosage reductions during the felodipine or combination phases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

TI  - [Comparative and double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of cilazapril
      compared to nifedipine retard in the treatment of mild and moderate arterial
      hypertension].
PG  - 159-64
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of cilazapril
      compared to nifedipine retard in mild to moderate hypertension. METHODS: forty
      randomized out-patients with mild moderate hypertension, diastolic pressure (DP) 
      between 95 and 115 mmHg, with placebo for 15 days were randomized and allocated
      for treatment, double-blind, once daily with cilazapril 2.5 mg (n = 20) or
      nifedipine retard 20 mg (20 = n) for four weeks. The non-responders (DP > 90mmHg)
      had the dosage increased twice, b.i.d., while responders were maintained up to 10
      weeks. Clinical visits were performed before, at baseline and every two weeks and
      the laboratory test was performed after placebo run-in, 4th and 10th weeks of
      treatment. RESULTS: The blood pressure (BP) were similar between groups at the
      end of the placebo (cilazapril 151 +/- 14/103 +/- 5 - nifedipine 157 +/- 17/108
      +/- 7mmHg, p > 0.05). DP decreased already at second weeks (cilazapril 95 +/- 9 -
      nifedipine 96 +/- 11mmHg, p < 0.05, compared to week 0) in both groups at the end
      of study with no difference inter groups. BP normalization was obtained in 58% of
      the patients with cilazapril and in 61% in the nifedipine group. Adverse
      biochemical effects were not observed in any group. Six (16%) patients of the
      cilazapril and 15 (39%) of nifedipine related collateral events, although no
      difference were observed between groups. CONCLUSION: Cilazapril 2.5 to 25mg
      normalized BP in 58% of mild and moderate hypertension patients, and this
      efficacy was similar to sustained-release nifedipine 20 to 40mg. Cilazapril had
      no adverse effects on the biochemical parameters with low incidence of collateral
      effects.

TI  - Safety and compatibility of betaxolol hydrochloride combined with diltiazem or
      nifedipine therapy in stable angina pectoris.
PG  - 213-8
AB  - Compared with placebo, adding betaxolol 20 mg every day to nifedipine (up to 60
      mg/day in divided doses) or diltiazem (up to 360 mg/day in divided doses) for a
      3-week treatment period in 135 patients with stable angina pectoris significantly
      (p < 0.05) lengthened the time to onset of moderate angina during exercise
      tolerance tests at all treatment time points. The median increases in the time to
      onset of moderate angina at the final exercise tolerance test (end point)
      compared with baseline were 1.08 and 0.53 minutes for betaxolol and placebo
      groups, respectively (p = 0.002, betaxolol and placebo groups, respectively (p = 
      0.002, betaxolol vs placebo). The time to onset of 1 mm ST-segment depression
      increased significantly (p < 0.05) with betaxolol compared with placebo at all
      but 1 treatment time point (median increase [p = 0.001] 1.77 and 0.37 minutes,
      respectively, at end point). Duration of exercise also was increased
      significantly (p < 0.05) after the third week of treatment and at end point
      (median 0.62 and 0.50 minutes, respectively; p = 0.03). Generally comparable
      results were found within the diltiazem (n = 128) and nifedipine (n = 25)
      subgroups, although the nifedipine group was too small to detect statistically
      significant differences between betaxolol and placebo treatment. Resting systolic
      blood pressure, heart rate and the rate-pressure product, measured both when
      angina occurred and at the end of exercise, also were influenced significantly (p
      < 0.05) by the betaxolol addition. The only serious adverse effect associated
      with betaxolol treatment was syncope, seen in 2 patients.

TI  - [Comparison of nisoldipine and diltiazem in the treatment of effort angina
      pectoris].
PG  - 115-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to evaluate the benefits of a calcium-antagonist medium-term
      treatment, 20 patients with effort stable angina pectoris were treated with
      nisoldipine in comparison to diltiazem. METHODS: Twenty patients with stable
      effort angina completed a double-blind, placebo controlled trial, comparing 10
      twice daily nisoldipine per os and diltiazem 120 three times daily per os for 28 
      days. After wash-out, placebo and drug period, ergometer stress tests were
      performed. Exercise tolerance, angina frequency, nitrate consumption and side
      effects were evaluated. RESULTS: Our results showed that both drugs significantly
      increased exercise tolerance. Exercise duration was 330 +/- 107 sec after
      placebo, 397 +/- 106 sec after nisoldipine (p < 0.05) and 378 +/- 99 sec after
      diltiazem (p < 0.05). Effort angina episodes decreased from 20 after placebo to 8
      after nisoldipine and diltiazem. Both drugs reduced rate-pressure product at
      submaximal exercise in comparison to placebo. There were no differences at peak
      exercise between placebo or drug periods. Both drugs similarly reduced nitrate
      consumption and weekly effort angina attacks. No patients referred serious
      side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: nisoldipine, like diltiazem, is an effective drug in
      the treatment of stable effort angina. Moreover, the therapeutic effects of
      nisoldipine during medium-term treatment are probably related to decrease in
      oxygen consumption.

TI  - Antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of different drug regimens in isolated
      systolic hypertension in the elderly.
PG  - 206-12
AB  - The pharmacological treatment, mainly based on diuretics, of isolated systolic
      hypertension (ISH) has recently been shown to reduce the risk of stroke and
      coronary heart disease in the elderly. The purpose of this study was to compare
      the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of different drug regimens in
      elderly subjects with ISH (systolic blood pressure--SBP-- > or = 160 mmHg and
      diastolic blood pressure--DBP-- < 90 mmHg). A multicentre, randomized, controlled
      open trial was planned in the general practice setting. Four widely used
      treatment schedules were tested: hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus amiloride 2.5 mg 
      (H+Am), nifedipine slow release 20 mg (N), atenolol 50 mg (At) and atenolol 25 mg
      plus chlorthalidone 6.25 mg (At+C). After a baseline evaluation, 308 patients
      (76.3% female, mean age 75.3 +/- 7.1 years) were randomized and followed up for 6
      months. After 3 months the drug dosage was doubled if the systolic blood pressure
      goal (SBP < 160 mmHg and SBP reduction of at least 20 mmHg) had not been reached.
      Ninety-four subjects (30.5%) presented contraindications to beta-blockers. At the
      3rd- and 6th-month visits all treatment groups, except At, showed a significant
      reduction in SBP compared to the control group; DBP showed no significant
      reduction in any group at any time. At the end of the follow-up the percentage of
      hypertensives who had reached the BP goal was 14.6% in the control group, 52.9%
      in H+Am, 54.8% in N, 28.6% in At and 52.2% in At+C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - [The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on proteinuria in chronic
      glomerulonephritis].
PG  - 89-95
AB  - The effect of two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, lisinopril and 
      captopril, on proteinuria and renal haemodynamics was investigated in 11
      hypertensives (9 men, 2 women; mean age 46 +/- 16 years) with proteinuria (> 1.5 
      g/24 h) due to chronic glomerulonephritis and impaired renal function (glomerular
      filtration rate < 75 ml/min). In a randomized and double-blind cross-over trial
      the patients received, each time for six weeks, either lisinopril (5 mg/d,
      sometimes increased to 10 mg/d after 3 weeks) or captopril (twice daily 12.5 mg, 
      sometimes increased to twice 25 mg after 3 weeks). Initially and between the
      individual treatment phases they were on a placebo phase for 4 weeks. The
      following were measured: protein excretion, including fractional clearance of
      albumin and IgG, plasma-renin activity and renal haemodynamics. Protein excretion
      was not significantly reduced by either drug (placebo: 7.1 +/- 4.0 g/d;
      lisinopril: 5.1 +/- 2.8 g/d; captopril: 5.4 +/- 3.0 g/d). Albumin excretion and
      fractional albumin clearance were significantly decreased only by lisinopril (P <
      0.05), not by captopril. Plasma-renin activity was increased more by lisinopril
      than captopril (Placebo: 1.0 +/- 0.9 ng/ml.h; lisinopril: 5.2 +/- 2.8 ng/ml.h [P 
      < 0.05]; captopril: 1.8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml.h [P < 0.05]). The renal haemodynamics was 
      only slightly influenced by either drug, but captopril significantly decreased
      the filtration fraction in the presence of chronic glomerulonephritis and renal
      failure. - Resulting from their influence on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
      system, ACE inhibitors have, in addition to their known action on renal
      haemodynamics, an independent effect on the loading barrier of the basal membrane
      of the kidney.

TI  - Effect of isradipine on cyclosporin A-related hypertension.
PG  - 50-3
AB  - There is evidence that calcium antagonists may have a beneficial effect on
      cyclosporin A (CyA)-induced hypertension after organ transplantation. In a
      double-blind controlled trial, 50 consecutive non-diabetic first
      kidney-transplant recipients were randomized to receive either isradipine, a
      dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, or placebo. There were no significant
      differences in age, weight, gender, warm and cold ischaemic periods, and original
      renal disease between treatment groups. Treatment was started intravenously 2 h
      before the transplantation procedure and was subsequently continued orally for 3 
      months. The immunosuppressive treatment included oral CyA from day 5 after a
      short course of anti-T-lymphocyte immunoglobulins. Hypertension was treated with 
      oral labetolol in combination with guanfacine if necessary. Antihypertensive
      medication was prescribed significantly more often (16 vs 7 patients; p < 0.05)
      in the placebo group. Standing systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in
      the isradipine group. The standing diastolic and both systolic and diastolic
      sitting blood pressures were similar in both groups. After 3 months, patients'
      mean serum creatinine was significantly lower with isradipine than with placebo
      (142.0 +/- 11.9 vs 164.0 +/- 10.8 mumol/l; p < 0.05). With isradipine, a
      significantly higher dose of CyA was needed to achieve adequate plasma levels
      (8.0 +/- 0.5 vs 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/kg/day; p < 0.01). It can be concluded that
      isradipine is an effective antihypertensive agent after kidney transplantation
      and may have an influence on CyA metabolism. Furthermore, isradipine appears to
      ameliorate CyA-induced nephropathy.

TI  - [Effect of nisoldipine and diltiazem on systolic and diastolic function of the
      left ventricle in patients with coronary heart disease].
PG  - 50-9
AB  - Objectives and background: Calcium channel blockers have a negative inotropic
      effect and protract the relaxation of the normal myocardium. These effects may
      vary in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and with the different kinds 
      of calcium antagonists. In the present study we therefore compared the
      hemodynamic effects of intravenously given equihypotensive dosages of diltiazem
      (D) and nisoldipine (N) in patients with CAD. Methods and results: Each group
      contained 10 patients. After administration of a bolus of 300 micrograms/kg (D)
      and 5 micrograms/kg (N) respectively and following continuous infusion of 5.4
      micrograms/kg/min (D) and 0.2 micrograms/kg/min (N) respectively, the mean
      arterial pressure was reduced by 15.5 +/- 6.0 (D) and 16.6 +/- 4.1 (N) mm Hg.
      Atrial pacing was performed in all patients to avoid reflectory heart rate
      effects. The pulmonary artery pressure decreased slightly with both drugs,
      whereas the cardiac index increased only with the use of N from 3.44 l/min x m2
      to 3.93 l/min x m2. A significant change in the maximal rate of rise of left
      ventricular pressure (dP/dt max) as an index for inotropy was not detected for N 
      or for D. The parameters of the diastolic function (the time constant of
      ventricular relaxation (tau) and the maximum rate of left ventricular isovolumic 
      pressure decline (dP/dt min)) also did not indicate unequivocal drug effects.
      Doppler echocardiography of the mitral valve flow was performed simultaneously
      with invasive pressure measurements. The flow propagation derived from the
      color-M-mode correlated significantly with tau and was slightly improved by
      D.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Calcium antagonists for treatment of diabetes-associated hypertension. Metabolic 
      and renal effects of amlodipine.
PG  - 36-45
AB  - In hypertensive diabetics a strict blood pressure control may decrease the
      incidence of cardiovascular and diabetic complications. Long-term experience with
      the use of calcium antagonists is still limited. The metabolic and renal effects 
      of long-term (8 months) therapy with amlodipine, 5 to 10 mg daily, were studied
      in 15 hypertensive patients with uncomplicated diabetes mellitus as compared with
      15 patients with essential hypertension. After a 4 week placebo phase, the
      diabetics and essential hypertensive patients did not differ in mean blood
      pressure (156/93 +/- 16/7 v 150/95 +/- 9/5 mm Hg), body weight, creatinine
      clearance, microalbumin excretion, and C-peptide and lipid levels, while serum
      fructosamine was higher in the diabetics. In both groups, amlodipine caused a
      significant and long-lasting decrease of arterial pressure (8%), but did not
      modify creatinine clearance, microalbumin excretion, and serum lipid levels. In
      diabetics indices of diabetic control and the insulin and glucose response to an 
      oral glucose tolerance test were unchanged, whereas in essential hypertension the
      insulin response to a glucose load was decreased (P = .033). Amlodipine exerts a 
      comparable and long-lasting antihypertensive effect in hypertensive diabetics and
      patients with essential hypertension. Despite the significant decrease in
      arterial pressure, there was no change in urinary microalbumin excretion. Lipid
      metabolism, quality of diabetic control, and the insulin response to a glucose
      load were not affected unfavorably.

TI  - Treatment of hypertensive emergency. Comparison of a new dosage form of the
      calcium antagonist nitrendipine with nifedipine capsules.
PG  - 268-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the efficacy and tolerability of a new oral dosage form of 
      the calcium antagonist nitrendipine compared to nifedipine capsules in patients
      with hypertensive emergency. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized double blind clinical
      study. SETTING: 23 study centres (hospitals) in Germany. PATIENTS: 161 patients
      between 20 and 70 years with acutely elevated blood pressure (systolic 200-250
      mmHg, diastolic between 110-140 mmHg) with and without concomitant clinical
      symptoms. INTERVENTIONS: Double blind treatment with 10 mg nifedipine or 5 mg
      nitrendipine. Nifedipine was administered as capsules, nitrendipine was given
      from a small plastic tube (vial), containing 1 ml alcoholic solution. Every
      patient received in addition to the test medication a placebo corresponding to
      the other product. Patients with insufficient treatment after 45 min were given
      either an additional capsule of 10 mg nifedipine or a further vial containing 5
      mg nitrendipine according to their group and maintaining the double dummy
      procedure. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Blood pressure and heart rate were measured 
      repeatedly during 4 h, before and 90 min after beginning of the treatment a 12
      channel resting ECG was recorded. At 45 min after administration the blood
      pressure had fallen significantly from 216.0/117.4 mmHg to 170.0/93.3 mmHg under 
      nifedipine and from 216.9/117.3 mmHg to 177.4/94.4 mmHg under nitrendipine. 61.6%
      of the nifedipine patients and 58.8% of the nitrendipine patients had already
      reached blood pressure values < 180/100 mmHg after 45 min and in both groups 83% 
      of these patients were still in this limit at the end of the observation period
      after 4 h. Tolerability was very good in both groups. CONCLUSION: The new dosage 
      form of nitrendipine (vial with 1 ml of alcoholic solution) represents an
      alternative in the treatment of hypertensive emergency.

TI  - A comparison of lisinopril and nifedipine in the treatment of mild to moderate
      hypertension. A multicentre study.
PG  - 487-9
AB  - Lisinopril has been compared with slow-release nifedipine in a 16-week
      double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study involving 102 patients with mild
      to moderate hypertension. Sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were
      reduced 6 and 5 mmHg more by lisinopril than by nifedipine over 12 weeks
      monotherapy. After 12 weeks a greater proportion of patients taking lisinopril
      was controlled (sitting diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg) than in those
      taking nifedipine. As a result, 17% of those taking lisinopril and 38% of those
      taking nifedipine required additional therapy with hydrochlorothiazide. The
      addition of hydrochlorothiazide resulted in similar response rates in the
      lisinopril and nifedipine groups (89% and 75% respectively). The rate of
      reporting of adverse events considered to be drug-related and the rate of
      withdrawals were similar for both treatments. Cough was more often reported with 
      lisinopril and headache, sweating, and hot flushes with nifedipine. We conclude
      that once-daily titrated doses of lisinopril produced better control of blood
      pressure than twice-daily titrated doses of nifedipine.

TI  - [Sotalol and quinidine/verapamil (Cordichin) in chronic atrial
      fibrillation--conversion and 12-month follow-up--a randomized comparison].
PG  - 109-16
AB  - Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmias, leading at least in a 
      subset of patients to severe symptoms (palpitations, weakness, syncope), and to
      hemodynamic impairment especially in the clinical setting of left ventricular
      dysfunction. Thus, in many cases restauration of sinus rhythm is indicated
      because of the negative effects of reduced cardiac output. Quinidine has been the
      first line drug for many years and has been proven to be highly effective
      especially when combined with Verapamil. But there is growing concern about using
      quinidine and other class I-anti-arrhythmic agents because of some hints in
      clinical trials for increased longterm mortality on these drugs. This study was
      undertaken to test the efficacy of Sotalol, a beta-blocker with additional strong
      class-III antiarrhythmic action, compared to a fixed combination of Quinidine and
      Verapamil for conversion of chronic atrial fibrillation and maintenance of sinus 
      rhythm after medical or electrical cardioversion. To avoid early proarrhythmic
      effects, potassium values in the range of "high"-normal values (> 4.3 mval/L)
      were tried to be obtained. 82 patients were randomly assigned to receive either
      Sotalol or Quinidine/Verapamil. There was no difference between the groups as far
      as the underlying heart disease, duration of atrial fibrillation (mean 219 days) 
      and other clinical features including echocardiographic parameters were
      concerned. The dose of the drug was weight-related individually adjusted, and the
      drug was continued thereafter. If sinus rhythm could not be established at that
      time, electric cardioversion was performed and the drug was continued in lower
      dosage thereafter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - A comparative assessment of the duration of action of amlodipine and nifedipine
      GITS in normotensive subjects.
PG  - 561-6
AB  - 1 This study in normotensive subjects compared the duration and consistency of
      action of amlodipine (5 mg) and nifedipine GITS (60 mg) by assessment of the
      attenuation of pressor responses to noradrenaline and angiotensin II. 2 Both
      drugs significantly attenuated pressor responses to both vasoconstrictors at 6
      and 24 h post-dose with rightward shifts of up to 2.3-fold in the dose-response
      curves. 3 There was significantly less pharmacokinetic variability with
      amlodipine: for example, intra-subject variability was 33% with amlodipine and
      59% with nifedipine GITS. 4 There were no significant differences in the pressor 
      dose ratios up to 48 h post-dose with amlodipine whereas there was a significant 
      and progressive reduction in the pressor dose ratios with nifedipine. 5 These
      results suggest that both drugs are broadly comparable as once daily treatments
      but amlodipine displayed less intra- and inter-subject variability and provided a
      significantly more sustained effect with a reserve of pharmacological activity up
      to 48 h post-dose.

TI  - [Cardiac protection in heart surgery interventions by preventive drug
      administration before extracorporeal circulation. Studies with troponin T as a
      parameter for perioperative myocardial damage].
PG  - 379-86
AB  - The present study was designed to test if prophylactic intravenous nifedipine or 
      nitroglycerine could reduce myocardial damage after cardiopulmonary bypass. 45
      patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting were divided at
      random into three groups: Group 1: control; group 2: nifedipine (0.25
      microgram/kg/min); group 3: nitroglycerine (1.5 micrograms/kg/min). Infusion
      period reached from the beginning of anaesthesia until crossclamp of the aorta.
      Myocardial damage was estimated by troponin T (TnT), CK-MB and ST-segment
      analysis of the ECG. TnT is a cardiospecific protein from the contractile
      apparatus of striated muscle cells. TnT-levels might provide a very sensitive
      marker of small amounts of cardiac muscle necrosis. It was tested with an
      ELISA/one-step sandwich-assay with streptavidin-technology [9]. Criteria for
      ischemia in the ST-segment analysis were (according to Smith et al. [19]):
      ST-depression > 1 mm from baseline or ST-elevation > 2 mm from baseline at
      J-point + 60 ms. Statistical interpretation was done by one- and two-factorial
      analyses of variance (including multivariate analyses of variance). Correlation
      between two variables was tested by regression analysis. A level of p < 0.05 was 
      taken for indicating statistical significance. Biometrical data, circulation data
      and data from cardiopulmonary bypass were without significant differences among
      all groups (Tables 1 and 2). Starting from normal values (< 0.05 ng/ml) TnT
      significantly rose in all groups immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass and
      remained elevated until the forth day after operation (values between 0.4 and 0.6
      microgram/ml) (Figure 1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The Nordic Diltiazem Study (NORDIL). A prospective intervention trial of calcium 
      antagonist therapy in hypertension.
PG  - 312-21
AB  - NORDIL--the Nordic diltiazem intervention study was started in September 1992.
      This trial is a prospective randomized open blinded-endpoint (PROBE) multicenter,
      parallel-group study conducted in Norway and Sweden. The study is designed to
      evaluate the potential preventive effects of diltiazem compared with conventional
      antihypertensive drug treatment. Primary endpoints are cardiovascular mortality
      defined as fatal acute myocardial infarction, fatal acute cerebrovascular disease
      (stroke), sudden death and other fatal cardiovascular disease as well as
      cardiovascular morbidity defined as myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular
      disease (stroke). Secondary endpoints are total mortality, the development or
      deterioration of ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, atrial
      fibrillation, transient ischaemic attacks, diabetes mellitus and renal
      insufficiency. Male and female patients, aged 50-69, with primary hypertension
      are randomly allocated to therapy starting with either diltiazem (180-360 mg
      daily) or conventional treatment (diuretics or beta-adrenergic blockers). Add-on 
      therapy in the conventional treatment group excludes all types of calcium
      antagonists. The goal of treatment will be a target diastolic blood pressure of <
      or = 90 mmHg or a 10% diastolic blood pressure reduction. The NORDIL study will
      allow the detection of a 20% difference in cardiovascular mortality between the
      two groups with a power of 80% at the 5% significance level (two-sided test). A
      total of 12,000 patients will be recruited from about 480 primary Health Care
      Centers or hospital based Hypertension Units. Patients will be treated for an
      average period of 5 years.

TI  - [Use of isoptin SR-240 in treatment of hypertension].
PG  - 898-901
AB  - The effectiveness of hypotensive action and tolerance of Isoptin SR-240 were
      studied in 20 patients with primary arterial hypertension. The drug was used in
      doses 240-360 mg daily (mean dose 324 mg daily). Blood pressure returned to
      normal values in 12 (60%) out of 20 patients. In the remaining eight cases no
      blood pressure normalization was achieved. Side effects occurred in five
      patients. General worsening of wellbeing and easy tiring were most frequently
      observed. The results of the present work indicate that Isoptin SR-240 is an
      effective hypotensive drug, useful in the treatment of mild and moderate arterial
      hypertension.

TI  - Effects of vasopressin and nicardipine on hemodynamics and liver function in
      patients with cirrhosis: comparison with vasopressin alone.
PG  - 345-52
AB  - The effects of a combination of vasopressin and a calcium channel blocker
      (nicardipine) on portohepatic hemodynamics and liver function were compared with 
      the effects of vasopressin alone in 18 patients with portal hypertension. Nine
      patients received 0.4 units/min of vasopressin and 9 patients received the same
      dose of vasopressin plus 0.3 mg/min of nicardipine for 40 min. Vasopressin plus
      nicardipine induced a significant reduction in both free portal venous pressure
      and the portal venous pressure gradient. These effects were similar to the
      changes with vasopressin alone (-14% vs. -16% in free portal venous pressure;
      -29% vs. -31% in portal venous pressure gradient). Vasopressin decreased both
      hepatic blood flow (-34%, P < 0.01) and intrinsic clearance of indocyanine green 
      (-22%, P < 0.05). In contrast, these two parameters did not significantly change 
      after vasopressin plus nicardipine (-8% and -3%, respectively). These results
      suggest that the addition of nicardipine improves hepatic impairment induced by
      vasopressin but causes no further reduction on portal pressure.

      amlodipine versus enalapril].
PG  - 447-50
AB  - METHODS: A double-blind multicenter study involving 89 patients with
      mild-to-moderate essential hypertension was performed to compare the efficacy and
      tolerability of amlodipine and enalapril. Following a placebo-controlled run-in
      phase, treatment was initiated with a daily dose 5 mg amlodipine or enalapril. In
      the second week of treatment, the daily dose of enalapril was increased to 10 mg.
      After two weeks of treatment, the amlodipine dose was increased from 5 to 10 mg, 
      the enalapril dose from 10 to 20 mg if the diastolic seated blood pressure
      exceeded 90 mmHg. RESULTS: Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased 
      in the amlodipine group from, respectively, 158 +/- 17/101 +/- 6 mmHg to 142 +/- 
      14/87 +/- 11 mmHg, and in the enalapril group from 157 +/- 15/102 +/- 5 mmHg to
      140 +/- 16/88 +/- 12 mmHg. The reduction in blood pressure was statistically
      significant in both groups (p < 0.0001), but the difference in blood pressure
      lowering effect of the two treatments was not statistically significant. The
      target blood pressure (diastolic BP seated < 90 mmHg) was achieved in 24 patients
      (75%) in the amlodipine group, and 23 patients (68%) in the enalapril group.
      Neither group experienced any severe adverse reactions. Side effects were seen in
      3 patients of the amlodipine group and in 6 of the enalapril group.

TI  - [Is placebo necessary in a clinical trial on ambulatory blood pressure?].
PG  - 1263-6
AB  - Placebo has only a slight effect on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP). Some authors
      have suggested that the use of a placebo is not necessary in a study on the drugs
      effect on ABP. We demonstrate that even if placebo effect is small, the use of a 
      placebo group is still necessary. Effects of one daily dose of 50 mg atenolol +
      20 mg slow-released nifedipine (AN) were investigated. Patients with office DBP
      90-110 mmHg received, in a double-blind protocol, either AN (group AN, n = 31) or
      a placebo (group P, n = 26). Ambulatory BP (ABP) and HR were measured (Spacelabs 
      or Diasys systems) for 24 h before and one month after treatment. The 2 groups
      were comparable before treatment. After 1 month under treatment, ABP was
      significantly lower in the AN group, compared to the P group, and this over the
      whole day (p = 0.03 to p < 0.0001). The effect was the most important between
      10-17 h (p < 0.0001). HR was significantly lower in the AN group during daytime
      (6-22 h), but not during the night (22-6 h). Over the whole group, placebo effect
      was not significant. However, ABP did decrease under placebo in subjects with
      high initial pressure. As a result, an analysis without data from the placebo
      group led to an overestimation of the effects of the drug.

TI  - Long-term open evaluation of amlodipine vs hydrochlorothiazide in patients with
      essential hypertension.
PG  - 203-10
AB  - The long-term efficacy and safety of amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg) once daily was
      compared with that of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (25 to 100 mg) daily in 139
      patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. The study was a randomized,
      open-label, parallel comparison of 50 weeks' duration. Patients were randomized
      in a 2:1 ratio (amlodipine n = 92: HCTZ n = 47). Atenolol was added at week 12 if
      monotherapy was inadequate. At week 12, the mean reductions for supine and
      standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure values with amlodipine were found 
      to be -15.2/-12.3 mmHg and -14.0/-11.6 mmHg respectively, as compared to
      -15.5/-11.1 mmHg and -16.1/-10.1 mmHg after treatment with HCTZ. The percentage
      of patients responding to treatment at week 12 was 74% on amlodipine and 70% on
      HCTZ. The addition of atenolol in those patients not adequately controlled on
      monotherapy produced additional mean reductions in supine and standing systolic
      and diastolic pressures in both the amlodipine-atenolol group and in the
      HCTZ-atenolol group. The incidence of adverse effects was 47% with amlodipine and
      26% with HCTZ at 12 weeks. Overall, six patients were discontinued because of
      side effects while receiving amlodipine monotherapy and one from the HCTZ
      monotherapy group; none were discontinued because of side effects on combination 
      therapy. Laboratory test abnormalities were reported by 16% of amlodipine-treated
      patients compared with 63% of patients on HCTZ. The antihypertensive effects of
      amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide appeared to be comparable and were maintained 
      during long-term therapy.
