TI  - Comparison of cetirizine, ebastine and loratadine in the treatment of immediate
      mosquito-bite allergy.
PG  - 534-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: People frequently experience whealing and delayed papules from
      mosquito bites. Whealing is mediated by antisaliva immunoglobulin (Ig)E
      antibodies and histamine. Cetirizine, ebastine and loratadine have earlier shown 
      effects on mosquito-bite reactions but no comparative studies exist. METHODS: A
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was performed with cetirizine 
      10 mg, ebastine 10 mg and loratadine 10 mg in 29 mosquito-bite-sensitive adults
      exposed to Aedes aegypti mosquito-bites. The size of the bite lesion and the
      intensity of pruritus (visual analog scale) were measured at 15 min and 2, 6 and 
      24 h. RESULTS: Cetirizine and ebastine, but not loratadine, decreased
      significantly the size of whealing (P < 0.01) and accompanying pruritus (P <
      0.001) compared to placebo. Cetirizine was most effective on pruritus but caused 
      more often sedation than ebastine or loratadine. The delayed bite symptoms
      remained too faint for any statistical comparison. CONCLUSION: This comparative
      study in mosquito-bite-sensitive adults shows that cetirizine and ebastine
      decrease significantly whealing and accompanying pruritus, and that cetirizine
      seems to be the most effective against pruritus.

TI  - Variant effect of first- and second-generation antihistamines as clues to their
      mechanism of action on the sneeze reflex in the common cold.
PG  - 1483-8
AB  - Treatment with first-generation antihistamines reduces sneezing, rhinorrhea,
      nasal mucus weight, and, in some instances, cough in subjects with experimental
      or natural colds; however, treatment with second-generation antihistamines has
      not been effective for these complaints in trials in subjects with natural colds.
      This article reports the negative results of a clinical trial with loratadine, a 
      second-generation antihistamine, in adults in the rhinovirus challenge model.
      This finding in the highly controlled setting of the challenge model confirms the
      earlier negative studies with second-generation antihistamines in natural colds. 
      First-generation antihistamines block both histaminic and muscarinic receptors as
      well as passing the blood-brain barrier. Second-generation antihistamines mainly 
      block histaminic receptors and do not pass the blood-brain barrier. The
      effectiveness of first-generation antihistamines in blocking sneezing in colds
      may be due primarily to neuropharmacological manipulation of histaminic and
      muscarinic receptors in the medulla.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of loratadine versus fexofenadine in the treatment of
      seasonal allergic rhinitis: a double-blind comparison with crossover treatment of
      nonresponders.
PG  - 760-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsedating antihistamines are well-established treatment for
      seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), but patients do not always respond to the first
      antihistamine prescribed. OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, double-dummy, randomized,
      2-phase, multicenter study was designed primarily to compare the therapeutic
      responses to loratadine and fexofenadine in patients who failed initial therapy
      with the other drug. METHODS: Male and female patients aged 12 to 60 years
      received loratadine 10 mg once daily (n = 331) or fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily 
      (n = 328) for 14 days (phase 1); nonresponders (ie, those who had <25% reduction 
      in the sum of 5 SAR symptoms rated by the investigator on a 4-point scale)
      subsequently received the alternate medication for 14 days (phase 2). The
      investigator's rating of relief (complete, marked, moderate, or slight relief of 
      symptoms or treatment failure) at the end of phase 2 was the primary efficacy
      measure; changes in total symptom severity (TSS) assessed by the investigator
      (4-point scale) and the patient (11-point visual analog scale) were secondary
      measures. RESULTS: Mean decreases in TSS were significantly greater with
      loratadine than with fexofenadine for the 659 patients who completed phase 1
      (-12.7 vs -10.2, respectively; P = 0.019; patient assessment) and for the 389
      patients who responded to initial therapy (-6.6 vs -6.1, respectively; P = 0.037;
      investigator assessment). Of the 389 patients who responded to initial therapy,
      61.0% had received loratadine and 57.0% had received fexofenadine. More
      nonresponders to initial therapy had moderate, marked, or complete relief of
      symptoms after switching to loratadine than after switching to fexofenadine
      (62.4% vs 51.2%, respectively; P = 0.005) and treatment failure in 10.6% vs
      21.7%, respectively (P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Overall, ioratadine provided
      significantly better therapeutic response than fexofenadine in patients who
      failed to respond to initial therapy with the other drug.

TI  - Inhibition of histamine or allergen-induced wheals by a single dose of
      acrivastine, fexofenadine or cetirizine.
PG  - 351-5
AB  - Certirizine, a potent H1-blocking agent, is often recommended as an emergency
      drug in anaphylactic reactions because of its well documented fast onset of
      action. In this randomized, cross-over study we compared the onset of action
      after a single dose of two recently introduced antihistamines, acrivastine and
      fexofenadine, with that of cetirizine. The inhibition of the wheal-and-flare
      reaction produced by skin prick test with histamine in 20 healthy volunteers and 
      with a relevant pollen allergen in 20 atopic patients, respectively, were
      measured before and at regular intervals up to 60 min after the ingestion of
      acrivastine (8 mg and 16 mg), fexofenadine (120 mg) and cetirizine (10 mg and 20 
      mg). Wheal-and-flare reaction were significantly inhibited 20 min after the
      intake of 16 mg acrivastine in atopic patients and 30 min after intake of 8 mg
      acrivastine in healthy volunteers, whereas cetirizine produced a significant
      inhibition of the wheal-and-flare reaction within 40-60 min. No significant
      inhibition could be observed within 60 min after fexofenadine intake. Therefore, 
      in clinical settings when a fast onset of the H1-blocking action is mandatory
      (e.g., after insect stings or for short-term prophylaxis) we recommend
      acrivastine.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of cetirizine and loratadine in children ages 2 to 6
      years with perennial allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 149-55
AB  - Antihistamines are the pharmacologic cornerstone of treatment for allergic
      rhinitis. The comparative effects of the newer, more specific H (1) -antagonists 
      cetirizine and loratadine among younger patients are not well characterized. The 
      efficacy and safety of cetirizine and loratadine were compared in a prospective, 
      randomized, double-blind, longitudinal, parallel-group study of 80 children, 2 to
      6 years of age, with perennial allergic rhinitis caused by house dust mites or
      plant pollens (verified by a radioallergosorbent or skin test). Patients received
      cetirizine or loratadine at 0.2 mg/kg once daily in the morning for 28 days.
      Histamine skin tests and eosinophil counts from nasal smears were performed at
      baseline and at the end of treatment. Individual rhinitis symptoms were assessed 
      by the investigator at baseline and on day 28 and by parents at baseline and
      daily in symptom diaries. Global assessments were made by using a visual analog
      scale at baseline and at the end of treatment. Cetirizine produced significantly 
      greater inhibition of the wheal response compared with loratadine (P <.0001).
      Eosinophil counts were improved to a comparable degree with both agents.
      Cetirizine and loratadine produced comparable improvements in symptoms and
      according to a global evaluation as assessed by the investigator at the end of
      treatment. Both agents produced substantial symptomatic relief according to
      patients' daily diary assessments; however, cetirizine was more effective than
      loratadine in relieving the symptoms of rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal obstruction, 
      and nasal pruritus (P <. 0001). Both treatments were well tolerated; two patients
      receiving cetirizine were dropped from the study because of adverse events.
      Cetirizine and loratadine provided effective, well-tolerated relief of the
      symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis in small children. Cetirizine was more
      effective than loratadine in inhibiting the wheal response to histamine challenge
      and afforded greater reductions in most individual symptoms assessed daily by the
      parent.

TI  - Link between patient preferences and treatment outcomes in seasonal allergic
      rhinitis: an empiric investigation.
PG  - 268-77
AB  - In a multicenter, parallel-group, double-masked, randomized study, two
      questionnaires were administered to a clinical study population to identify which
      specific symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis patients perceived as most
      important to relieve (personal preferences) and to learn whether any relationship
      existed between patient preferences and the severity of their symptoms during
      treatment with antihistamines. The group was composed of 256 males and 313
      females. Their mean age was 32.4 years, and mean duration of seasonal allergic
      rhinitis was 14.5 years, with mean age of onset of 17.7 years. After receiving
      placebo for 1 week, patients were randomly allocated to receive an antihistamine 
      (fexofenadine or loratadine) for 2 weeks. Patient preferences for relief of
      individual allergy symptoms (rhinitis; sneezing; itchy, watery, red eyes; itchy
      nose, palate, or throat) and related conditions (fatigue, physical limitations)
      were scored using 2 different questionnaires before treatment (0-to-10 category
      rating scale for assessing the 4 symptoms of allergic rhinitis) and after
      receiving placebo for 1 week (Feeling Thermometer). Symptom severity was reported
      in patient diaries after 1 and 2 weeks of antihistamine treatment and was
      measured by patient self-assessment. All symptoms were considered by the patients
      to be important to relieve, the most important being itchy, watery, red eyes and 
      rhinorrhea. The severity of allergy symptoms was consistently related to the
      importance of symptoms identified before treatment. Therefore, including patient 
      preferences in medical evaluations might be a useful tool in evaluating the
      success of their treatment.

TI  - Differential effects of new-generation H1-receptor antagonists in pruritic
      dermatoses.
PG  - 180-3
AB  - In search of an improved treatment of pruritic dermatoses, we have studied
      azelastine, a novel H1-receptor antagonist, during a 2-week treatment period,
      using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The potent H1-antagonist
      cetirizine was used for comparison. Symptoms were recorded daily by the patients 
      on a diary card, using a 4-point scale. The same parameters and adverse events
      were evaluated at weekly intervals, and global improvement was evaluated at the
      end of treatment. In all 230 evaluable patients with moderate to severe itching, 
      azelastine caused an overall significant improvement in comparison to placebo (P 
      = 0.02), with significance also for pruritus (P = 0.01 after 1 week and P = 0.02 
      after 2 weeks). Both drugs reduced itching more effectively in urticaria than in 
      atopic eczema. Azelastine was superior to cetirizine in reducing pruritus,
      whereas cetirizine caused a more marked reduction of whealing. Both drugs rarely 
      caused fatigue and dry mouth, but taste perversion occurred only in
      azelastine-treated patients (9.7%) and headaches only with cetirizine (10.4%).
      Therefore, the two H1-blockers exert differential effects on pruritus verses
      whealing and a distinctive adverse events pattern. The data also underline the
      low efficacy of antihistamines in atopic eczema, compared to urticaria.

TI  - A parallel-group comparison of astemizole and loratadine for the treatment of
      perennial allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 175-81
AB  - The efficacy and safety of the two antihistamines, astemizole and loratadine,
      were compared in a double-blind study of 84 patients with perennial allergic
      rhinitis. Patients were randomized to receive orally either astemizole 10 mg once
      daily (n = 40) or loratadine 10 mg once daily (n = 44) for 1 week. No other
      antirhinitis medication was allowed during the study. By day 7 the mean daily
      symptom scores, recorded on diary cards, were lower in patients receiving
      astemizole than in those receiving loratadine for runny nose, itchy nose and
      sneezing, although not for blocked nose, and treatment differences only reached
      statistical significance for runny nose. After 7 days, 53.75% of patients on
      astemizole and 38.6% on loratadine were free of symptoms, and 87% of patients on 
      astemizole described the treatment as good or excellent compared with 62% on
      loratadine. The present results suggest that astemizole may be more effective
      than loratadine in controlling symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Cetirizine versus hydroxyzine and placebo in chronic idiopathic urticaria.
PG  - 1075-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of cetirizine with that of
      hydroxyzine and placebo in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria. DESIGN:
      A 4-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled 
      safety and efficacy study. SETTING: Patients were treated in a variety of allergy
      practice settings. PATIENTS: The study population consisted of 188 patients who
      were at least 12 years of age, with symptomatic chronic idiopathic urticaria that
      had occurred episodically for at least 6 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were
      given either cetirizine 10 mg once daily, hydroxyzine 25 mg tid, or placebo for 4
      weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients and investigators used a 4-point scale to 
      evaluate symptoms of urticaria and adverse effects of treatment. Ratings were
      compared among those taking cetirizine, hydroxyzine, or placebo. RESULTS: After 1
      day of treatment, patients randomized to receive cetirizine 10 mg/d exhibited a
      reduction in the number of episodes of urticaria (and a reduction in pruritus)
      compared with patients who received hydroxyzine 25 mg tid and patients who
      received placebo (p = 0.002). The number of urticarial episodes in patients
      treated with hydroxyzine did not reach significance until day 2 (p = 0.001).
      Compared with patients who received placebo, patients who received cetirizine and
      those who received hydroxyzine showed reductions during weeks 1, 2, and 3 and at 
      end-point analysis in the number and size of lesions and in the severity of
      pruritus (p < 0.04). Patient and physician evaluations at the end of week 4
      revealed an improvement in urticarial symptoms for the hydroxyzine and cetirizine
      groups compared with the placebo group (p < 0.001). Four patients in the
      hydroxyzine group, 1 patient in the cetirizine group, and 1 patient in the
      placebo group discontinued the study because of sedation. No patient withdrew
      because of lack of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Cetirizine 10 mg once daily was
      equivalent to hydroxyzine 25 mg tid in controlling the symptoms of patients with 
      chronic urticaria, as assessed by patient and investigator evaluations.

TI  - Cetirizine and astemizole therapy for chronic idiopathic urticaria: a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative trial.
PG  - 192-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cetirizine and astemizole have been shown to be safe and effective in
      the treatment of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Cetirizine brings
      about clinical benefit more rapidly. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to 
      compare the efficacy of single daily doses of cetirizine and astemizole in
      relieving the symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria, with particular emphasis 
      on the commencement of action. METHODS: Patients with chronic idiopathic
      urticaria were randomly assigned to relieve either 10 mg of cetirizine, 10 mg of 
      astemizole, or placebo for 4 weeks in a multicenter double-blind trial. Patients 
      rated symptom severity each night, and investigators rated symptoms weekly.
      RESULTS: One hundred eighty-seven patients were enrolled in the trial; 180 were
      included in the safety analysis and 177 were included in at least one efficacy
      analysis. Both cetirizine and astemizole were significantly superior to placebo
      in relieving symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria. Both patients' and
      investigators' ratings indicated that cetirizine acted more rapidly. Both active 
      treatments were well tolerated, and the incidence of somnolence did not differ
      statistically between cetirizine (14.5%) and astemizole (10.3%). CONCLUSION: Both
      cetirizine and astemizole provide effective relief of the symptoms of chronic
      idiopathic urticaria with similar side-effect profiles. However, clinical benefit
      occurs significantly more rapidly with cetirizine.

      of Dutch experience, 1989-94.
PG  - 234-42
AB  - The review summarizes the major results of eight double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, volunteer studies undertaken by three independent
      institutions for showing the effects on actual driving performance of "sedating" 
      and "nonsedating" antihistamines (respectively, triprolidine, diphenhydramine,
      clemastine and terfenadine, loratadine, cetirizine, acrivastine, mizolastine, and
      ebastine). A common, standardized test was used that measures driving impairment 
      from vehicular "weaving" (i.e., standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP)).
      Logical relationships were found between impairment and dose, time after dosing, 
      and repeated doses over 4-5 days. The newer drugs were generally less impairing, 
      but differences existed among their effects, and none was unimpairing at doses
      1-2x the currently recommended levels. One or possibly two of the newer drugs
      possessed both performance-enhancing and -impairing properties, depending on
      dose, suggesting two mechanisms of action.

AB  - This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of loratadine and
      astemizole for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 167 adult 
      patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis was enrolled in a randomized
      double-blind, parallel group study. Patients were treated once daily for 2 months
      during a spring allergy season. Both treatment groups showed significant
      reduction of symptoms (P < .01) from baseline. The physicians' and patients'
      evaluations of response to treatment were generally higher for loratadine than
      astemizole but only reached statistical significance (P < .05) at the 1-week
      evaluation. Astemizole-treated patients showed statistically significantly more
      weight gain than did loratadine-treated patients. Loratadine and astemizole were 
      comparable in reducing the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Both
      treatments were well tolerated, although less weight gain was observed in
      patients treated with loratadine.

TI  - A comparison of the efficacy of azelastine nasal spray and loratidine tablets in 
      the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 268-75
AB  - A total of 30 patients suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated in 
      a 6-week randomized, double-blind, double-dummy parallel-group study, comparing
      azelastine nasal spray (0.14 mg/nostril administered twice daily) and loratidine 
      tablets (10 mg once daily). Symptoms evaluated were sneezing, nose and/or eye
      itching, lacrimation, rhinorrhoea, photophobia, nasal occlusion, throat
      irritation, smell loss, nasal mucosa swelling, conjunctivitis, and pharyngeal
      mucosa reddening. Each symptom was assessed according to severity and given a
      score on a four-point rating scale. Compared with baseline, total symptom scores 
      for both the azelastine and loratidine treatment groups were reduced at each of
      the assessments during treatment. No significant differences were observed
      between the two treatment groups. The investigator concluded that azelastine,
      formulated as a nasal spray, is as effective as loratidine tablets in the relief 
      of the symptoms of seasonal rhinitis and that it has a rapid onset of action.

TI  - Changing medication use in managed care: a critical review of the available
      evidence.
PG  - 715-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the effectiveness of strategies to improve the quality and
      efficiency of medication use in managed care organizations (MCOs). STUDY DESIGN: 
      Systematic review of published intervention studies. METHODS: Studies were
      identified by using computerized and manual literature searches and personal
      contacts, and were categorized by intervention type and adequacy of research
      design according to commonly accepted criteria. Reported significance and
      magnitude of the changes in key outcomes were used to summarize the effects of
      studies with adequate research designs. RESULTS: The searches identified 105
      studies, 70 of which were reported since 1996. Overall, 46% of the studies met
      the minimum criteria for methodologic adequacy (n = 48). Consistently effective
      interventions included dissemination of educational materials with drug samples, 
      participatory clinical guideline development, group or one-to-one educational
      outreach, and enhanced patient-specific feedback. Disease management (primarily
      for depression and diabetes) showed promise in improving short-term outcomes.
      Dissemination of educational materials and aggregated feedback alone were
      ineffective. Interventions in staff-model health maintenance organizations were
      more effective than those conducted in group-model health maintenance
      organizations. CONCLUSION: High-quality studies of interventions to improve drug 
      use in MCOs are increasing in frequency. There is evidence for the effectiveness 
      of several strategies to change drug use, but little is known about longer-term
      clinical outcomes. Few well-designed, published studies have assessed the
      efficacy or safety of financial incentives for physicians, tiered copayments for 
      patients, or formularies--despite their widespread use.

TI  - [Acute interstitial nephritis induced by loratadine].
PG  - 355-8
AB  - Loratadine is a second generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist, that has high
      potency antiallergic properties and is associated with low adverse effects
      compared with other antihistamines. Acute interstitial nephritis is a cause of
      acute renal failure that is most often induced by drugs or, less frequently,
      infection or sarcoidosis. Although the number of drugs associated with acute
      intersticial nephritis is too large, the antihistaminic loratadine have never
      been reported before. We report a case of an interstitial nephritis with acute
      renal failure that suggesting hypersensitivity reaction in a 77 old man who had
      received loratadine (10 mg/day) during ten days before his assessment to our
      hospital by disseminated pruritic syndrome. The initial suspect was rapidly
      progressive glomerulonephitis and renal biopsy was practice and treatment with
      corticosteroids were initiated (prednisone bolus of 500 mg three days and 1
      mg/kg/day/later). The loratadine therapy was cessation. He exhibiting a slow and 
      progressive improvement on renal function and one month later, urea and
      creatinine levels was normal and hematuria and proteinuria had disappeared. The
      corticosteroids therapy were progressive decreased until withdrawal. We think
      that this is an interesting case, basing in its clinical presentation and that it
      had never been reported before.

TI  - Pre and post treatment mucociliary function in allergic rhinitis in three
      different treatment modalities.
PG  - 17-20
AB  - Allergic rhinitis causes an impairment of the mucociliary function in the nose.
      It is hoped that treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis would be able to revert
      mucociliary function to normal. This study aims to compare pre and post treatment
      mucociliary transport time in 3 different treatment modalities. Ninety-two newly 
      diagnosed patients with allergic rhinitis were randomised into 3 groups and
      started on different treatment regimes. At the end of 8 weeks, the group treated 
      with only intranasal beclomethasone showed some, though not significant,
      improvement in the mucociliary function. There were no changes in the mucociliary
      function in the other two groups treated with beclomethasone and loratidine or
      loratidine alone.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of desloratadine and levocetirizine on
      histamine-induced wheal, flare and itch in human skin.
PG  - 424-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A previous study showed the inhibitory effects of loratadine on
      histamine-induced wheal, flare and itch in human skin to be very variable between
      individuals. It was hypothesised that this variability may have been due to
      differences in the rates of metabolism of loratadine to its active form,
      desloratadine. This double blind, crossover study examined the effects of
      desloratadine in 12 healthy volunteers. Levocetirizine was used as a comparator. 
      METHODS: Desloratadine (5 mg), levocetirizine (5 mg) or placebo was taken orally 
      4 h before an intradermal injection of histamine (20 microL, 100 microM) or
      vehicle control into the forearm skin. Flare areas were assessed by scanning
      laser Doppler imaging before and at 30 s intervals for a period of 9 min. Wheal
      areas were measured by planimetry at 10 min. Itch was scored every 30 s for 5 min
      using a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Following placebo administration, the
      mean (+/- SEM) wheal area at 10 min was 79.3 +/- 6.9 mm(2), mean flare area for
      the first 5 min following challenge 26.6 +/- 2.7 cm(2), and itch score for the
      same period 48.5 +/- 7.6%. The effects of desloratadine were variable between
      individuals, mean reductions in the wheal and flare areas being 17% (P = 0.033)
      and 12% (P = 0.036). Desloratadine did not reduce itch significantly.
      Levocetirizine was more consistent in its effects, mean reductions in wheal,
      flare and itch being 51%, 67% 78% respectively (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A
      single dose of 5 mg levocetirizine produced more consistent and greater
      inhibitory effects on histamine-induced wheal, flare and itch than did 5 mg
      desloratadine. The difference is suggested to reflect the basic pharmacokinetics 
      of the two drugs.

TI  - Leukotriene C4 synthase polymorphisms and responsiveness to leukotriene
      antagonists in asthma.
PG  - 422-6
AB  - AIM: Cysteinyl leukotrienes are important pro-inflammatory mediators in the
      pathogenesis of asthma, while leukotriene C4 synthase is a key enzyme in their
      biosynthesis. Our aim is to evaluate whether responsiveness to leukotriene
      receptor antagonists was determined by expression of the variant (C) or wild-type
      (A) polymorphism of this enzyme. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective analysis
      of 8 randomised, placebo-controlled trials performed in our department in
      mild-to-moderate asthmatics. In all trials, effect of leukotriene receptor
      antagonist was compared to placebo, where the primary outcome was bronchial
      hyperresponsiveness to adenosine monophosphate or methacholine. Secondary
      outcomes were forced expiratory volume in 1 second, exhaled nitric oxide and
      peripheral blood eosinophils. RESULTS: For the primary outcome of attenuation of 
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness by leukotriene receptor antagonist vs placebo,
      there were significant effects within each genotype on adenosine monophosphate
      (AMP) (n = 78): 2.21 and 2.07-fold improvements for AA and AC/CC, respectively;
      while for methacholine (n = 81) there were 1.39 and 1.36-fold improvements,
      respectively. There were no significant differences between genotypes (i.e. AA vs
      AC/CC): geometric mean fold-differences of 1.07 (95%CI 0.63-1.81) and 1.02 (95%CI
      0.70-1.50) for AMP and methacholine, respectively. There were also no differences
      between genotypes for all secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of
      leukotriene C4 synthase did not determine responsiveness, in terms of attenuation
      of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, to leukotriene receptor antagonists in
      mild-to-moderate asthmatics. Further prospective large pharmacogenetic studies
      are required in more severe patients, where there may be greater improvements in 
      pharmacodynamic outcome measures such as bronchial hyperresponsiveness and
      exhaled nitric oxide.

TI  - Twenty-four-hour activity and consistency of activity of levocetirizine and
      desloratadine in the skin.
PG  - 388-94
AB  - AIM: Levocetirizine, the active enantiomer of cetirizine, and desloratadine, the 
      active metabolite of loratadine, are two recently introduced anti-H1 agents. We
      set out to compare their antihistaminic activity in the skin for 24 h in a
      double-blind, randomized cross-over trial. METHODS: The skin reaction to
      histamine administered by prick tests (100 mg ml(-1)) was measured by the surface
      areas of weals and flares for 24 h [before treatment, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 
      12 and 24 h after a single dose of levocetirizine (5 mg), desloratadine (5 mg) or
      placebo] in 18 healthy volunteers (34.8 +/- 9.4 years; 14 women). The areas under
      the curves (AUC) of the weal and flare areas as a function of time were compared 
      by ANOVA. RESULTS: A highly significant overall treatment effect (P < 0.0001) was
      observed and both weals and flares were inhibited. The pairwise comparisons
      showed that the activity of levocetirizine and desloratadine was significantly
      superior to that of placebo (P < 0.0001), and the activity of levocetirizine was 
      significantly superior to that of desloratadine (P < 0.0001). 'Total' weal
      inhibition (> or = 95%) occurred only with levocetirizine. Median values of
      maximal weal inhibition were 44.2% with placebo, 55.0% with desloratadine and
      100% with levocetirizine. The time to maximal weal inhibition was 4 h (median
      value) for all three study drugs, but scattered over a wider range for
      desloratadine (3-24 h) than levocetirizine (2-4 h). With desloratadine, five of
      18 (28%) subjects reached weal inhibition of at least 70% at between 3 and 10 h, 
      whereas with levocetirizine all subjects [18/18 (100%)] reached this level of
      weal inhibition at between 1 and 3 h. The median duration of 70% weal inhibition 
      was zero with placebo and desloratadine, and was 21.4 h with levocetirizine (P < 
      0.0001 between the three study drugs, and P < 0.0001 between the two active
      drugs). No uncommon adverse events were reported, and no subject withdrew from
      the study due to an adverse event. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the activity
      of levocetirizine in suppressing skin reactivity to histamine was clearly
      superior to that of desloratadine for 24 h after a single dose. In addition, its 
      activity was more consistent and lasted longer.

TI  - Comparison of ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution alone, desloratadine alone, 
      and their combination for inhibition of the signs and symptoms of seasonal
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model: a
      double-masked, placebo- and active-controlled trial.
PG  - 1975-87
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ketotifen fumarate is a topical antiallergic combination mast-cell
      stabilizer and antihistamine indicated for the temporary prevention of ocular
      itching due to allergic conjunctivitis. Desloratadine is a systemic antihistamine
      indicated for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis.
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of ketotifen
      0.025% ophthalmic solution instilled in the eye, desloratadine 5-mg tablets taken
      orally, and their combination for prevention of the signs and symptoms of
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, as induced by the conjunctival allergen challenge
      (CAC) model. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-masked, placebo- and
      active-controlled, single-center clinical trial. At visit l, the dose of allergen
      necessary to elicit a qualifying allergic reaction was determined for subjects
      meeting the entry criteria. At visit 2, the allergen dose determined at visit 1
      was confirmed, and all subjects who had a qualifying ocular and nasal allergic
      reaction were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: ketotifen ophthalmic
      solution and placebo tablet, desloratadine tablet and placebo eyedrop, or
      ketotifen and desloratadine. Subjects were instructed to instill 1 drop into each
      eye twice daily and take 1 tablet with water once daily at the same time as the
      morning eyedrop for approximately 4 weeks. At visit 3, subjects brought in their 
      medication and were given 1 drop of the eyedrop bilaterally and 1 tablet with
      water. Bilateral CAC was performed 2 hours after administration of medication.
      Using standardized scales, subjects rated ocular itching at 3, 5, and 7 minutes
      after CAC; ocular tearing and eyelid swelling at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after
      CAC; and nasal signs and symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea and postnasal drip,
      pruritus, and nasal congestion) at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes after CAC. The 
      investigator graded ocular redness and chemosis at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after
      CAC. At all visits, subjects were offered an anti-allergy eyedrop to relieve any 
      immediate ocular discomfort caused by CAC. RESULTS: One hundred two subjects were
      screened-82 (55 women, 27 men; mean age, 42.8 years [range, 21-70 years]) were
      randomized to treatment, and 80 completed the study. Subjects in the group that
      received ketotifen (n = 27) and the group that received ketotifen with
      desloratadine (n = 26) had significantly lower mean itching scores compared with 
      those in the group that received desloratadine alone (n = 27) at all time points 
      (P </= 0.05). Total ocular redness, calculated by summing the mean redness scores
      for each of the 3 vessel beds, was significantly lower in the ketotifen group
      than in the other treatment groups at most time points (P </= 0.05). All
      treatments attenuated nasal symptoms; no statistically significant differences
      were noted between treatment groups, with the exception of the 50-minute time
      point, at which combination treatment was significantly more effective than
      ketotifen alone (P </= 0.05). The proportion of subjects who requested relief
      drops after CAC was significantly lower in both the ketotifen alone and
      combination treatment groups compared with the desloratadine alone group (P =
      0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Ketotifen ophthalmic solution significantly decreased the
      signs and symptoms of ocular and nasal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The addition
      of ketotifen to the oral desloratadine regimen improved the overall antiallergic 
      efficacy of both medications.

TI  - Assessing satisfaction with desloratadine and fexofenadine in allergy patients
      who report dissatisfaction with loratadine.
PG  - 10
AB  - BACKGROUND: The FDA recently moved loratadine (Claritin) from prescription only
      status to over-the-counter (OTC). In response to the availability of an OTC
      non-sedating antihistamine, many managed care organizations are reevaluating
      which if any prescription antihistamines should remain on formulary. From a
      managed care perspective, determining which of the remaining prescription
      antihistamines results in the greatest patient satisfaction with allergy
      treatment would be informative. METHODS: We report on a weighted cross sectional 
      survey (n = 10,023) delivered online to a sample of allergy sufferers in the U.S.
      during the month of December 2002. Two segments were identified for analysis:
      patient who were dissatisfied with loratadine and converted to desloratadine
      (Clarinex; n = 61), and patients who were dissatisfied with loratadine and
      converted to fexofenadine (Allegra; n = 211). The two segments were compared
      along a series of measures that the literature suggests are related to treatment 
      satisfaction. RESULTS: The survey found that two of the satisfaction measures
      differentiated desloratadine converters from fexofenadine converters (p <.05):
      mean sum of self-reported adverse events and nighttime awakening due to allergy
      symptoms. For the remainder of satisfaction measures though, patients who were
      dissatisfied with loratadine reported equal duration of coverage and satisfaction
      with desloratadine as fexofenadine. When severity of disease was controlled for
      in the analysis, a pattern emerged suggesting greater levels of satisfaction
      amongst loratadine dissatisfied patients who converted to desloratadine. Point
      estimates suggest a consistent pattern favoring desloratadine patient
      satisfaction, with statistically significant results reported for sum of adverse 
      effects, nighttime awakening due to symptoms, symptom severity just prior to the 
      next dose, and overall satisfaction (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: On average, patients
      who were dissatisfied with loratadine reported equal or better satisfaction with 
      desloratadine as fexofenadine. Patients with severe allergic rhinitis reported
      greater satisfaction when converted from loratadine to desloratadine than
      fexofenadine for select satisfaction measures. These results suggest that if
      managed care intends to position prescription antihistamines as second line for
      OTC loratadine treatment dissatisfaction, desloratadine is a useful treatment
      alternative. These findings, while informative to formulary decision-makers, must
      be interpreted with caution. Only through head-to-head controlled clinical trials
      can differences in efficacy and safety be established.

TI  - Levocetirizine is effective for symptom relief including nasal congestion in
      adolescent and adult (PAR) sensitized to house dust mites.
PG  - 893-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antihistamines are the most commonly prescribed class of medication
      for perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR). The primary objective of this study was to
      determine whether levocetirizine (Xyzal(R)), the active enantiomer of cetirizine,
      could achieve at least a 50% improvement in PAR symptoms compared to the placebo 
      over the first week of treatment. METHODS: A total of 294 patients with PAR due
      to house dust mites were randomized in this 8-week double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicentre trial to receive either levocetirizine 5 mg/day
      or placebo. Mean Total Four-Symptom Scores (T4SS) (nasal pruritus, ocular
      pruritus, rhinorrhoea and sneezing) were compared between treatment groups over
      weeks 1, 4 and 6. All individual symptom scores, including nasal congestion, were
      also studied. RESULTS: Levocetirizine showed an 86% improvement in T4SS over the 
      first week of treatment and a 47% improvement over the entire treatment period
      compared with placebo. Absolute changes from baseline were 3.64 and 2.47 for
      levocetirizine and placebo, respectively. Individual symptom scores showed
      statistically significant (P < or = 0.01) differences in favour of levocetirizine
      for all study time-points. Nasal congestion was unexpectedly significantly
      improved (P < 0.001). The incidence of reported adverse events was comparable
      between treatment and placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Levocetirizine 5 mg/day is an
      effective and well-tolerated treatment of PAR. In addition, levocetirizine is
      effective for the relief of nasal congestion.

TI  - A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
      investigation of the effects of fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg alone and with 
      alcohol, with hydroxyzine hydrochloride 50 mg as a positive internal control, on 
      aspects of cognitive and psychomotor function related to driving a car.
PG  - 1518-38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antihistamines (H(1)-receptor antagonists) are the mainstay of
      symptomatic therapy for allergic disorders. Antihistamines are needed that cause 
      no disruptive effects on cognitive and psychomotor function. It is essential that
      antihistamines maintain the integrity of the cognitive system, not only in
      ambulatory patients at increased risk of drug-induced traffic- or work-related
      accidents, but also in students and others whose cognitive or intellectual
      impairment may adversely affect their performance.Objective; The goal of this
      study was to investigate the acute effects of fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg, 
      alone and with a "social" dose of alcohol, on subjective feelings of sedation and
      on a battery of objective measures related to driving a car. These measures
      included information processing, psychomotor speed, and reaction time in an
      on-the-road car-driving task. Hydroxyzine hydrochloride 50 mg was included in the
      study as a positive internal control to validate the sensitivity of the
      psychometri tests to nonspecific impairment. METHODS: In this randomized,
      double-blind, 6-way, crossover study conducted at the Human Psychopharmacology
      Research Unit, Medical Research Centre (University of Surrey, Guildford, United
      Kingdom), 18 healthy volunteers received fexofenadine 180 mg, hydroxyzine 50 mg, 
      and placebo alone and with alcohol (0.3 g/kg body weight or approximately
      0.43-0.50 g/L blood-alcohol concentration). Treatment periods were separated by a
      washout period of at least 6 days. Subjects performed tests of cognitive and
      psychomotor performance at 1, 3, and 5 and hours after dosing. The test battery
      included subjective ratings of sedation, critical flicker fusion (CFF), choice
      reaction time (including recognition reaction time [RRT], motor reaction time
      [MRT], total reaction time [TRT], and brake reaction time [BRT]. RESULTS:
      Eighteen healthy male volunteers (median age, 30.5 years [range, 23-44 years])
      were entered into the study. Fexofenadine alone and with alcohol had no
      significant effect on performance compared with placebo and was not
      distinguishable from placebo in any of the objective or subjective tests at any
      point. However, impairment was evident following the administration of
      hydroxyzine. Hydroxyzine caused significant impairment in CFF (P < 0.05), RRT (P 
      < 0.001), and TRT (P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Hydroxyzine with alcohol
      significantly disrupted performance on all of the above measures with respect to 
      both placebo and fexofenadine (P < 0.05) as well as MRT (P < 0.001). No
      significant treatment effects on BRT were found. CONCLUSION: Fexofenadine 180 mg 
      did not have disruptive effects on objective measures related to driving a car
      and aspects of psychomotor and cognitive function, even when combined with a dose
      of alcohol equivalent to 0.3 g/kg body weight, in a study in which the
      psychometric assessments were shown to be sensitive to impairment.

TI  - [Multicenter study of the effectiveness and tolerability of desloratadine in
      seasonal allergic rhinitis].
PG  - 1021-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The authors appraised the clinical efficacy of desloratadine in
      patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: An open, two-week trial was conducted on 428 patients between 3 June and
      31 July 2002 in 11 centres. Nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching 
      as well as ocular clinical signs were characterized using a symptom score.
      Desloratadine tablet was administered in 5 mg doses. After two weeks of
      treatment, the symptom score was re-evaluated. Potential adverse events that had 
      occurred during the treatment period were recorded. RESULTS: Desloratadine
      significantly alleviated all four nasal symptoms and ocular effectively. In
      particular, treatment resulted from 76 percent to 12% percent decrease of overall
      symptom score. One of the participants discontinued treatment due to the
      occurrence of adverse effects. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that
      desloratidine is a safe and effective systemic antihistamine--with complex
      antiallergic effect--for the therapy of seasonal allergic rhinitis and
      rhinoconjunctivitis. It can reduce nasal congestion with greater magnitude than
      other known antihistamines.

TI  - Addition of fexofenadine to a topical corticosteroid reduces the pruritus
      associated with atopic dermatitis in a 1-week randomized, multicentre,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.
PG  - 1212-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fexofenadine, a nonsedating, H1-receptor selective antihistamine,
      exhibits consistent efficacy and safety in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and
      urticaria. The pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis is considered to be
      induced, in part, by histamine. Therefore, we thought that fexofenadine may be
      useful in the relief of pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVE: To
      compare the efficacy of twice-daily fexofenadine hydrochloride (HCl) 60 mg vs.
      placebo in reducing the pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis. METHODS: In
      this randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients
      (aged >or= 16 years) with atopic dermatitis underwent a 1-week placebo lead-in
      period, followed by randomization to fexofenadine HCl 60 mg twice daily or
      placebo for 1 week. All patients also received topical treatment with 0.1%
      hydrocortisone butyrate twice daily throughout the study. The primary efficacy
      endpoint was mean change in pruritus score from baseline. Patients reflectively
      recorded pruritus scores twice daily (day and night) using a five-point scale (0 
      = none; 4 = very severe). RESULTS: Fexofenadine (n = 201) significantly decreased
      the severity of pruritus compared with placebo (n = 199) (mean change in score
      -0.75 (unadjusted 95% confidence interval [-0.88, -0.62]) vs. -0.5 [-0.62,
      -0.38], respectively; P = 0.0005). This improvement was seen after just 1 day of 
      treatment (P = 0.039) and was maintained throughout the treatment period (P =
      0.019). Compared with placebo, fexofenadine significantly improved both diurnal
      (P = 0.0001) and nocturnal pruritus (P = 0.013). In addition, significantly more 
      patients in the fexofenadine group experienced a reduction in the ratio of
      pruritus area to body surface area compared with those in the placebo group (P = 
      0.007). The incidence of adverse events was low and similar across all treatment 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Fexofenadine HCl 60 mg twice daily demonstrated a rapid,
      significant improvement in the pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis, with a
      safety profile equivalent to that of placebo.

TI  - The effects of histamine and leukotriene receptor antagonism on nasal mannitol
      challenge in allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 639-42
AB  - AIMS: It is unclear as to which mediators are involved in mediating the response 
      to nasal mannitol challenge, a novel osmotic stimulus. METHODS: A double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design was employed. Nine patients with
      allergic rhinitis were randomized to receive a single-dose of desloratadine 5 mg,
      montelukast 10 mg or placebo, and underwent nasal mannitol challenges with nasal 
      peak inspiratory flow recordings over 60 min. The change in peak nasal
      inspiratory flow was calculated as percentage change from baseline as the peak
      response and area under the time-response curve (AUC). RESULTS: Desloratadine and
      montelukast conferred a significant degree of protection compared to placebo for 
      peak and AUC response, but there were no significant differences between the two 
      drugs. For the peak response as percentage fall, the mean difference (95% CI) vs 
      placebo was 27.7 (8.0, 47.4)% for desloratadine and 17.6 (1.9, 33.3)% for
      montelukast. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that histamine and
      cysteinyl-leukotrienes are involved in mediating the response to nasal mannitol
      in allergic rhinitis.

TI  - [H1 histamine antagonists].
PG  - 95-100
AB  - Histamine is an important mediator for early phase allergic reactions that are
      involved in atopic diseases, mediated by specific IgE antibodies. After
      allergenic contact, its liberation induces unpleasant symptoms like itching,
      several manifestations as local vasodilatation, bronchoconstriction, mucus
      hypersecretion. Antagonists of H1 histamine receptors are the most prescribed
      drugs, due to their symptomatic effects at the levels of nasal or conjunctival
      mucosa, and the skin. Their major indications cover allergic rhinitis, either
      seasonal or perennial, and idiopathic chronic urticaria, as a first line
      medication. The pharmacological evolution allows to distinguish three generations
      of products differing at the levels of specificity, long acting period, and
      toxicity. The authors are discussing the respective benefits of two recent
      molecules presented as 3rd generation molecules: fexofenadine and levocetirizine,
      while repositioning their use among available treatment strategy.

TI  - Supplementation of fexofenadine therapy with nedocromil sodium 2% ophthalmic
      solution to treat ocular symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.
PG  - 206-12
AB  - PURPOSE: Ocular symptoms are often under-treated in patients with allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis. The efficacy of fexofenadine hydrochloride 60 mg capsules
      supplemented with nedocromil sodium 2% ophthalmic solution was evaluated to
      determine the optimal drug regimen for control of ocular allergic symptoms.
      METHODS: In this 5-week, open-label, randomized, multicentre comparative study,
      89 patients with documented ragweed pollen allergy received fexofenadine b.i.d.
      with nedocromil rescue, fexofenadine q.d. with nedocromil b.i.d., or fexofenadine
      rescue with nedocromil b.i.d. during the ragweed pollen season. RESULTS: For all 
      regimens, mean symptom severity scores for itching, burning, tearing, redness,
      grittiness, discharge, light sensitivity and swelling improved significantly (P <
      0.003). Similarly, all groups experienced significant (P < 0.02) improvement in
      all clinical signs: erythema, oedema, discharge, conjunctival injection and
      conjunctivitis, as well as quality-of-life scores (P < 0.0001). All regimens
      reduced overall symptom severity scores after 5 min (P < 0.05) with relief
      persisting over 12 h (P < 0.03). Improvements in mean symptoms, signs and
      quality-of-life scores were similar among the treatment groups as were onset and 
      duration of action even though patients in two of the three study arms were
      taking one-half or less of the recommended fexofenadine dosage. Patients and
      physicians judged the regimens containing lower fexofenadine dosages (with
      nedocromil b.i.d.) to be more effective overall than the regimen containing the
      highest fexo-fenadine dosage (with nedocromil as rescue only). CONCLUSIONS:
      Supplementation of oral fexofenadine therapy with nedocromil sodium 2% ophthalmic
      solution relieves ocular symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis,
      allowing control of rhinal symptoms with half the recommended dosage of
      fexofenadine.

TI  - Fluticasone nasal spray and the combination of loratadine and montelukast in
      seasonal allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 557-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of an intranasal steroid treatment with
      that of the combination of a histamine1 receptor antagonist and a leukotriene D
      receptor antagonist in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. DESIGN: A
      2-week, parallel, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study with rolling
      enrollment. SETTING: Tertiary care medical center. Subjects A total of 63 adults 
      with a 2-year history of ragweed sensitivity in the Chicago, Ill, area and a
      positive skin-prick reaction to ragweed pollen. Intervention Subjects were
      randomized to receive either 100 micro g of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal 
      spray in each nostril or 10 mg of loratadine and 10 mg of montelukast sodium by
      mouth once daily in the evening for 2 weeks. At visits 1 and 2, subjects
      completed a quality-of-life questionnaire and underwent nasal lavage to determine
      total eosinophil count and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) measurements. Daily 
      symptom diaries were kept for 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaire
      answers, daily nasal symptom scores, eosinophil counts, and ECP levels. RESULTS: 
      Median total nasal symptom scores were lower in the fluticasone group (4.5 vs 6),
      but the difference was not statistically significant. The questionnaire answers
      showed dramatic improvement in overall and individual domains for both groups
      (P<.01 vs visit 1) with significantly greater reduction in nasal symptoms in the 
      fluticasone group (P<.05). Eosinophil counts and ECP levels were significantly
      reduced in the fluticasone group. CONCLUSION: Both treatments provided clinically
      meaningful responses, but the overall results favored fluticasone propionate.

TI  - Herbal supplements and skin testing: the lack of effect of commonly used herbal
      supplements on histamine skin prick testing.
PG  - 492-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of herbal supplements is common, yet little is known about
      their pharmacologic properties. The purpose of this study was to assess the
      effects of 23 commonly used herbal supplements on histamine skin prick testing
      (SPT). METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers participated in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, single-dose, crossover study. Wheal and flare responses to
      SPT with histamine phosphate (1 mg/ml) were measured before and 4 h after
      administration of each of the 23 popular herbal supplements, fexofenadine (60 mg)
      and placebo. Wheal and flare areas were recorded with tracings performed 10 min
      after the prick test and measured with a PC-digitizer using stereometric
      software. RESULTS: Fexofenadine significantly suppressed the wheal (P < 0.001)
      and flare (P = 0.02) areas compared with placebo. None of the herbal supplements 
      caused significant suppression of the wheal and flare areas compared with placebo
      (P > 0.10). CONCLUSION: When taken in single-doses, the popular herbal
      supplements tested did not significantly affect the histamine skin response.
      Therefore, it seems unnecessary for clinicians to ask patients to discontinue
      these herbal supplements prior to allergy skin testing.

TI  - Chronic urticaria: a role for newer immunomodulatory drugs?
PG  - 297-305
AB  - Chronic urticaria is now recognized as an autoreactive disorder in a substantial 
      fraction of patients. A serologic mediator of whealing has been demonstrated in
      50-60% of patients with chronic urticaria, and autoantibodies against the high
      affinity IgE receptor or IgE have been detected in about half of these patients. 
      The demonstration that chronic urticaria is frequently autoimmune has encouraged 
      a more aggressive therapeutic approach, with the use of immunomodulatory drugs.A 
      step-by-step approach to the management of chronic urticaria is proposed, based
      on our personal experience and review of current medical literature, identified
      through Medline research and hand searching in medical journals. The non- or
      low-sedating H(1) receptor antagonists (antihistamines), such as cetirizine,
      fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine and, more recently, levocetirizine,
      desloratadine and ebastine, represent the basic therapy for all chronic urticaria
      patients. Older sedating antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine,
      may be indicated if symptoms are severe, are associated with angioedema, and if
      the patient is anxious and disturbed at night.Corticosteroid therapy with
      prednisone or methylprednisolone can be administered for a few days (7-14) if
      urticarial symptoms are not controlled by antihistamines and a rapid clinical
      response is needed. In cases of relapse after corticosteroid suspension,
      leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, should be 
      tried. In our experience, remission of urticarial symptoms can be achieved in
      20-50% of chronic urticaria patients unresponsive to antihistamines alone. When
      urticaria is unremitting and is not controlled by combined therapy with
      antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists, prolonged corticosteroid
      therapy may be needed. Long-term corticosteroid therapy should be administered at
      the lowest dose able to control urticarial symptoms, in order to minimize adverse
      effects. In a few patients, however, high-dose corticosteroid therapy may have to
      be administered for long periods. In these patients, immunosuppressive treatment 
      with low-dose cyclosporine can be started. This type of treatment has a
      corticosteroid-sparing effect and is also generally effective in patients with
      severe, unremitting urticaria, but requires careful monitoring of cyclosporine
      plasma concentration and possible adverse effects. Other immunomodulating drugs
      that have been tried in chronic urticaria patients include hydroxychloroquine,
      dapsone, sulfasalazine and methotrexate, but their efficacy has not been proven
      in large controlled studies. Warfarin therapy may also be considered in some
      patients with chronic urticaria and angioedema unresponsive to antihistamines.

TI  - Aspirin desensitization in patients with AERD.
PG  - 159-68
AB  - All patients with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) can be
      desensitized to ASA. After achieving this state, patients can then take ASA daily
      without adverse effect. ASA desensitization can be maintained indefinitely as
      long as the patient takes ASA each day. Crossdesensitization with older NSAIDs
      also occurs. After ASA desensitization, patients can take daily ASA in order to
      treat their underlying respiratory disease. In AERD patients treated with ASA 650
      BID for at least a year, 115/172 (67%) improved in their clinical courses while
      decreasing systemic and topical corticosteroids. Sixteen failed to improve, 24
      stopped ASA because of intractable side effects (gastritis or hives) and 17
      patients discontinued ASA treatment in the first year of study for unrelated
      reasons. Therefore, treatment with daily ASA is a significant therapeutic option 
      for patients afflicted with AERD. It should be used for AERD patients who do not 
      respond to topical corticosteroids and leukotriene modifier drugs. Those who
      respond to systemic steroids or have intractable or recurrent nasal polyps are
      particularly well-suited for this therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of desloratadine 5 mg once daily in the treatment of chronic 
      idiopathic urticaria: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 535-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) has a major impact on patient
      well-being. Antihistamines are the first-line treatment for CIU; however, some
      cause sedation. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the efficacy and safety of
      desloratadine, 5 mg, a new H(1)-receptor antagonist, in patients with moderate to
      severe CIU. METHODS: This study was a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial of 6 weeks' duration.
      RESULTS: Compared with placebo, desloratadine significantly improved the total
      CIU symptom score as well as pruritus, the number of hives, and the size of the
      largest hive. Overall therapeutic response and global CIU status improved
      significantly with desloratadine; interference with sleep was reduced and the
      performance of daily activities improved. Statistically and clinically
      significant improvements were seen within the first 24 hours of treatment and
      were sustained throughout the full duration of the study. The incidence of
      adverse events, including somnolence, was similar in the desloratadine and
      placebo groups. CONCLUSION: Desloratadine is a well-tolerated and effective
      treatment of CIU.

TI  - Successful mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells after addition of ancestim
      (stem cell factor) in patients who had failed a prior mobilization with
      filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) alone or with chemotherapy
      plus filgrastim.
PG  - 371-8
AB  - This study assessed the ability of recombinant human stem cell factor (rHuSCF) to
      mobilize stem cells in 44 patients who had failed a prior mobilization (CD34(+)
      yield 0.5-1.9 x 10(6)/kg BW) with filgrastim-alone or
      chemotherapy-plus-filgrastim. The same mobilization regimen was used with the
      addition of rHuSCF. In the filgrastim-alone group (n=13), rHuSCF 20 microg/kg was
      started 3 days before filgrastim and continued for the duration of filgrastim. In
      the chemotherapy-plus-filgrastim group (n=31), rHuSCF 20 microg/kg/day plus
      filgrastim 5-10 microg/kg/day were administered concurrently. Leukaphereses were 
      continued to a maximum of four procedures or a target of >or=3 x 10(6) CD34(+)
      cells/kg. In both groups, CD34(+) yield (x 10(6)/kg BW) of the study mobilization
      was higher than that of the prior mobilization (median: 2.42 vs 0.84 P=0.002 and 
      1.64 vs 0.99 P=<0.001, respectively). In all 54 and 45% of patients in the
      filgrastim-alone group and chemotherapy-plus-filgrastim group, respectively,
      reached the threshold yield of 2 x 10(6)/kg. The probability of a successful
      mobilization was the same in those with a CD34+ yield of 0.5-0.75 x 10(6)/kg BW
      in the prior mobilization as in those with 0.76-1.99 x 10(6)/kg BW.
      Downmodulation of c-kit expression and a lower percentage of Thy-1 positivity in 
      the mobilized CD34(+) cells were noted in the successful mobilizers compared with
      those in the poor mobilizers. This study shows that rhuSCF is effective in
      approximately half the patients who had failed a prior mobilization and allows
      them to proceed to transplant. It also points to the likely role of the SCF/c-kit
      ligand pair in mobilization.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of selegiline
      transdermal system without dietary restrictions in patients with major depressive
      disorder.
PG  - 208-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: The monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor selegiline has demonstrated
      antidepressant efficacy superior to placebo. A selegiline transdermal system
      (STS) has been developed with unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      properties that allow inhibition of central nervous system MAO-A and MAO-B
      enzymes while substantially avoiding inhibition of intestinal and liver MAO-A
      enzyme. This novel transdermal system provides targeted MAO inhibition without
      clinically significant increases in sensitivity to dietary tyramine. We
      investigated the safety and efficacy of STS in patients with major depressive
      disorder. METHOD: 365 outpatients 18 to 65 years old with a DSM-IV diagnosis of
      major depressive disorder were enrolled at 16 sites. A 17-item Hamilton Rating
      Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) score of > or = 20 was required for entry.
      Patients were randomly assigned to receive either STS, 20 mg/20 cm(2), daily or
      placebo patch for up to 8 weeks. A tyramine-restricted diet was neither required 
      nor advised. Efficacy, safety, and vital sign measures were obtained regularly.
      RESULTS: 289 patients were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least 1
      on-therapy evaluation (STS, N = 145; placebo, N = 144). Although the effect size 
      was modest, at endpoint, STS was statistically superior to placebo on the MADRS
      (p =.001) and HAM-D-28 (p =.039) ratings and showed a nonsignificant superiority 
      on the HAM-D-17 (p =.069) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity ratings (p
      <.055). Side effect profiles were similar for STS and placebo with the exception 
      of application-site reaction, which was observed in 31.5% of STS patients and
      15.1% of placebo-treated patients (p =.001). No significant differences were
      observed in blood pressure measures between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Results
      from this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrate that STS
      may have a modest, but statistically significant, antidepressant benefit compared
      with placebo and a similar safety profile compared with placebo in the absence of
      a tyramine-restricted diet.

TI  - Plasma serotonin and histamine levels in hemodialysis-related pruritus are not
      significantly influenced by 5-HT3 receptor blocker and antihistaminic therapy.
PG  - 124-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma histamine levels are considered to play a part in the
      pathophysiology of hemodialysis-related pruritus. However, antihistaminic therapy
      often fails to provide sufficient relief. Elevated serotonin levels in patients
      on dialysis therapy have also been described but the effects of 5-HT3 receptor
      antagonists on hemodialysis-related pruritus remain controversial. METHODS: we
      conducted a study to determine plasma histamine and serotonin levels before and
      after treatment with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (tropisetron 5 mg and ondansetron
      8 mg) and an antihistamine (cetirizine 10 mg). Eleven hemodialysis patients with 
      a history of pruritus participated in this study,10 healthy volunteers served as 
      control group. RESULTS: Histamine and serotonin values were normal in patients
      and controls. Treatment with cetirizine did not significantly reduce histamine
      levels in patients or in controls. Tropisetron and ondansetron likewise did not
      alter serotonin levels in patients. Tropisetron treatment did not significantly
      change serotonin levels in controls. CONCLUSION: Histamine and serotonin are no
      major mediators of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. Elevated histamine levels
      are occassionally seen and may be due to the increased mast cell number found in 
      a subgroup of hemodialysis patients. Our findings explain the only marginal
      relief of antihistamines and the controversial antipruritic effect of serotonin
      receptor antagonists in hemodialysis-related pruritus.

TI  - Desloratadine: a nonsedating antihistamine.
PG  - 237-46; quiz 313-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review information on desloratadine, a nonsedating antihistamine.
      DATA SOURCES: An English-language MEDLINE search was conducted (1966-July 2002). 
      References of identified articles were subsequently reviewed for additional data.
      Schering Corporation provided unpublished information. STUDY SELECTION/DATA
      EXTRACTION: Articles and abstracts pertaining to desloratadine were considered
      for inclusion, with emphasis on randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
      trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Desloratadine is approved for the treatment of symptoms
      associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), perennial allergic rhinitis
      (PAR), and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) in patients aged > or =12 years. In
      placebo-controlled trials, desloratadine demonstrated superior efficacy as a
      once-daily treatment of SAR, PAR, and CIU. Data suggest that desloratadine has
      antiinflammatory and decongestant activity. CONCLUSIONS: Desloratadine appears to
      be a "me-too" agent, with no major differences compared with other
      second-generation antihistamines.

TI  - Failure of cetirizine and fexofenadine to prevent motion sickness.
PG  - 173-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of 2 second-generation antihistamines
      in modulating motion sickness induced by Coriolis vestibular cross-coupling
      stimulation. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover,
      placebo-controlled study was conducted in 18 healthy adults. Subjects were
      exposed to Coriolis vestibular cross-coupling in the laboratory using the
      Staircase Profile Test for baseline susceptibility and when under the influence
      of cetizirine, fexofenadine, and placebo. Subjective evaluation of sickness
      symptoms was based on the Graybiel diagnostic criteria of acute motion sickness, 
      Golding's scale, and the Coriolis Sickness Susceptibility Index. RESULTS:
      Repeated measures ANOVA and Friedman nonparametric ANOVA of rank tests revealed
      that there were significant differences in symptom assessments based on
      Graybiel's diagnostic criteria (p < or = 0.001), subjective symptoms of motion
      sickness (p < or = 0.001), and state-anxiety (p < or = 0.001) before and after
      motion exposure. However, there are no significant differences between the
      baseline susceptibility to motion sickness and treatment with placebo,
      cetirizine, or fexofenadine. CONCLUSIONS: The failure of the second-generation
      antihistamines cetirizine and fexofenadine to prevent motion sickness suggests
      that the therapeutic actions of this class of antihistamines against motion
      sickness may be mediated through central versus peripheral receptors. The
      sedative effect of other antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine, may play a more
      significant role in alleviating motion sickness than previously thought.

TI  - Why aren't lower, effective, OTC doses available earlier by prescription?
PG  - 136-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many popular oral over-the-counter (OTC) drugs were originally
      available only by prescription, but not at the low doses contained in their OTC
      counterparts. Yet, if OTC doses are effective for treating mild symptoms, why
      weren't these low, often safer doses made available at least by prescription when
      the drugs were first approved? OBJECTIVE: To examine issues surrounding the
      delayed approval of OTC doses by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS:
      Information reviewed included package inserts, data obtained from manufacturers, 
      and articles published in MEDLINE (1966 to December 2001). Medications examined
      included presently available and potentially approved OTC antiinflammatory,
      gastrointestinal, and antihistamine drugs. RESULTS: Considerable data demonstrate
      the effectiveness of ibuprofen, naproxen, ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine,
      diphenhydramine, and clemastine at OTC doses. Published studies also show the
      effectiveness of celecoxib, omeprazole, and fexofenadine at doses 33-50% lower
      than currently recommended for prescription use. CONCLUSIONS: OTC doses are
      effective for many patients with mild symptoms and for some with serious
      symptoms. However, OTC-like doses are usually not offered when drugs are approved
      for prescription use because new drugs are usually studied in patients with
      serious conditions requiring higher doses; manufacturers and the FDA seem to
      prefer a middle-dose approach; >75% of subjects in premarketing dose studies are 
      male; and averaging the responses of study subjects may obscure a wide range of
      interindividual variation in drug response. Simplistic dosage guidelines make
      therapeutic decisions easier. Because dose-related adverse effects frequently
      diminish quality-of-life and reduce adherence, the early availability of OTC-like
      doses, at least by prescription, would allow healthcare professionals greater
      flexibility in matching medication doses to patients' widely differing needs.

TI  - Rapid effects of olopatadine hydrochloride on the histamine-induced skin
      responses.
PG  - 709-12
AB  - Olopatadine hydrochloride is one of the second-generation nonsedating
      antihistamines that are used for treating allergic disorders such as urticaria,
      rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. We examined the inhibitory effects of this drug 
      on the flare and wheal responses induced by histamine iontophoresis at 30, 60,
      and 90 min after oral administration in a double-blind, cross-over, and
      placebo-controlled study. Olopatadine hydrochloride significantly inhibited the
      histamine-induced flare and wheal responses as early as 60 min after oral
      administration when compared with placebo. Significant inihibitory effects of
      olopatadine hydrochloride on the itch responses were seen at 90 min after
      administration. Thus, olopatadine hydrochloride exhibited a very rapid and potent
      antihistamine effect on the histamine-induced skin responses.

TI  - Optimising parameters for peripheral blood leukapheresis after r-metHuG-CSF
      (filgrastim) and r-metHuSCF (ancestim) in patients with multiple myeloma: a
      temporal analysis of CD34(+) absolute counts and subsets.
PG  - 851-60
AB  - Patients (n = 69) with multiple myeloma undergoing peripheral blood stem cell
      collection (PBSC) were treated with cyclophosphamide and a combination of
      recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF, 
      filgrastim) and recombinant methionyl human stem cell factor (r-metHuSCF,
      ancestim). The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) The proportion of 
      patients reaching a target yield of >or=5 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg in one or two 
      successive large-volume (20 liter) leukapheresis procedures; (2) the optimal
      collection time for leukapheresis; (3) mobilization kinetics of CD34(+) subsets
      in response to G-CSF/SCF. All patients were mobilized with cyclophosphamide (2.5 
      g/m(2)) on day 0 followed by filgrastim (10 microg/kg ) plus ancestim (20
      microg/kg) commencing day 1 and continuing to day 11 or 12. Of the 65 evaluable
      patients, 57 were considered not heavily pretreated and 96.5% obtained a target
      of >or=5 x 10(6)/kg in one collection. The median CD34(+) cells/kg was 39.5 x
      10(6) (range: 5.2-221.2 x 10(6)). Subset analysis demonstrated the number of
      CD38(-), CD33(-), and CD133(+) peaked at day 11; and CD34(+), CD90(+) cells
      peaked at day 10. The optimum day for leukapheresis was determined to be day 11. 
      The median absolute peripheral blood CD34(+) cell numbers on day 11 was 665 x
      10(6)/l (range: 76-1481 x 10(6)/l). Eight of the 10 heavily pretreated patients
      were evaluable: three achieved the target dose in one leukapheresis (37.5%) and
      three (37.5%) achieved the target dose with two leukaphereses. Use of this
      mobilization strategy allowed the collection of high numbers of CD34(+) cells and
      early progenitors and the ability to predictably schedule leukapheresis.

TI  - Roles of histamine in regulation of arousal and cognition: functional
      neuroimaging of histamine H1 receptors in human brain.
PG  - 409-14
AB  - Brain histamine is involved in a wide range of physiological functions such as
      regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, arousal, cognition, and memory mainly through
      interactions with histamine H1 receptors (H1Rs). Neurons producing histamine,
      histaminergic neurons, are exclusively located in the posterior hypothalamus and 
      transmit histamine to almost all regions of the brain. Histamine H1 antagonists, 
      or antihistamines, often prescribed for treatment of allergic disorders,
      sometimes induce sleepiness and cognitive deficits. It is understood that the
      mechanism of such CNS side effects is that antihistamine blocks H1Rs in the
      brain. The purpose of the present study was to compare the CNS side effects of
      different antihistamines. Subjective sleepiness was measured using the Stanford
      Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and psychomotor performance was examined by a
      tachistoscope testing system in healthy, young, Japanese volunteers (16 males,
      20-28 yrs.) before and after oral administration of antihistamines such as
      fexofenadine (FEX) and cetirizine (CET). Additionally, H1R occupancy by
      antihistamines was examined by PET with 11C-doxepin in 8 volunteers. The results 
      of SSS and psychomotor tests demonstrated that FEX tended to be less sedative
      than CET though the difference was not statistically significant. PET
      measurements revealed that no H1Rs in the cerebral cortex were occupied by FEX
      while about 30% of H1Rs were occupied by CET. In summary, it was confirmed that
      histamine and H1Rs are involved in maintaining arousal and cognition in humans,
      and that the severity of clinical symptoms is correlated to the amount of
      antihistamine that penetrated into the brain.

TI  - [Immunotherapy with an oral Alternaria extract in childhood asthma. Clinical
      safety and efficacy and effects on in vivo and in vitro parameters].
PG  - 319-30
AB  - Studies of immunotherapy with oral Alternaria extracts are scarce. We decided to 
      perform a clinical trial of the clinical safety and efficacy of this extract as
      well as of its effects on in vivo and in vitro parameters in 39 patients with
      Alternaria allergy, aged between 7 and 17 years, who are also sensitized extract 
      was used. Allergic activity was determined through RAST inhibition and skin prick
      test. Quantification of the principal allerten (Alt a 1) was performed through
      the 2-site binding assay, with a mean content of 34.2 ng Alt a 1/micro g protein.
      The parameters analyzed were the symptom-medication score, skin prick using the
      end-point technique, specific bronchial challenge test, peak flow, total and
      specific IgE and IgG4. Nineteen patiens received active treatment with oral
      immunotherapy and another 19 received symptomatic treatment. The initial phase of
      immunotherapy lasted 3 months until the maximum dose was reached. This was
      maintained for 12 months; the mean accumulated dos was 280,000 PNU. Significant
      differences were found in reduction in the symptom-medication score in the
      treated group after 12 months of immunotherapy. No differences were found in the 
      control group. Immunotherapy was well tolerated with 0.42 adverse reactions per
      100 doses administered. All adverse reactions were mild-to-moderate. In the
      treated group, papule size was significantly reduced. Values for the specific
      bronchial challenge test, expressed through PD20, were significantly higher in
      the immunotherapy group. Peak flow showed no changes in either group. Values of
      IgG4 were significantly higher in the immunotherapy group. Total and specific IgE
      levels showed no significant changes in either group. In conclusion, oral
      immunotherapy with Alternaria extract is clinically effective in pediatric
      patients. In general, the therapy was well tolerated. It modified specific
      cutaneous and bronchial reactivity in our sample and increased levels of specific
      IgG4, wich are implicated in humoral response.

TI  - Dermal objective pharmacodynamic profile of cetirizine and epinastine: two
      controlled, randomised, double-blind, crossover studies.
PG  - 568-73
AB  - Two double-blind clinical pharmacology studies were performed in healthy
      volunteers to compare the dermal pharmacodynamic profile of epinastine with
      cetirizine, a well-documented anti-H1 antagonist, after oral administration at
      the usual recommended dosage, i.e. 10 mg cetirizine and 20 mg epinastine (versus 
      placebo). Histamine skin challenges (prick test) were evaluated before and at 1, 
      2, 4, 8 and 24 hr after drug intake by measuring the wheal and flare area
      (studies 1 and 2) along with laser Doppler monitoring of the microvascular
      responses (study 2). A decrease in wheal and flare areas was observed following
      intake of both drugs compared with placebo controls. With the notable exception
      of 1 hr post dose wheal values, which were consistently smaller after epinastine,
      cetirizine was superior to epinastine for both wheal and flare at all other
      times. At the prick test site, treatment with epinastine and cetirizine
      accentuated the increase in blood flow induced by histamine. This reflects the
      decrease of the whealing but there was no significant difference between the two 
      active test compounds. At 1 cm from the prick test site, the administration of
      both active treatments inhibited the increase of blood flow, and cetirizine
      showed a more potent inhibitory effect from 8 hr post dose. This reflects the
      reduction of the flare induced after histamine-receptor activation of the axon
      reflex. In conclusion, epinastine shows a rapidly greater (within 1 hr post dose 
      on the wheal only) but vanishing effect than cetirizine. At all other time
      points, cetirizine was generally more effective than epinastine.

TI  - [Cold urticaria: review of 12 cases].
PG  - 259-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cold urticaria is caused after exposition to cold air, water and
      food. It is the third more frequent physical urticaria in pediatric population.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed twelve patients, studied different
      characteristics and obtained following results: mean age is 12 years and 9 months
      and it is more frequent in female subjects, atopy is present in 67 % of patients,
      other physical urticaria are present in 25 % and there is not familial
      inheritance. 83 % of patients have localized and generalized symptoms. Cold
      stimulation test is positive in 92 %. Cryoglobulins and cold agglutinins are
      negative in 100 % of patients in which these tests were made. There is infectious
      disease in only two patients. Cetirizine was used in most of patients and it was 
      successful in 70 %. Mean duration is 3 years and 6 months. Only patient with
      negative cold stimulation test remains without symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Cold
      urticaria must be initially diagnosed by cold stimulation test and clinical
      history. Cetirizine is effective and cause less adverse effects than other
      antihistamines traditionally used.

TI  - The use of handheld computers in clinical trials.
PG  - 469-80
AB  - A recently completed, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial 
      is presented in which Palm handheld computers were used as a substitute for
      normal paper-based patient diaries. In this nasal provocation study, a common
      antihistamine approved for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was tested
      against placebo for evidence of additional properties. In addition to their
      medical examinations, the 12 study volunteers rated subjective complaints in a
      diary program on 4 examination days, for a duration of 4.5 hours every 15 minutes
      at each visit. This resulted in 903 data sets consisting of five questions each, 
      or 4515 data points total. In this study the use of handheld computers resulted
      in an increase in data quality and shortened the time needed to close the
      database. Moreover, the benefit of electronic reminders for protocol compliance
      is clearly demonstrated. Our findings support the results found in the literature
      we reviewed. For more than 16 years, mobile computers have been supporting the
      implementation of clinical trials. Our review of 27 articles out of more than 100
      clinical trials in which mobile computers have been used elaborates on the
      advantages and problems of this technology. We give a comprehensive overview of
      the various technologies as used in different settings, and then discuss the
      methodology of using mobile devices in comparison to traditional methods, the
      considerations that need to be made and things to be avoided in order to conduct 
      a successful clinical trial with mobile tools. We conclude that mobile devices
      are very useful in most cases, especially when design and software validation
      aspects have been taken into account.

TI  - A comparative study of the side effects between pseudoephedrine in Loratadine
      plus Pseudoephedrine Sulfate Repetabs Tables and loratadine + pseudoephedrine
      tablet in treatment of allergic rhinitis in Thai patients.
PG  - 722-7
AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the adverse reactions of Loratadine
      plus Pseudoephedrine Sulfate Repetabs Tables (LTD+PSE Repetabs) (Loratadine 5 mg 
      + Pseudoephedrine 120 mg) twice daily with that of loratadine (5 mg) twice daily 
      and pseudoephedrine (60 mg) quarter daily in the treatment of patients with
      allergic rhinitis. The study was designed as an investigator-blind, parallel
      group study. In this study, 56 patients were equally separated into 2 groups and 
      treated for 14 days with either LTD+PSE Repetabs or loratadine + pseudoephedrine 
      tablet. Both groups were comparable in age, gender, weight; baseline systolic
      blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate. The change of systolic
      blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate did not reach clinical
      significance throughout the study period. There was no significant difference in 
      occurrences of insomnia, palpitation, mouth dryness and anxiety. However, the
      incidence of patients with tremor at day 14 in the loratadine + pseudoephedrine
      tablet group was significantly higher than the LTD+PSE Repetabs group (39% vs
      10.7%, p-value = 0.03). Furthermore, one patient in the loratadine +
      pseudoephedrine tablet group had to discontinue medication at day 7 due to
      insomnia. In conclusion, LTD+PSE Repetabs is well tolerated and has fewer adverse
      effects when compared to the loratadine + pseudoephedrine tablet.

TI  - Single-patient drug trial methodology for allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 1366-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically, single-patient trials (SPTs) have been specifically
      designed for each patient, requiring significant time and effort for execution.
      There has been no previous attempt to standardize an SPT for routine commercial
      availability. OBJECTIVE: To validate the use of an SPT method to discriminate
      effectiveness and adverse events while comparing drugs/doses in patients with
      allergic rhinitis. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, 4 paired-period,
      multiple-crossover SPT. SETTING: Academic and commercial investigative sites.
      PATIENTS: Thirty-six patients with allergic rhinitis were evaluated for the most 
      appropriate treatment; 6 of these participated in 2 different SPTs.
      INTERVENTIONS: Treatment of symptoms of allergic rhinitis by comparing either
      loratadine with chlorpheniramine maleate or loratadine with placebo in a series
      of SPTs. MEASUREMENTS: Effectiveness endpoints were selected from a modern, Food 
      and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved new drug application. Expected adverse
      events were directly solicited; unsolicited events were also recorded. Total
      signs and symptoms cumulatively included sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, teary 
      eyes, and itchy eyes. Quality of life was measured by the most bothersome symptom
      and the patient's global evaluation. RESULTS: Of 42 initiated SPTs, 40 (95%)
      provided complete data and 1 (2%) provided partial data, resulting in 41 (98%)
      evaluable tests. Thirty-one evaluable SPTs compared loratadine 10 mg/d with
      chlorpheniramine maleate 12 mg twice daily, and 10 SPTs compared loratadine 10
      mg/d with placebo. Four of 31 SPTs (13%) showed significant superiority for
      loratadine over chlorpheniramine maleate and 5 of 31 (16%) for chlorpheniramine
      maleate over loratadine. Twenty-two of 31 (71%) showed parity performance between
      loratadine and chlorpheniramine maleate. Loratadine was significantly superior to
      placebo in 3 of 10 trials (30%), consistent with rates found in 3 pivotal group
      trials used for FDA approval (24%, 17%, and 0%). Sleepiness could be
      discriminated for loratadine versus placebo and for chlorpheniramine maleate
      versus loratadine. CONCLUSIONS: The allergic rhinitis SPT proved to be acceptable
      to patients, feasible to administer, and reproducible. It can statistically
      discriminate effectiveness and adverse events, serving as a useful, prognostic
      tool in community practice.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy of combined fluticasone propionate and olopatadine
      versus combined fluticasone propionate and fexofenadine for the treatment of
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis induced by conjunctival allergen challenge.
PG  - 1161-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: One approach to treating allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is the
      concomitant use of an intranasal spray such as fluticasone propionate to
      alleviate nasal symptoms and a topical or systemic agent to relieve ocular
      symptoms. It has not yet been determined whether a topical or systemic agent is
      more effective for the latter purpose. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the
      efficacy of combined use of fluticasone and olopatadine with combined use of
      fluticasone and fexofenadine in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. METHODS: This 2-site, randomized, double-masked,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study employed the conjunctival allergen
      challenge (CAC) model, a standardized method of inducing ocular and nasal signs
      and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. At visit 1, subjects underwent CAC 
      to determine the dose of allergen required to elicit a positive reaction. The
      allergen dose was confirmed at visit 2, and, according to a randomization
      schedule, subjects were dispensed fluticasone, olopatadine, and placebo pill;
      fluticasone, fexofenadine, and tear substitute; or placebo nasal spray, placebo
      pill, and tear substitute. CAC took place at visit 3, after patients had used the
      assigned medications for 2 weeks. Study medication was instilled 2 hours before
      CAC, after which allergic signs and symptoms were graded on standardized scales. 
      The primary efficacy variables were ocular itching, ocular redness, and overall
      nasal symptoms. RESULTS: Eighty subjects completed the study: 30 received
      fluticasone and olopatadine, 30 fluticasone and fexofenadine, and 20 placebo.
      Women constituted 63.8% of the study population and men 36.3%; 91.3% were white, 
      3.8% black, 2.5% Hispanic, 1.3% Asian, and 1.3% other. Concomitant use of
      fluticasone and olopatadine produced significantly greater improvements in ocular
      itching at 3 and 7 minutes after CAC compared with fluticasone and fexofenadine
      (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in redness scores between
      groups; however, concomitant use of fluticasone and olopatadine produced
      significantly greater improvements in redness at 2 time points in each of the 3
      vessel beds (ciliary, conjunctival, and episcleral) compared with placebo, and
      fluticasone and fexofenadine produced significantly greater improvement in
      redness at 1 time point in I vessel bed compared with placebo (both comparisons, 
      P < 0.05). The 2 treatments had similar effects on total nasal symptom efficacy
      scores. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, concomitant use of the topical agents
      fluticasone and olopatadine was more effective than concomitant use of
      fluticasone plus fexofenadine for overall treatment of the signs and symptoms of 
      induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

PG  - 37-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to assess the electrocardiographic safety and
      pharmacokinetics of desloratadine in combination with the CYP3A4 inhibitor
      ketoconazole. DESIGN: A randomised, placebo-controlled, third-party-blind, 2-way 
      crossover study. PARTICIPANTS: 24 healthy volunteers (12 men, 12 women; age 19 to
      50 years). INTERVENTIONS: 7.5mg of desloratadine orally per day in combination
      with placebo or with 200mg of ketoconazole every 12 hours for 10 days. After a
      minimum 7-day washout period, participants received the alternative treatment.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ECG parameters. RESULTS: Comparable maximum corrected QT
      (QT(c)) intervals were observed after coadministration of desloratadine and
      placebo or ketoconazole (431 and 435 msec, respectively). The
      desloratadine/ketoconazole combination did not induce any statistically
      significant or clinically relevant changes in QT(c), QT, PR or QRS intervals
      compared with desloratadine alone; ventricular rate was slightly slower when
      desloratadine was given with ketoconazole. At steady state, coadministration of
      ketoconazole resulted in no significant change in area under the desloratadine
      concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 24 hours compared with
      desloratadine/placebo. Coadministration of desloratadine and ketoconazole
      resulted in a 1.3-fold increase in desloratadine maximum concentration (C(max))
      that was not clinically relevant. The most common adverse event was headache,
      reported in 42 and 38% of individuals, respectively, after coadministration of
      desloratadine/placebo and desloratadine/ketoconazole. There were no reports of
      dizziness or syncope. CONCLUSION: Coadministration of desloratadine and
      ketoconazole was well tolerated and was associated with minimal increase in AUC
      and C(max). The combination did not induce any clinically relevant
      electrocardiographic changes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the bioavailability, cardiac safety and tolerability of
      desloratadine when given in combination with the CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin.
      DESIGN: A randomised, 2-way crossover, placebo-controlled, third party-blind,
      multiple dose study. PARTICIPANTS: 24 healthy volunteers (12 men, 12 women) aged 
      19 to 46 years. INTERVENTIONS: Oral desloratadine 7.5mg daily in combination with
      either placebo (n = 24) or erythromycin 500mg every 8 hours (n = 24) for 10 days.
      After a minimum 7-day washout period, participants crossed over to the
      alternative regimen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ECG parameters. RESULTS:
      Desloratadine/erythromycin did not induce clinically or statistically significant
      changes in any ECG parameter. The maximum corrected QT (QT(c)) interval was 445
      msec for both treatments. The peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours of desloratadine were slightly
      increased by 1.2- and 1.1-fold by concomitant administration of erythromycin
      compared with desloratadine/placebo. Gastrointestinal adverse events were more
      frequent after desloratadine/erythromycin than desloratadine/placebo (46 vs 4%), 
      reflecting the poor gastrointestinal tolerability of erythromycin. There were no 
      reports of syncope. CONCLUSION: Combined desloratadine/erythromycin therapy was
      well tolerated and had no clinically relevant electrocardiographic effects at a
      dose that was 50% higher than the recommended dose of 5mg. Although
      coadministration of erythromycin slightly increased plasma concentrations of
      desloratadine, this change did not correlate with any prolongation of the QT(c)
      interval, and no toxicity was observed clinically.

TI  - The combination of single-dose montelukast and loratadine on exercise-induced
      bronchospasm in children.
PG  - 104-7
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the protective effect of single-dose,
      combination treatment comprising montelukast (5 mg) and loratadine (10 mg), on
      exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic children. The combination was
      compared to placebo, loratadine and montelukast alone. Nineteen children were
      enrolled in a double-blind randomised, single-dose, crossover study. For each
      treatment patients undertook two treadmill exercise tests, 2 and 12 h
      respectively after single-dose administration. No significant differences were
      seen in the maximum fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 2 h
      after treatment and placebo. Whereas significant differences in maximum fall in
      FEV1 were observed between treatment groups 12 h after administration. Loratadine
      alone did not show any significant protection or any additional effect in
      comparison with montelukast alone. Single doses of montelukast and montelukast
      plus loratadine were significantly more effective than loratadine at 12 h. The
      present study, performed using single-dose treatments, demonstrated that maximal 
      protective effect by montelukast was obtained 12 h after dosing and that
      montelukast plus loratadine did not result in significant additive
      bronchoprotective effects on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

TI  - 24-hour efficacy of once-daily desloratadine therapy in patients with seasonal
      allergic rhinitis [ISRCTN32042139].
PG  - 14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early studies with desloratadine demonstrated efficacy in treating
      seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). A dose-ranging study was conducted to
      characterize its 24-hour efficacy in patients with SAR. METHODS: Patients (N =
      1,026) were randomly assigned once-daily (QD) desloratadine (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, or 
      20 mg) for 2 weeks in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The end point of 
      24-hour efficacy was assessed by the mean change from baseline in the average AM 
      instantaneous total symptom score (TSS) over the treatment period. Day 2 data
      were assessed for efficacy of desloratadine following the first dose. Other
      efficacy variables included AM/PM previous total nasal and nonnasal symptom
      scores and individual symptom scores. RESULTS: Desloratadine 5-20 mg was
      significantly (P <.01) more effective than placebo in improving total AM
      instantaneous TSS and AM/PM previous total nasal and nonnasal symptom scores.
      This dosing range also was significantly (P <.01) more effective than placebo for
      reducing AM instantaneous TSS beginning with the first dose; thus, demonstrating 
      the full 24-hour efficacy of desloratadine. AM/PM previous scores for all
      individual symptoms, including nasal congestion, were also significantly improved
      versus placebo (P <.05) with desloratadine at 5, 7.5, and 20 mg. All treatments
      were well tolerated. There were no clinically meaningful changes in
      electrocardiogram parameters. CONCLUSION: Desloratadine 5-20 mg provided
      significant 24-hour relief of SAR signs and symptoms. There were no statistically
      significant differences between the 4 largest doses suggesting that desloratadine
      5 mg QD offers the best therapeutic profile for patients with SAR.

TI  - Long-term evaluation of the impact of the h1-receptor antagonist cetirizine on
      the behavioral, cognitive, and psychomotor development of very young children
      with atopic dermatitis.
PG  - 251-7
AB  - The impact of the prolonged use of cetirizine at high dose (0.25 mg/kg twice a
      day over 18 mo) on behavior and cognitive ability was examined in a double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ETAC-Early Treatment of the Atopic Child)
      designed to establish whether it was possible to prevent young children (1-2 y
      old at study entry) with atopic dermatitis from developing asthma. Well-validated
      and standardized measures of behavior (Behavior Screening Questionnaire) and
      cognition (McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities) were used. In addition, the
      ages of attainment of psychomotor milestones were established. These measures
      were taken between an average of 32 and 53 mo of age, both during the study
      treatment with cetirizine or placebo and after the study treatment had been
      discontinued. The Behavior Screening Questionnaire was completed at least once on
      approximately 300 children in each group and on approximately 200 children on
      five occasions. The McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities were administered to 
      approximately 100 in each group at three different times. There were no
      significant differences between the cetirizine and placebo groups on either of
      the behavior and cognition measures or in psychomotor milestones during or after 
      the study treatment. These findings suggest that there are no adverse effects on 
      behavior or learning processes associated with the prolonged use of cetirizine in
      young children with atopic dermatitis.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy and safety of loratadine syrup in childhood atopic
      dermatitis treated with mometasone furoate 0.1 per cent cream.
PG  - 482-7
AB  - Atopic dermatitis is a common skin disease in Thai children. The treatment of
      atopic dermatitis requires topical corticosteroids, emollients, systemic
      antihistamine as well as avoidance of the precipitating factors. A double blind
      multicenter placebo controlled study was conducted to assess the therapeutic
      efficacy of topical mometasone furoate 0.1 per cent cream in combination with
      loratadine syrup. Forty-eight patients, 23 boys and 25 girls, mean age 73.67
      months, with atopic dermatitis were included in the study. The severity of the
      disease was measured by using the SCORAD index including the degree of erythema, 
      dryness, edema/papulation, oozing/crusting, lichenification, and excoriation.
      Total area involved was measured and a target area of dermatitis was selected for
      specific evaluation. The degree of clinical signs and pruritic symptom was
      graded. The sensation of pruritus, disturbance of sleep due to pruritus, and
      feeling of sleepiness in the morning were recorded. Mometasone furoate 0.1 per
      cent cream was applied to all patients once daily. One group received loratadine 
      syrup and another group received placebo syrup. They were followed-up on day 5, 8
      and 15. The severity of atopic dermatitis and pruritus significantly decreased
      after 14 days of treatment in both groups (p < 0.001). There was no difference in
      therapeutic response between the loratadine and placebo groups (p = 0.99). All
      signs examined had decreased by the end of the study. The result demonstrated
      that 0.1 per cent mometasone therapy is very effective for treating childhood
      atopic dermatitis. Loratadine did not show beneficial effect when combined with
      good topical corticosteroid but it was safe and had no serious side effect on the
      children.

TI  - Lack of effect of single and repeated doses of levocetirizine, a new
      antihistamine drug, on cognitive and psychomotor functions in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 51-8
AB  - AIMS: Levocetirizine (R-cetirizine), is the active enantiomer of cetirizine, an
      antihistamine indicated in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic
      idiopathic urticaria. The purpose of this trial was to analyse the effects of
      levocetirizine single and multiple doses on CNS using integrated measures of
      cognitive and psychometric performance. METHODS: A battery of psychometric tests 
      was used: critical flicker fusion (CFF), choice reaction time (CRT), body sway
      (BS), learning memory test (LMT) and subjective assessments of alertness compared
      with placebo. Nineteen (19) healthy male volunteers received either
      levocetirizine 5 mg (therapeutic dose), diphenhydramine 50 mg or placebo once
      daily for 5 consecutive days (3-way cross-over). Diphenhydramine was used as a
      positive control. CFF tests were performed on days 1 and 5 at baseline and up to 
      24 h following drug intake. Subjects used the Bond-Lader visual analogue scales
      (VAS) to assess their mood and vigilance. RESULTS: In contrast to
      diphenhydramine, when compared with placebo, levocetirizine did not modify the
      CFF (primary endpoint), regardless of the dosing scheme (-1.62 Hz [-2.61, -0.64] 
      and -0.81 Hz [-1.80, 0.19], respectively, 3 h after dosing on day 1). CRT was
      decreased with both levocetirizine and placebo up to 5 h after dosing on day 1
      and up to 3 h after dosing on day 5. Body sway data were similar with
      levocetirizine and placebo but increased with diphenhydramine. LMT was similar in
      all three groups. No relevant difference between placebo and levocetirizine was
      recorded by the subjects on their assessment of alertness using the VAS, whilst
      decreased alertness was reported following diphenhydramine 50 mg. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study showed that levocetirizine does not produce any deleterious effect on 
      cognitive and psychometric functions compared with placebo in healthy male
      volunteers.

TI  - Cardiotoxicity of new antihistamines and cisapride.
PG  - 279-84
AB  - Although the new second-generation nonsedative antihistamines terfenadine and
      astemizole were launched as highly selective and specific H(1)-receptor
      antagonists, they were later found to cause prolongation of the QT-interval and
      severe cardiac arrhythmias. The prolongation of the QT-interval is caused by the 
      blockade of one or more of the cardiac potassium channels, among which the
      delayed rectifier I(Kr), encoded by the HERG-gene, appears to be the most
      significant. The potency of the prokinetic drug cisapride to block I(Kr) appears 
      to be similar to that of terfenadine (IC(50) about 50 nmol/l). These drugs cause 
      problems when overdosed, used in combination with inhibitors of their
      CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, or when given to individuals with altered drug
      kinetics (the aged) or patients with existing cardiac disease (congenitally long 
      QT). Moreover, interactions with other QT-interval prolonging drugs require
      special attention. Active hydrophilic metabolites of the second-generation
      antihistaminic compounds (ebastine-carebastine, loratadine-desloratadine,
      terfenadine-fexofenadine, astemizole-norastemizole) are new compounds with
      probably reduced risk for drug interactions and cardiac toxicity.

TI  - [Chronic idiopathic urticaria: effectiveness of fexofenadine. A double-blind,
      placebo controlled study with 21 patients].
PG  - 637-43
AB  - Chronic urticaria defined as repeated or daily eruptions of wheals within a week 
      over a period of at least 1 1/2 months is a frustrating problem not only for the 
      patient but also for the physician. Since a cause will seldom be identified,
      therapy is symptomatic. In this study the effect of fexofenadine the active
      metabolite of terfenadine on pruritus, wheal formation and subjective feedbacks
      has been investigated in 21 patients with chronic urticaria. The study was
      double-blind, placebo-controlled designed. Following a 1-week washout period all 
      study subjects received fexofenadine 180 mg OD for 3 weeks; thereafter the
      subjects were randomized for another 3 weeks in a placebo and fexofenadine arm.
      This study showed that fexofenadine had a beneficial effect on urticaria,
      particularly pruritus, and the patient-reported symptoms. Reports on side effects
      were non characteristic and not different between fexofenadine and placebo.
      Prolongation of QTc intervals or other cardiac side effects have not been
      observed. Fexofenadine 180 mg is a new antihistamine that is effective in the
      treatment of chronic urticaria and that has a profile of side effects similar to 
      placebo.

TI  - Laser-induced weal and flare reactions: clinical aspects and pharmacological
      modulation.
PG  - 863-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the adverse effects of cutaneous laser therapy, weal and flare 
      reactions immediately after treatment have received little attention, and the
      pathomechanisms are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To study clinical features and possible 
      mechanisms of laser-induced weal and flare reactions in order to identify means
      of possible therapeutic intervention. METHODS: Normal skin from the inner arm of 
      20 volunteers was treated with an argon laser, and the size of weal and flare
      reactions was measured over a 60-min period. Skin biopsies were taken from four
      volunteers before and up to 24 h after laser treatment and examined
      histologically and immunohistologically. Possible underlying mechanisms were also
      explored using various topical or systemic pharmacological agents. RESULTS:
      Wealing was noted in 19 of 20, and flare reactions in all volunteers, with peak
      values at 15 min. Skin biopsies showed central coagulation of the tissue, cleft
      formation between epidermis and dermis, normal numbers of morphologically intact 
      mast cells on toluidine blue staining close to the lesion, and only minor
      upregulation of endothelial and leucocyte adhesion molecules. In agreement with
      these findings, pretreatment with acetylsalicylic acid, the H1-blocker loratadine
      and triamcinolone cream was ineffective or resulted in a non-significant
      reduction of weal and flare reactions. In contrast, local anaesthetics as well as
      neuropeptide depletion of skin with capsaicin abolished the reactions almost
      completely. CONCLUSIONS: Transient weal and flare reactions in response to laser 
      treatment occur in almost all persons and are based primarily on a neurogenic
      rather than a histamine- or mast cell-dependent mechanism.

TI  - Grapefruit juice reduces the oral bioavailability of fexofenadine but not
      desloratadine.
PG  - 311-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Certain foods, such as grapefruit juice, are known to substantially
      alter the bioavailability of some drugs. These effects may be mediated by
      interactions with enzyme systems, such as cytochrome P450, or with active
      transporter systems, such as P-glycoprotein and organic anion transporting
      polypeptides. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of consumption of grapefruit juice 
      on the oral bioavailability of two nonsedating antihistamines, fexofenadine and
      desloratadine. DESIGN: Non-blinded, randomised, single-dose, four-way crossover
      study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four healthy adult volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Single 
      oral doses of desloratadine 5mg and fexofenadine 60mg taken without and with
      grapefruit juice (pretreatment with 240ml of double-strength juice three times
      daily for 2 days prior to administration of study drug, plus the same amount
      simultaneously with, and 2 hours after, the drug dose). Each treatment was
      separated by at least 10 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Log-transformed
      pharmacokinetic parameters [peak plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the
      curve (AUC)], time to maximum concentration, elimination half-life and
      electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters. RESULTS: Comparing the ratio of the
      pharmacokinetic parameter means (C(max) and AUC) with and without grapefruit
      juice (expressed as a percentage), the rate (C(max)) and extent (AUC) of
      absorption of fexofenadine were reduced by 30% by consumption of grapefruit
      juice. In contrast, the bioavailability of desloratadine was unaffected by
      grapefruit juice. No clinically significant changes in ECG parameters were
      observed following coadministration of grapefruit juice with desloratadine or
      fexofenadine compared with either antihistamine given alone. CONCLUSION: The
      bioavailability of drugs that do not undergo significant intestinal or hepatic
      metabolism, such as fexofenadine, may be altered when administered with agents
      that influence drug transport mechanisms.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of emedastine 0.05%
      ophthalmic solution with loratadine 10 mg and their combination in the human
      conjunctival allergen challenge model.
PG  - 445-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: When selecting treatment for allergic conjunctivitis, a primary
      concern is whether to choose local or systemic therapy. OBJECTIVE: This study
      compared the efficacy of topical emedastine 0.05% ophthalmic solution with that
      of oral loratadine 10 mg and their combination in the conjunctival allergen
      challenge model of allergic conjunctivitis. METHODS: This was a single-center,
      randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. At visit 1, 
      eligible subjects underwent conjunctival allergen challenge to identify the dose 
      required to elicit a positive allergic reaction. After 7 days, subjects returned 
      for visit 2, at which the allergen dose was confirmed. At visit 3, which took
      place 2 weeks later, subjects were randomized to receive either emedastine plus
      placebo capsules, loratadine plus placebo eyedrops, or both emedastine and
      loratadine. One hour after receiving study drug, subjects were challenged with
      allergen in both eyes. Allergic signs and symptoms were graded using standardized
      5-point scales. The primary efficacy variables were itching and conjunctival
      hyperemia. Secondary efficacy variables were ciliary and episcleral hyperemia,
      chemosis, lid swelling, and tearing. Itching was graded subjectively at 3, 5, and
      10 minutes after challenge. All other variables were assessed at 5, 10, and 20
      minutes after challenge. RESULTS: Eighty subjects (mean age, 43.68 years) were
      randomized to receive study treatment. Forty subjects (20 men, 20 women) received
      emedastine plus placebo capsules, 20 (7 men, 13 women) received loratadine plus
      placebo eyedrops, and 20 (12 men, 8 women) received both active treatments. In
      the between-group efficacy comparison at visit 3, the difference in itching and
      hyperemia scores between emedastine and loratadine was statistically significant 
      at all time points (all, P < 0.05). Efficacy scores for the combination of
      emedastine and loratadine were significantly better than those for loratadine
      alone at 2 of 3 time points for itching and all time points for hyperemia (P <
      0.05). The combination was significantly better than emedastine alone at I of 3
      time points for itching and 6 of 9 time points for hyperemia (P < 0.05).
      CONCLUSION: In this study, emedastine was more efficacious than loratadine for
      reducing the itching and redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis in the
      human conjunctival allergen challenge model.

TI  - Effects of emedastine and cetirizine, alone and with alcohol, on actual driving
      of males and females.
PG  - 57-64
AB  - Emedastine is registered in its country of origin (Japan) as an antihistamine for
      the indication of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Further research on the drug's
      sedating properties was needed to secure its registration elsewhere. The present 
      study was designed to compare the effects of emedastine 2 mg and 4 mg twice daily
      after single and repeated doses, on actual driving performance versus those of
      cetirizine 10 mg once daily and placebo; and to determine how repeated doses of
      each drug interact with alcohol to affect driving. Each treatment was
      administered for 5 days to 19 healthy volunteers (nine men and ten women, aged
      21-45 years) according to a four-period double-blind cross-over design. Driving
      performance was measured in a standardized test between 3 and 4 h after
      administration of the morning dose on days 1, 4 and 5. Alcohol, sufficient for
      achieving a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05 g/dl was given before driving on 
      day 5 of each period. Both emedastine doses similarly and significantly impaired 
      driving in every test. The effects of cetirizine were less. They were significant
      over days 1, 4 and 5 combined, although not separately. Women were more impaired 
      by both drugs. Alcohol increased driving impairment similarly in every condition.
      Subjects were only able to discriminate the sedating and impairing effects of the
      first dose of emedastine 4 mg from placebo. Emedastine, in oral doses of 2 mg and
      4 mg twice daily, is sedating and impairs driving. The drug could therefore
      constitute a traffic hazard and its users should be warned accordingly.

TI  - Montelukast: a review of its therapeutic potential in asthma in children 2 to 14 
      years of age.
PG  - 123-39
AB  - Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist which is used as a
      preventive treatment for persistent asthma in patients > or =2 years of age. In
      children aged 6 to 14 years montelukast (5 mg/day) treatment resulted in a
      significant increase in FEV(1) (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, primary
      clinical outcome) during an 8-week randomized, double-blind trial. Moreover,
      significant improvements were observed for a range of secondary endpoints
      assessing symptoms, exacerbation rates, beta-agonist usage and quality of life.
      Concomitant administration of montelukast (5 mg/day) and inhaled budesonide (200 
      microg twice daily) resulted in a trend towards an increase in FEV(1) (p = 0.06, 
      primary endpoint) and a statistically significant reduction in both as-needed
      beta(2)-agonist usage and the percentage of days with asthma exacerbations
      compared with budesonide plus placebo. No significant differences were observed
      in asthma-related quality of life between the two groups. During clinical trials 
      both improvements in lung function and reductions in as-needed beta(2)-agonist
      usage were generally observed within 1 day after initiation of therapy in
      children 2 to 14 years of age with persistent asthma. Data from a randomized,
      nonblind trial in 6- to 11-year-old children and a 6-month extension to this
      trial suggest that both compliance to therapy and patient satisfaction are
      greater for montelukast than for either inhaled sodium cromoglycate or inhaled
      beclomethasone. In addition, patients and parents preferred oral montelukast over
      sodium cromoglycate. In 2- to 5-year-old children with persistent asthma,
      montelukast (4 mg/day) treatment resulted in significant improvements in a range 
      of outcomes, such as as-needed beta(2)-agonist usage, symptom scores and
      percentage of days with asthma symptoms, as assessed during a randomized,
      double-blind trial primarily designed to assess tolerability. Data from small
      randomized, double-blind trials suggest that montelukast reduces exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction in 6- to 14-year-old children. Montelukast is generally well 
      tolerated. The frequency of adverse events in montelukast-treated children of all
      ages was comparable to that in patients receiving placebo. CONCLUSION: Oral
      montelukast has shown efficacy as a preventive treatment for asthma during
      clinical trials in children aged 2 to 14 years. The drug offers benefits over
      more standard therapies such as inhaled sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil in
      terms of compliance and convenience. In addition, the drug offers significant
      benefits when added to inhaled corticosteroids (according to secondary
      endpoints). Montelukast offers an effective, well tolerated and convenient
      treatment option for children with asthma.

TI  - Comparative activity of cetirizine and mizolastine on histamine-induced skin
      wheal and flare responses at 24 h.
PG  - 250-4
AB  - AIMS: The aim of our study was to compare the activity of cetirizine 10 mg with
      that of mizolastine 10 mg vs placebo at 24 h after intake in healthy volunteers. 
      METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, three-way
      cross-over study with a wash-out period of 7 +/- 2 days between each period. The 
      study included 36 healthy volunteers (18--50 years, mean age = 32 years; 9
      males). The objective measurement was the cutaneous reactivity to increasing
      concentrations of histamine (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 mg ml(-1)) administered by
      prick tests. The reactivity was evaluated by the wheal and flare areas (mm2). The
      AUC (area under curves) values of the wheal and flare areas as a function of the 
      log2 transformed histamine concentration were calculated for each subject and
      treatment, and compared. RESULTS: A highly significant treatment effect was
      evidenced both for wheal and flare responses (P = 0.0001). This indicates the
      good activity of both cetirizine 10 mg and mizolastine 10 mg in inhibiting skin
      wheal and flare reactions to histamine. In addition, the mean AUC values
      significantly differed between cetirizine and mizolastine (64.8 and 117.8 log2
      (mg ml(-1)) x mm2 for wheal, and 939.4 and 2340.8 for flare, respectively; P =
      0.0001), with a superior activity of cetirizine than mizolastine at 24 h after
      intake both on wheal and flare responses. The tolerance of cetirizine and
      mizolastine was good. The severity of the adverse events was never more than
      'moderate', 'fatigue' being the most frequent reported symptom [cetirizine (6
      subjects), placebo (3), mizolastine (5)], followed by 'somnolence' [cetirizine
      (0), placebo (1), mizolastine (3)]. There was no serious adverse event.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that cetirizine (10 mg) suppresses skin reactivity 
      to histamine more effectively than mizolastine (10 mg) 24 h after intake in
      healthy volunteers.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of levocetirizine in seasonal allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 305-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pharmacodynamic studies have demonstrated that levocetirizine is the
      active enantiomer of cetirizine. This first therapeutic trial of levocetirizine
      aimed at determining the dosage with the best benefit/risk ratio in patients with
      seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). METHODS: Patients with seasonal allergic
      rhinitis were randomised in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group
      multicentre study 2.5, 5, 10 mg levocetirizine or placebo once daily during 2
      weeks. Patients filled in a diary evaluation card every evening before taking
      study medication using the classical (0-3) scale for assessment of severity of
      sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal pruritus and ocular pruritus over
      the preceding 24 hours. The Total Four-Symptom Score (T4SS) was calculated by
      adding the individual symptom scores, excluding nasal congestion. RESULTS: 470
      patients were included and constituted the intent-to-treat population. All 3
      doses of levocetirizine were significantly superior to placebo in reducing the
      mean T4SS over the 2 weeks (all P (0.001). Additionally, individual symptom
      severity scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and itchy eyes were also
      significantly decreased for all doses of levocetirizine. Levocetirizine was
      significantly superior to placebo in reducing symptom severity with an important 
      global treatment effect (P = 0.0001), except for nasal congestion. Furthermore,
      there was simple linear relationship between levocetirizine dosages and reduction
      of T4SS (P = 0.001). All doses were well tolerated, somnolence was higher with 10
      mg (10.2%) than 5 mg (1.7%) and other adverse events were more frequent with the 
      highest dose. CONCLUSION: Levocetirizine 5 mg once daily has an optimal
      benefit/risk ratio in the treatment of SAR.

PG  - 329-31
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether over the counter cough medicines are effective
      for acute cough in adults. DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled
      trials. DATA SOURCES: Search of the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group
      specialised register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, and
      the UK Department of Health National Research Register in all languages. Included
      studies: All randomised controlled trials that compared oral over the counter
      cough preparations with placebo in adults with acute cough due to upper
      respiratory tract infection in ambulatory settings and that had cough symptoms as
      an outcome. RESULTS: 15 trials involving 2166 participants met all the inclusion 
      criteria. Antihistamines seemed to be no better than placebo. There was
      conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of antitussives, expectorants,
      antihistamine-decongestant combinations, and other drug combinations compared
      with placebo. CONCLUSION: Over the counter cough medicines for acute cough cannot
      be recommended because there is no good evidence for their effectiveness. Even
      when trials had significant results, the effect sizes were small and of doubtful 
      clinical relevance. Because of the small number of trials in each category, the
      results have to be interpreted cautiously.

TI  - Effects of the selective H1 and H2 histamine receptor antagonists loratadine and 
      ranitidine on autonomic control of the heart.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: H1 and H2 histamine receptor subtypes are present throughout the
      heart and may be involved in disturbances of cardiac rhythm that occur during
      anaphylaxis. Although H1 and H2 receptor antagonists are used in the treatment of
      anaphylaxis, there have been reports implicating these drugs in the genesis of
      dysrhythmias. This study was designed to investigate the effects of the selective
      H1 and H2 receptor antagonists loratadine and ranitidine on physiologic autonomic
      control of the healthy cardiovascular system. METHODS: Using a double-blind,
      crossover design, 14 healthy volunteers completed the protocol and were
      randomized to receive one dose of loratadine (20 mg), ranitidine (300 mg), or
      placebo on each of three separate testing sessions. Continuous electrocardiogram 
      and BP recordings were obtained before and 3 h after administration of study
      drug. Effects on cardiac autonomic control were quantified using power spectral
      analysis of heart rate variability and calculation of spontaneous baroreflex
      sensitivity. RESULTS: Neither placebo nor loratadine significantly altered
      indices of autonomic cardiovascular control. Conversely, H2 antagonism with
      ranitidine resulted in a 23.3% decrease in baroreflex sensitivity (P < 0.05) and 
      a corresponding 25.0% decrease in the ratio of high frequency to total power of
      heart rate variability, both indices of parasympathetic modulation (P < 0.01).
      Furthermore, ranitidine evoked a concomitant 103.8% increase in the ratio of low 
      to high frequency power of heart rate variability, an index of sympathetic
      control (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: H1 receptor antagonism with loratadine does not 
      influence physiologic cardiovascular control in young healthy subjects. However, 
      the altered cardiac sympathovagal balance after oral administration of the H2
      receptor antagonist ranitidine indicates a shift toward sympathetic predominance 
      in heart rate control. The authors postulate that this could have implications
      regarding susceptibility to arrhythmias in conditions of heightened sympathetic
      stimulation.

TI  - The effect of loratadine in exercise-induced asthma.
PG  - 38-9
AB  - AIMS: To assess the effect of loratadine in exercise induced asthma. METHODS:
      Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study of 10 mg oral loratadine, once
      daily for three days in 11 children. At the end of the treatment period FEV(1)
      was measured, and patients were exercised on a treadmill. FEV(1) measurements
      were repeated at intervals after exercise. RESULTS: Loratadine significantly
      reduced the decrease in FEV(1) after exercise at two, five, 10, 15, and 30
      minutes, compared with placebo (p < 0.05). However, the mean decrease in FEV(1)
      at five minutes was more than 15% of baseline in the loratadine group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Loratadine reduces, but does not prevent, exercise induced asthma in
      children.

TI  - [H1 antihistaminics: can we precisely define the characteristics of the ideal
      molecule?].
PG  - 623-6
AB  - The experience of the past twenty years in the field of H1 antihistamines prompts
      us to consider that these drugs are more dissimilar than has previously been
      reported in the scientific literature. In fact, the H1 antihistamines that are
      used in man seem to be effective, even if there are some differences in clinical 
      efficacy. Nevertheless they may have marked differences as far as the following
      aspects are concerned: their possible binding to various biological targets,
      their pharmacokinetics, their metabolism and their volume of distribution. All
      these differences must be taken into consideration when judging the real quality 
      of each of these drugs.

TI  - [Efficacy and safety of fexofenadine and cetirizine in the treatment of allergic 
      rhinitis].
PG  - 168-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis affects 20 million of people in United States and a
      higher figure all around the world. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of fexofenadine compared with certirizine in the treatment of allergic
      rhinitis. MATERIAL AND METHOD: It was carried out a prospective, double blind,
      comparative, randomized and multicentric study in patients with allergic
      rhinitis, with ages between 12 and 65 years. In the first phase, placebo was
      administered during three days to all the patients; and then, they were randomly 
      allocated to receive fexofenadine 120 mg or cetirizine 10 mg in one dose a day
      during 14 days. Laboratory and cabinet tests at the beginning and at the end were
      performed to value security, as well as a global evaluation of the researcher to 
      estimate effectiveness. RESULTS: 176 patients were included, 63.6% were women,
      average age was 27 years (+/- 12), 47.7% received fexofenadine and 52.2%,
      cetirizine. There was not significant difference in parameters of effectiveness
      nor of security in the studied group. CONCLUSION: The results of the present
      study confirm the efficacy and safety of the antihistaminic fexofenadine in the
      treatment of allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of butterbur and cetirizine for treating seasonal
      allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 144-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of butterbur (Petasites
      hybridus) with cetirizine in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay
      fever). DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, parallel group comparison. SETTING:
      Four outpatient general medicine and allergy clinics in Switzerland and Germany. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 131 patients were screened for seasonal allergic rhinitis and 125
      patients were randomised (butterbur 61; cetirizine 64). INTERVENTIONS: Butterbur 
      (carbon dioxide extract tablets, ZE 339) one tablet, four times daily, or
      cetirizine, one tablet in the evening, both given for two consecutive weeks. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Scores on SF-36 questionnaire and clinical global impression
      scale. RESULTS: Improvement in SF-36 score was similar in the two treatment
      groups for all items tested hierarchically. Butterbur and cetirizine were also
      similarly effective with regard to global improvement scores on the clinical
      global impression scale (median score 3 in both groups). Both treatments were
      well tolerated. In the cetirizine group, two thirds (8/12) of reported adverse
      events were associated with sedative effects (drowsiness and fatigue) despite the
      drug being considered a non-sedating antihistamine. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of
      butterbur are similar to those of cetirizine in patients with seasonal allergic
      rhinitis when evaluated blindly by patients and doctors. Butterbur should be
      considered for treating seasonal allergic rhinitis when the sedative effects of
      antihistamines need to be avoided.

TI  - Cetirizine/pseudoephedrine.
PG  - 2231-40; discussion 2241-2
AB  - Cetirizine is the carboxylated metabolite of hydroxyzine, and has high specific
      affinity for histamine H(1) receptors. Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic drug 
      that acts directly on alpha-adrenergic receptors. black triangle
      Cetirizine/pseudoephedrine 5/120 mg twice daily was significantly more effective 
      than intranasal budesonide 100 microg or placebo at improving nasal obstruction, 
      nasal patency and reducing the volume of nasal secretion, and was significantly
      more effective than intranasal xylometazoline 0.1% with respect to nasal
      secretion, during house dust mite faeces challenge in three randomised, cross-
      over studies among volunteers with seasonal or perennial rhinitis. The onset of
      action of cetirizine/pseudoephedrine was reported to be approximately 30 minutes.
      black triangle The bioavailability of cetirizine and pseudoephedrine is similar
      after administration of cetirizine/pseudoephedrine 5/120 mg bilayer tablets or
      coadministration of cetirizine 5 mg tablets plus pseudoephedrine
      sustained-release (SR) 120 mg caplets. black triangle Cetirizine 5mg plus
      pseudoephedrine SR 120 mg twice daily for 2 to 3 weeks was significantly more
      effective than each drug given alone at reducing mean total symptom scores for
      seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis in two randomised, double-blind,
      multicentre trials. In both studies, the mean proportion of days during which the
      five measured symptoms (nasal obstruction, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal pruritus 
      and ocular pruritus) were absent or mild was significantly greater in recipients 
      of the cetirizine plus pseudoephedrine SR. black triangle In one study,
      cetirizine 5 mg plus pseudoephedrine SR 120 mg was significantly more effective
      at reducing nasal obstruction than either drug alone. black triangle Cetirizine
      5mg plus pseudoephedrine SR 120 mg twice daily for 2 to 3 weeks was well
      tolerated in patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis. The most
      common adverse events were dry mouth, insomnia, headache, somnolence, asthenia
      and nervousness.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of an oral formulation of cetirizine and prolonged-release
      pseudoephedrine versus xylometazoline nasal spray in nasal congestion.
PG  - 904-10
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the decongestant properties and tolerability
      of the sympathomimetic xylometazoline hydrochloride 0.1% (CAS 1218-35-5, XMZ) and
      an oral formulation of cetirizine hydrochloride 5 mg and pseudoephedrine
      hydrochloride 120 mg (CAS 83881-51-0 and 90-82-4, CTZ/PSE; Cirrus). Thirty-six
      asymptomatic patients suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis from house dust 
      mite were randomized to this open two-period crossover study. Patients received
      the study medications for four days each. In each period, treatments were taken
      twice a day. On day 1 in each period, immediately after the first dose of
      medication, patients were challenged with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extract 
      1 in the Vienna Challenge Chamber for 5 h. Primary efficacy parameters were nasal
      congestion evaluated by digital analysis of nasal cavity photographs and nasal
      airflow. Furthermore amounts of nasal secretions, nasal and ocular symptoms were 
      recorded. In addition, 5 independent Ear-Nose-Throat specialists also assessed
      nasal cavity photographs. Statistical analyses were conducted at the 5% level of 
      significance. Digital analysis of the nasal cavity photographs as well as nasal
      airflow measurements did not differentiate XMZ from CTZ/PSE. Ratings of the
      photographs of the nasal cavity emphasized the rapid onset of XMZ. No clinically 
      relevant adverse events were recorded. This rapid onset of action but short-lived
      effect of topical xylometazoline 0.1% should be balanced against the consistent
      and prolonged effect of systemic cetirizine/pseudoephedrine combination in the
      treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis as no significant differences between
      these 2 medications were noted regarding their decongestant properties. With the 
      exception of nasal obstruction, all subjective symptoms as well as the global
      condition were significantly better under CTZ/PSE. Amounts of nasal secretions
      during these sessions were significantly lower with CTZ/PSE.

TI  - Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of [14C]levocetirizine, the R 
      enantiomer of cetirizine, in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 571-82
AB  - The main goal of the present study was to investigate the absorption and
      disposition of levocetirizine dihydrochloride, the R enantiomer of cetirizine
      dihydrochloride, following a single oral administration (5 mg) of the
      14C-labelled compound in healthy volunteers. Configurational stability was also
      investigated. Levocetirizine was rapidly and extensively absorbed: 85.4% and
      12.9% of the radioactive dose were recovered 168 h post-dose in urine and faeces,
      respectively. Levocetirizine and/or its metabolites were not, or only very
      poorly, associated with blood cells, as the blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.51 to
      0.68. The mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 26.9 1 (0.3 l/kg)
      indicating that the distribution of levocetirizine is restrictive. The protein
      binding of radiolabelled levocetirizine was 96.1% l h after administration. In
      vitro, at concentrations ranging from 0.2 microg/ml to 1 microg/ml, the protein
      binding was 94.8% to 95.0%. Levocetirizine is very poorly metabolised. The
      cumulative 48-h excretion as parent compound accounted for 85.8% of the oral
      dose, equivalent to 95% of the total radioactivity excreted at this time. At
      least 13 minor metabolites were detected in urine and represented 2.4% of the
      dose at 48 h. The metabolic pathways involved in levocetirizine metabolism are
      oxidation (hydroxylation, O-dealkylation, N-oxidation and N-dealkylation),
      glucuroconjugation, taurine conjugation and glutathione conjugation with
      formation of the mercapturic acids. There was no evidence of chiral inversion of 
      levocetirizine in humans. This result is consistent with that obtained in
      preclinical studies.

TI  - Superiority of an intranasal corticosteroid compared with an oral antihistamine
      in the as-needed treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 2581-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The daily use of either intranasal corticosteroids or histamine(1)
      (H(1)) receptor antagonists has proved to be efficacious in the treatment of
      seasonal allergic rhinitis. Most patients, however, use these medications as
      needed. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of as-needed use of H(1)
      receptor antagonists with that of intranasal corticosteroids in the treatment of 
      seasonal allergic rhinitis. METHODS: We performed a randomized, open-label,
      parallel-group study comparing the as-needed use of an H(1) receptor antagonist
      (loratadine) with that of an intranasal corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate)
      in the management of fall seasonal allergic rhinitis in the fall of 1999.
      Subjects kept a diary of their daily symptoms and were examined at enrollment
      into the study and biweekly for 4 weeks during treatment. Outcome measures were
      the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score, daily symptom diary 
      scores, and the number of eosinophils and the levels of eosinophilic cationic
      protein in nasal lavage samples. RESULTS: Patients in the fluticasone-treated
      group reported significantly better scores in the activity, sleep, practical,
      nasal, and overall domains (P<.05) of the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life
      Questionnaire. The median total symptom score in the fluticasone-treated group
      was significantly lower than that in the loratadine-treated group (4.0 vs 7.0;
      P<.01). After treatment, the number of eosinophils was significantly smaller in
      the fluticasone-treated group compared with the loratadine-treated group (P
      =.001). Eosinophilic cationic protein levels followed the same pattern, with a
      significant correlation between the levels of eosinophilic cationic protein and
      the number of eosinophils (r(s) = 0.70, P<.01). CONCLUSION: As-needed intranasal

      rhinitis.

TI  - Pruritus in polycythaemia vera: prevalence, laboratory correlates and management.
PG  - 619-21
AB  - In a retrospective cohort, 192 (48%) out of 397 patients with polycythaemia vera 
      had a documented history of pruritus. At diagnosis, the presence of pruritus was 
      significantly associated with a lower mean corpuscular volume and a higher
      leucocyte count. Among 66 patients with documentation of treatment for pruritus, 
      389 'patient visits' were reviewed, revealing a significant correlation between
      active pruritus and low mean corpuscular volume, but not platelet, leucocyte or
      basophil count. Paroxetine and hydroxyzine were rated by patients to be the most 
      effective drugs in controlling pruritus. These observations suggest a
      pathogenetic role for both iron deficiency and biogenic amines in polycythaemia
      vera-associated pruritus.

TI  - Controlled clinical study of the efficacy of loratadine in Nigerian patients with
      allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 127-32
AB  - An observer blind clinical study was carried out among 64 Nigerian patients with 
      allergic rhinitis to assess the efficacy and tolerance of loratadine a new
      generation H1 antihistamine. Patients were allotted randomly to receive treatment
      for 1 week with either loratadine + Vit. C (group A), chlorpheniramine + Vit. C
      (group B), or Vit. C alone (group C). Assessment was by subjective symptom
      scoring of three nasal symptoms namely; sneezing, rhinorrhoea and nasal blockage.
      Difference between pre treatment and post treatment mean symptom scores was used 
      as degree of improvement for statistical analysis and this formed the primary
      efficacy parameter. Adverse effects namely; anticholinergic effects,
      gastrointestinal effects and drowsiness were assessed following treatment. The
      results showed that loratadine was significantly better than Vit. C. alone (P =
      0.0002) and chlorpheniramine was also significantly better than Vit. C. alone (P 
      = 0.039). However, loratadine was significantly better than chlorpheniramine P = 
      0.046. Drowsiness was noted in 19.2% of patients on loratadine compared with
      57.1% of patients on chlorpheniramine. lt is concluded that though both
      loratadine and chlorpheniramine were effective in the relief of symptoms of
      allergic rhinitis in Nigerian patients, loratadine was significantly more
      effective with minimal sedating effect.

TI  - Desloratadine reduces nasal congestion in patients with intermittent allergic
      rhinitis.
PG  - 1077-80
AB  - Nasal congestion is among the most bothersome of the symptoms of intermittent
      allergic rhinitis (IAR). Decongestants such as pseudoephedrine are often
      accompanied by adverse effects and should be avoided by patients with
      hypertension, arrhythmia, and other medical conditions. Most of the currently
      available antihistamines are ineffective for nasal congestion. Oral
      desloratadine, a new, potent H1-receptor antagonist, was examined for its ability
      to relieve nasal congestion/stuffiness in 346 patients (172 in the desloratadine 
      group and 174 in the placebo group) with IAR. Desloratadine, administered once
      daily at a dose of 5 mg, demonstrated significant improvement in nasal
      congestion/stuffiness at all time points assessed in the study. This benefit was 
      observed as early as the first patient evaluation on day 2 and continued
      throughout the 2 weeks of the study. Desloratadine is a new treatment option for 
      patients with IAR and nasal congestion.

TI  - Fexofenadine reduces nasal congestion in perennial allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 1068-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nasal congestion is the predominant symptom in perennial allergic
      rhinitis (PAR), and it seems to be mainly related to the late-phase inflammatory 
      events. The present pilot study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect exerted 
      by fexofenadine in patients with PAR due to mite allergy. METHODS: This study was
      a parallel, double-blind, randomized, three-arm (1:1:1), placebo-controlled
      study. Thirty-one subjects with PAR were enrolled and received double-blind
      medication: fexofenadine 120 or 180 mg, or placebo, once a day for 28 days.
      RESULTS: The total symptom score was reduced by fexofenadine (both dosages) at V2
      (P=0.007), whereas placebo did not modify it. Nasal congestion decreased after 1 
      week of treatment with fexofenadine 120 (P=0.027) and 180 (P=0.01), but not with 
      placebo (P=NS). At V3, fexofenadine (both dosages) significantly reduced nasal
      congestion (P=0.011 and P=0.007, respectively), by placebo did not show any
      significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study represents the first evidence
      of the efficacy of fexofenadine in PAR, and also the control of the nasal
      congestion. We suggest performing larger trials to confirm these preliminary
      findings.

TI  - Treatment of urticaria. An evidence-based evaluation of antihistamines.
PG  - 27-32
AB  - Urticaria is a cutaneous syndrome characterized by dermal edema (wheal) and
      erythema (flare) that blanches with pressure. The lesions typically last less
      than 24 hours and are usually pruritic. In 1983, Christensen and Maibach
      summarized the theory behind the use of histamine H1 receptor antagonists
      (antihistamines) in clinical dermatology. These agents remain the mainstay of
      treatment for urticaria. This article reviews the medical literature on the
      effectiveness of antihistamines in urticarial syndromes, including acute, chronic
      idiopathic and the physical urticarias. Older antihistamines, such as
      chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine, are effective in the treatment of urticarias,
      but they also have marked sedative and anticholinergic effects. Newer nonsedating
      antihistamines (second-generation antihistamines) have been developed that have
      reduced adverse effects because they do not cross the blood-brain barrier; these 
      agents (acrivastine, cetirizine, loratadine, mizolastine, fexofenadine, ebastine,
      azelastine and epinastine) cause significantly less sedation and psychomotor
      impairment than their older counterparts. A review of the literature reveals that
      there are few studies which document the efficacy of second-generation
      antihistamines in the treatment of acute urticaria, a biologic entity that
      usually resolves within 3 weeks. We did not identify controlled studies that
      suggested superiority of any antihistamine in the treatment of acute urticaria.
      Loratadine or cetirizine, and possibly mizolastine, appear to be treatments of
      choice for chronic idiopathic urticaria. For symptomatic dermatographism, the
      combination of an antihistamine and an H2 antagonist, e.g. chlorpheniramine and
      cimetidine, appears to be effective. Very few studies have been conducted on the 
      use of antihistamines in the treatment of cold, cholinergic, and pressure
      urticaria. Antihistamines are the mainstay of urticarial therapy. This
      evidence-based review suggests that there are efficacy differences between newer,
      nonsedating antihistamines and older agents in some forms of the disorder.
      Clearly, further well-controlled clinical trials in larger numbers of patients
      are needed to clarify the role of these agents in the treatment of urticaria.

TI  - Sublingual immunotherapy in tree pollen allergy. Double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study with a biologically standardised extract of three pollens (alder, birch and
      hazel) administered by a rush schedule.
PG  - 103-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: sublingual immunotherapy has been recognised as safe and effective
      but it is still poorly documented in tree pollen allergy. Allergy to alder, birch
      and hazel is important in Northern European countries but its clinical relevance 
      is increasing in Southern Europe. METHODS: thirty patients, selected and observed
      for one pollen season, were randomised to receive placebo (15 patients) or active
      treatment (15 patients). Twenty-seven patients completed the first year and 24 of
      them were treated with active therapy during the second year of the study in
      comparison to a parallel group of ten patients treated only with drugs. Symptom
      and drug scores during each pollen season, birch-specific IgE, changes in skin
      test reactivity, changes in specific Nasal Provocation Test and the daily average
      pollen count for the relevant trees were considered for the assessment of the
      efficacy of the treatment. RESULTS: both active and placebo group showed a
      statistically significant improvement in scores in comparison to the previous
      year, under a lower allergenic pressure. The improvement was higher in the active
      group (76.04 % reduction of drugs) but not significantly different from that
      registered in the placebo group (37.05 % reduction). In the open phase of the
      study, treated patients showed significantly better scores in comparison to the
      control group. No significant changes in skin reactivity, specific IgE and Nasal 
      Provocation Test were registered. SLIT tolerance was very good. CONCLUSIONS: our 
      data show a better but not statistically significant clinical outcome for
      patients actively treated with SLIT, but the placebo effect and the year-by-year 
      variability of the environmental allergenic load in our small-size pilot study do
      not allow for a conclusive statement about the efficacy of this form of therapy.

TI  - Causality assessment of adverse effects: when is re-challenge ethically
      acceptable?
PG  - 793-9
AB  - One of the most difficult tasks in the evaluation of a medicine is whether it
      causes a particular rare and unusual (idiosyncratic) adverse effect. Such
      causality assessments are sometimes done by drug de-challenge and re-challenge.
      When the adverse effect is potentially serious, there is clearly an important
      decision to be made as to whether the re-challenge is justifiable and hence
      ethical. The recent controversy about the potential cardiotoxicity of
      fexofenadine, the fatalities associated with penicillin re-challenge and the
      fatalities associated with abacavir re-challenge highlight some of the potential 
      serious risks of drug re-challenge. The associated important ethical issues are
      discussed. In particular, there is the need to ensure respect for the patient and
      to consider the scientific and social value of the re-challenge. A framework for 
      evaluating and assessing the appropriateness of a particular drug re-challenge is
      proposed in the light of recent as well as long-standing discussions of drug
      re-challenge, patient informed consent and the ethics of human experimentation,
      in general. It is suggested that a drug re-challenge should be approached with
      the same rigour and standards of documentation as are currently required of
      clinical trials. Given the potential conflicts of interest inherent with any drug
      study, it is argued that the safeguards, as may be provided by scrutiny by an
      ethics committee, are necessary for a drug re-challenge. For the investigator
      contemplating the conduct of a drug re-challenge we would recommend the
      following: (i) a careful risk-benefit assessment as part of the decision-making
      process; (ii) careful scientific preparation, including appropriate expert
      support and emergency back-up facilities, if re-challenge is deemed necessary;
      (iii) the writing of a detailed protocol for independent approval and for
      safeguarding all concerned; and (iv) meticulous record keeping.

TI  - Treatment of acute cryptococcal disease.
PG  - 1259-68
AB  - Successful treatment outcome for cryptococcal disease has been available since
      the introduction of the polyene antifungal, amphotericin B. Over the past 15-20
      years, treatment of acute cryptococcal disease has dramatically improved. Several
      therapeutic strategies have been introduced which improve overall outcome of
      therapy and help decrease the duration of treatment. Not surprisingly, most data 
      now exists on the treatment of AIDS-associated cryptococcal disease, especially
      cryptococcal meningitis. Currently, amphotericin B with or without flucytosine is
      regarded as the best initial therapy for patients with meningitis or more severe 
      illness, although, the azoles and other formulations of amphotericin B can
      considered in other situations. The choice of treatment for cryptococcal disease 
      depends on both the anatomic sites of involvement and the host's immune status,
      all of which will be addressed in this article.

PG  - 1177-86
AB  - Triamcinolone is a commonly used synthetic corticosteroid that has recently been 
      tested in a large clinical trial for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
      shown to have some benefits. To our knowledge, there are no reviews of the
      pharmacotherapy of triamcinolone. This review has a brief overview of the
      pharmacology of triamcinolone, followed by a discussion of the clinical trials
      with triamcinolone. Triamcinolone is used in the treatment of respiratory
      inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis and a variety of other inflammatory
      conditions.

TI  - Intranasal corticosteroids for allergic rhinitis: superior relief?
PG  - 1563-79
AB  - Whether first-line pharmacological treatment of allergic rhinitis should be
      antihistamines or intranasal corticosteroids has been discussed for several
      years. First-generation antihistamines are rarely used in the treatment of
      allergic rhinitis, mainly because of sedative and anticholinergic adverse
      effects. On the basis of clinical evidence of efficacy, no second-generation
      antihistamine seems preferable to another. Similarly, comparisons of topical and 
      oral antihistamines have been unable to demonstrate superior efficacy for one
      method of administration over the other. Current data documents no striking
      differences in efficacy and safety parameters between intranasal corticosteroids.
      When the efficacy of antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids are compared
      in patients with allergic rhinitis, present data favours intranasal
      corticosteroids. Interestingly, data do not show antihistamines as superior for
      the treatment of conjunctivitis. Safety data from comparative studies in patients
      with allergic rhinitis do not indicate differences between antihistamines and
      intranasal corticosteroids. Combining antihistamines and intranasal
      corticosteroids in the treatment of allergic rhinitis does not provide any
      additional effect to intranasal corticosteroids alone. On the basis of current
      data, intranasal corticosteroids seem to offer superior relief in allergic
      rhinitis than antihistamines.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of levocetirizine and loratadine on histamine-induced
      wheal, flare, and itch in human skin.
PG  - 985-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: This randomized, double-blind, crossover study compared the effects
      of the R-enantiomer of cetirizine, levocetirizine, with those of loratadine on
      the wheal, flare, and itch response to histamine in human skin. METHODS:
      Levocetirizine (5 mg), loratadine (10 mg), or placebo was taken orally 4 h before
      the intradermal injection of histamine (20 microl, 100 microM) or the control
      vehicle into the forearm skin of healthy volunteers. Flare areas were assessed by
      scanning laser Doppler imaging before and at 30-s intervals for a period of 9
      min. Wheal areas were measured by planimetry at 10 min. Itch was scored every 30 
      s with a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: After placebo administration, the mean
      peak flare area was 23.01+/-1.94 cm(2), the wheal area 248+/-27 mm(2), and the
      cumulative itch score 28.8+/-4.6% (mean+/-SEM). Levocetirizine reduced the flare,
      wheal, and itch by 60%, 68%, and 91%, respectively (all P<0.001, Student's t-test
      for paired data). The effects of loratadine were variable and not statistically
      significant. CONCLUSION: Levocetirizine (5 mg) is a potent inhibitor of the
      effects of histamine in human skin with an efficacy that exceeded that of
      loratadine (10 mg) when single doses of the drugs were administered 4 h before
      the test.

TI  - Absorption and disposition of levocetirizine, the eutomer of cetirizine,
      administered alone or as cetirizine to healthy volunteers.
PG  - 269-77
AB  - The primary objective of the present study was to compare the absorption and
      disposition of levocetirizine, the eutomer of cetirizine, when administered alone
      (10 mg) or in presence of the distomer. An additional objective was also to
      investigate the configurational stability of levocetirizine in vivo in humans.
      The study was performed in a randomized, two-way cross-over, single-dose design
      with a wash-out phase of 7 days between the two periods. A total of 12 healthy
      male and 12 healthy female volunteers were included in the study. Bioequivalence 
      can be concluded from the analysis of the pharmacokinetic parameters of
      levocetirizine when administered alone or as the racemate cetirizine. No chiral
      inversion occurs in humans when levocetirizine is administered, i.e. there is no 
      formation of the distomer. When comparing the pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
      levocetirizine and the distomer, the apparent volume of distribution of the
      eutomer is significantly smaller than that of the distomer (0.41 and 0.60 L/kg,
      respectively). For an H1-antagonist a small distribution volume can be considered
      as a positive aspect, both in terms of efficacy and safety. Moreover the
      non-renal clearance of levocetirizine is also significantly lower than that of
      the distomer (9.70 and 28.70 mL/min, respectively), which constitutes an
      additional positive aspect particularly as far as metabolism-based drug
      interactions are concerned. The information collected in the present study on the
      pharmacokinetics of levocetirizine and the distomer provide additional reasons
      for eliminating the distomer and developing levocetirizine as an improvement on
      cetirizine.

TI  - Evaluation of the safety of fexofenadine from experience gained in general
      practice use in England in 1997.
PG  - 313-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fexofenadine is the active metabolite of the non-sedating
      anti-histamine terfenadine. Pre-licensing clinical trials in over 6000 patients
      suggested it was effective and well tolerated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the
      tolerability and safety of fexofenadine immediately after its availability on the
      UK market in March 1997. METHODS: Post-marketing non-interventional observational
      cohort study using the methodology of prescription-event monitoring. Exposure
      data derived from dispensed prescription details supplied in confidence by the
      Prescription Pricing Authority. Outcome data derived from questionnaires returned
      by general practitioners (GPs) in England between March and August 1997. RESULTS:
      Of the 35,817 questionnaires sent, 18,238 (50.9%) were returned, of which 16,638 
      contained useful data. These included 40% male (mean age 36+/-19 years) and 59%
      female (mean age 39+/-19 years). Most common indications were allergic rhinitis
      (55%), not specified (28%), urticaria, pruritus or rash (10%) and other
      indications (7%). There were 40 reports of adverse drug reactions in 27 patients.
      Less than 2% of patients stopped the drug because of side effects. Events
      reported after exposure to fexofenadine were uncommon and already reported in
      clinical trials. There were eight reports of possible cardiac side effects
      (palpitations, three; chest pain, three; arrhythmia, one; and chest tightness,
      one). None was felt to be serious. There were no drug interactions reported. None
      of the 30 deaths was related to fexofenadine. None of the three adverse outcomes 
      from the 47 pregnancies reported was related to fexofenadine. CONCLUSION: Within 
      the limitations for an observational cohort study, fexofenadine was found to be
      well tolerated and safe in 16,638 users in general practice in England.

TI  - Phase I dose-finding and pharmacokinetic study of docetaxel and vinorelbine as
      first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 909-18
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Anthracycline-containing regimens are widely used in
      advanced breast cancer. However, there is a need for new, non-anthracycline
      regimens that are active in patients for whom anthracyclines are contraindicated.
      The aim of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and recommended doses of docetaxel and
      vinorelbine as first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
      The pharmacokinetics of both drugs was also evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Thirty-four women with first-line metastatic breast cancer were treated with
      docetaxel, 60-100 mg/m2 (day 1), and vinorelbine, 20-22.5 mg/m2 (days 1 and 5),
      repeated every three weeks and administered on an outpatient basis. RESULTS: Two 
      MTDs were determined: MTD1 was defined at the dose level using docetaxel 75
      mg/m2, and vinorelbine 22.5 mg/m2 DLT being a grade 3 stomatitis that was more
      related to the dose of vinorelbine than that of docetaxel. Therefore, the study
      continued with a fixed dose of vinorelbine, 20 mg/m2, and docetaxel 85-100 mg/m2.
      MTD2 was defined at the dose level combining docetaxel, 100 mg/m2, and
      vinorelbine, 20 mg/m2; DLTs were grade 3 stomatitis and severe asthenia. Fluid
      retention was observed in 41% of patients but was never severe or a reason for
      patient discontinuation. In comparison with historical experience, Daflon 500 did
      not seem to increase the efficacy of the three-day corticosteroid premedication
      by further reducing the incidence or severity of fluid retention. No significant 
      neurotoxicity was observed and no patient discontinued the study due to this site
      effect. Activity was observed at all dose levels and at all metastatic sites,
      with an overall response rate of 71% (95% CI: 52.0%-85.8%). The median time to
      progression was 31.4 weeks (95% CI: 12-48 weeks) and median survival was 15.6
      months (95% CI: 2.6-26.6 months). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and
      vinorelbine were not modified between day 1 and day 3 when the two drugs were
      combined with the day 1 administration schedule used in this study. CONCLUSION:
      The recommended doses for phase II studies are docetaxel, 75 mg/m2 (day 1), plus 
      vinorelbine, 20 mg/m2 (days 1 and 5), repeated every three weeks. At these doses,
      the combination was found to be active and well tolerated.

TI  - Cetirizine reduces the number of tryptase-positive mast cells in psoriatic
      patients: a double-blind controlled study.
PG  - 97-103
AB  - Psoriatic plaque contains an increased number of mast cells that are thought to
      play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of the disease through
      the release of mediators such as histamine, proteoglycans, proteinases and
      cytokines. To verify the possible participation of these cells in the chronic
      inflammatory cutaneous response in psoriasis, we performed a double-blind
      controlled study to investigate the presence and activation of tryptase-positive 
      mast cells in the lesional skin of 19 patients affected by active psoriasis
      vulgaris minima compared with five healthy, age-matched subjects. Psoriatic
      patients were randomized into two groups (A and B). The first group was treated
      with cetirizine (10 mg/three times a day for 15 days) and the second one was
      treated with placebo. Both groups underwent clinical staging [psoriasis area and 
      severity index (PASI) score] and immunohistochemical evaluation [alkaline
      phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) procedure] before and after
      treatment. In group A, the PASI score ranged from 3.8 (SE +/- 1.00) to 1.8 (SE
      +/- 0.68) and in group B, from 5.0 (SE +/- 0.98) to 3.4 (SE +/- 0.47). The mean
      number of tryptase-positive mast cells for field, mainly distributed in the
      perivascular and periadnexal sites, ranged from 40.8 (SE +/- 7.15) to 21.6 (SE
      +/- 3.04) in group A and from 25.1 (SE +/- 3.78) to 26.3 (SE +/- 3.59) in group B
      (ANOVA test f = 6.95; gl = 1.16; p = 0.02). In our psoriatic patients, cetirizine
      significantly reduced the expression of tryptase-positive mast cells and produced
      a clinical improvement in erythema, suggesting a multilevel immunopharmacologic
      modulation of this antihistamine in psoriasis.

TI  - Burn wound itch control using H1 and H2 antagonists.
PG  - 263-8
AB  - This study investigated the use of a combination of H1 and H2 antagonists and
      topical medications to control burn wound itch. Graeco-Latin square assignment
      provided an oral combination of 1) cetirizine and cimetidine or 2)
      diphenhydramine and placebo in four divided doses. The study protocol lasted 16
      days divided into 4-day intervals, scoring itch before the initial dose of
      medication and at 1-hour, 6-hour, and 12-hour intervals after the first
      medication. A significant difference between mean itch scores across the four
      times was observed (Wilks' Lambda F = 26.52, df = 3, P <.0005). A three-way
      nested repeated measures interaction effect (Wilks' Lambda F = 9.85, df = 9, P
      <.0005) was observed representing a significantly different pattern on days 1 to 
      4 of the study compared with the remaining days. Controlling for the effect of
      topical medications, the cetirizine/cimetidine combination demonstrated a
      dramatic improvement at 1 and 6 hours, and a moderate improvement at 12 hours
      after initial medication for the day when compared with the
      diphenhydramine/placebo combination.

TI  - Stanozolol in chronic urticaria: a double blind, placebo controlled trial.
PG  - 299-302
AB  - H1-type antihistamine drugs are mainstays in the management of chronic urticaria.
      For patients with refractory, chronic, idiopathic urticaria who have failed to
      benefit from conventional therapy, other safe therapeutic modalities are
      required. To evaluate the role of stanozolol as an adjunctive therapeutic agent
      with H1-antihistamine in refractory chronic idiopathic urticaria, we conducted
      this study. Fifty-eight patients with chronic refractory urticaria were enrolled 
      in this trial and were randomly assigned to two groups (A and B). Patients in
      group A received 2 mg stanozolol twice daily along with cetrizine 10 mg daily.
      Patients in group B received cetrizine 10 mg daily and placebo tablets twice
      daily. The improvement was monitored by estimation of severity score. Of the 58
      patients, 26 in group A and 24 in group B could be evaluated. At the end of 12
      weeks, 17 patients in group A showed marked to complete resolution as compared to
      7 patients in group B (chi-square p<0.01). The intention to treat analysis p
      value was a found to be <0.007. There was a highly significant decrease in mean
      severity score at 12 weeks (p<0.001) in group A patients. The present study
      demonstrated that stanozolol is an effective and safe adjuvant therapy for
      treatment of chronic refractory urticaria.

TI  - Controlled study of preseasonal immunotherapy with grass pollen extract in
      tablets: effect on bronchial hyperreactivity.
PG  - 41-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on experimental results, the sublingual route for immunotherapy
      (IT) has been accepted as a viable alternative to the injection route, but few
      data on the effects on asthma are so far available. OBJECTIVE: In the present
      open controlled trial we evaluated whether a preseasonal IT with grass polllen in
      orosoluble tablets added to pharmacotherapy, can improve non-specific bronchial
      hyperreactivity. The clinical efficacy was evaluated as well. METHODS: Fifty-one 
      patients (mean age 27.4 years) suffering from rhinoconjunctivitis and/or
      mild-intermittent/mild-persistent asthma due to grass pollen were allocated to
      two groups receiving pharmacotherapy alone (n = 25) or pharmacotherapy plus IT in
      tablets (n = 26). A methacholine test was performed in asthmatic subjects out of 
      the pollen seasons at baseline and after 3 years of treatment. Symptom scores and
      drug intake were evaluated during pollen seasons by a diary card. RESULTS: A
      significant increase p = .01) in the PD20 at the methacholine test was observed
      in the IT group compared to the control group. A significant clinical improvement
      both for rhinitis (p = .001) and asthma (p = .001) was observed in the IT group, 
      and this improvement was paralleled by a clear-cut reduction of drug intake (p = 
      .001). An improvement of rhinitis symptoms without modification of drug intake
      was seen in the control group (p = .01) The treatment was well tolerated and no
      relevant side effect was reported during the 3 years. CONCLUSION: The
      investigated local IT reduced the nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity.
      Furthermore, it was clinically effective and safe.

PG  - 34-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of combined azelastine nasal spray and eye drops treatment
      in patients with severe rhinoconjunctivitis. METHODS: Phase III, multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind study of patients with a history of grass pollen
      allergy, confirmed by skin testing/specific IgE, total symptom scores > or =6
      (ocular) or > or =8 (nasal). Intent-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: 99 patients
      (azelastine = 53, placebo = 46) enrolled homogeneously from May to September 1997
      in 7 venues in France. The efficacy of azelastine was significantly higher
      compared to placebo (49% vs. 28%, p = 0.04), considering response as a decrease
      of the total sum of ocular and nasal scores by at least 50% and no use of
      cetirizine by day 7. The decrease of total ocular and nasal scores by at least
      50% at day 7, with cetirizine rescue <3 tablets was higher, but not
      significantly, in azelastine patients (43% vs. 30%). Cetirizine rescue was more
      frequent, from day 0 to 7, in the placebo patients (4.9 +/- 5.0 vs. 2.7 +/- 4.1, 
      p = 0.02). Global efficacy was rated higher for azelastine by investigators (26% 
      vs. 10%, p = 0.05) and patients (28% vs. 7%, p = 0.01). Adverse events were
      burning sensation, "red eyes," nasal irritation, bitter taste. No serious adverse
      events were reported. Tolerance of azelastine was "very good/good"/"satisfactory"
      in the majority (62%/82% assessed by investigators, or 55%/79% by patients,
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Combining azelastine eye drops and nasal spray is a
      safe and effective treatment of severe seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis.

TI  - The comparison of the efficacy of fluticasone propionate with cetirizine in
      perennial allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is an IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction of the
      nasal mucosa characterised by nasal discharge, obstruction, and pruritus.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 43 patients with perenneal allergic rhinitis
      were enrolled in order to compare the efficacy of Fluticasone Propionate (FP), a 
      corticosteroid nasal spray, with Cetirizine, a systemic oral antihistaminic
      preparation, which is supposed to have nonsteroidal antiinflammatory activity.
      Cetirizine (10 mg daily as a single dose) was administered to 22 patient for 45
      days. On the other hand, FP (400 micrograms/day) was administered into each
      nostril twice a day in the remaining 21 patients for 45 days. Skin test was
      obtained from each patient before therapy. Total eosinophil count, eosinophil
      count in nasal smear, electrorhinomanometric investigation, PGE2 and ratio of
      LTC4 to LTD4 both in the serum and in the nasal secretions were determined before
      and after therapy. In addition, percentage of eosinophils, and mast cells count
      in the biopsy specimens taken from anterior edge of middle choncha were evaluated
      before and after therapy, and than the results were graded for each patients.
      RESULTS: When we compared the eosinophil count in nasal smear, eosinophil
      percentage and total eosinophil parameters between two groups, it was shown that 
      FP was more effective than Cetirizine. On the other hand, when we compared the
      ratio of LTC4 to LTD4 in serum and nasal smear, level of PGE2 and mast cell and
      nasal airway resistance measured by ERM, there were non statistical difference
      between two groups. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that FP and Cetirizine may 
      be used alternatively in case of an adverse reaction to any of them.

TI  - Desloratadine.
PG  - 789-96; discussion 797
AB  - Desloratadine is the orally active major metabolite of the nonsedating
      H1-antihistamine loratadine. The drug had no adverse cardiovascular effects in
      various animal models or when administered at 9 times the recommended adult
      dosage for 10 days in volunteers. Therapeutic dosages had no effects on
      wakefulness or psychomotor performance in healthy volunteers. No clinically
      significant interactions have been reported between desloratadine and drugs that 
      inhibit the cytochrome P450 system, nor does the drug potentiate the adverse
      psychomotor effects of alcohol. Oral desloratadine 5 mg once daily for up to 4
      weeks in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) significantly reduced
      nasal (including congestion) and non-nasal symptoms and improved health-related
      quality of life compared with placebo. Similar beneficial effects were observed
      in patients with SAR and coexisting asthma (in whom asthma symptoms and use of
      beta2-agonists were reduced). Desloratadine 5 mg once daily for 6 weeks
      significantly improved pruritus and reduced the number of hives compared with
      placebo in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). Sleep and daytime
      performance also improved. Desloratadine was well tolerated in clinical trials
      and had an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo in patients with SAR 
      (with or without asthma) or CIU.

TI  - Modulation of the immediate allergic wheal reaction in the skin by drugs
      inhibiting the effects of leukotriene C4 and prostaglandin D2.
PG  - 1-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), zafirlukast
      and indomethacin on the size of the size of the allergic prick-test wheal.
      METHOD: In the first part of the study, NDGA and indomethacin, as well as the
      mepyramine control (10 micrograms/ml and 100 micrograms/ml), were injected
      intracutaneously 10 min before prick-testing with the cow dander allergen in 51
      sensitised atopic subjects. In the second part, five other subjects were
      prick-tested with several allergens followed by administration of 40 mg
      zafirlukast or 100 mg indomethacin and re-prick-testing 2 h or 4 h later.
      RESULTS: The intracutaneous indomethacin at both concentrations enlarged the
      wheal by 27 +/- 50% and 29 +/- 51% (P < 0.02, n = 51), respectively. Likewise,
      the peroral indomethacin significantly increased the wheal area by 17 +/- 30% (P 
      = 0.035, n = 5). Neither intracutaneous NDGA in 51 subjects nor peroral
      zafirlukast in 5 subjects had marked effects on the size of the prick-test wheal.
      As expected, mepyramine (10 micrograms/ml) decreased the wheal area by 33 +/- 32%
      (P < 0.001, n = 51), but 14 subjects did not show any decrease after
      administration of this H1-antihistamine. CONCLUSION: The prostaglandin synthesis 
      inhibitor (indomethacin) augments the prick-test wheal, but the leukotriene
      synthesis inhibitor (NDGA) and leukotriene C4 antagonist (zafirlukast) have no
      marked effects on the size of the prick-test wheal.

      rhinitis.
PG  - 518-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of cetirizine and nimesulide given alone and in
      combination in allergic rhinitis. METHOD: A double blind, double dummy,
      randomised, parallel controlled clinical study in three groups consisting of 18
      patients each suffering from allergic rhinitis was conducted. Group A was given
      nimesulide alone (100 mg BD), Group B received combination (nimesulide 100 mg +
      cetirizine 10 mg) and Group C was given cetirizine alone (10 mg) for one week.
      The efficacy of each treatment in reducing nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge,
      itching nose and watery eyes was assessed at base line (day 0), on days four and 
      eight of treatment. Patients used diary cards twice daily to rate symptom
      severity on a four point scale. RESULTS: Nimesulide and cetirizine alone could
      decrease nasal discharge, nasal stuffiness and sneezing significantly in allergic
      rhinitis patients by day four. Cetirizine was more effective in relieving nasal
      discharge and sneezing compared to nimesulide. By combining cetirizine and
      nimesulide four symptoms of allergic rhinitis, i.e., nasal discharge, nasal
      stuffiness, sneezing and watery eyes decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: Present
      study has shown that nimesulide alone could decrease three symptoms of allergic
      rhinitis like certirizine and combination of cetirizine (anti-histaminic) and
      nimesulide (anti-inflammatory) exerts synergistic action in reducing symptoms in 
      patients of allergic rhinitis.

TI  - A randomized trial of leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast in
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis of adults.
PG  - 209-13
AB  - Leukotriene receptor antagonists are recommended for the treatment of asthma, and
      have proved anecdotally successful even in atopic dermatitis. Standard treatments
      of atopic dermatitis are often unsatisfactory. Accordingly, we compared
      montelukast, 10 mg/day, with a combined regimen (orally administered cetirizine
      and clarythromycin, topical corticosteroids and hydrating preparations) for
      treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis of adults. The trial was
      designed as a randomized single-blind study. SCORAD, eosinophilic cationic
      protein (ECP), eosinophilic protein X (EPX) serum levels were assessed at
      baseline and after 6 weeks in 32 adult patients with atopic dermatitis (16
      treated with montelukast; 16 treated with the combined regimen). Similar
      improvements, evaluated in term of SCORAD reductions, were detected in both
      groups (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05), while ECP and EPX levels significantly reduced
      within each group (Welch's approximate t, p < 0.05). We conclude that montelukast
      is as effective as the comparison combined regimen to treat atopic dermatitis of 
      adults.

TI  - Children's school performance is not impaired by short-term administration of
      diphenhydramine or loratadine.
PG  - 656-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a second-generation
      H1 antihistamine produces less sedation in children and permits greater learning 
      in a school setting than a classic antihistamine. STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-three 8- to
      10-year-old children who had histories of seasonal allergic rhinitis but had no
      symptoms at the time of the study were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups: placebo, diphenhydramine, or loratadine. Medications were administered on
      3 of 4 study days, twice 6 hours apart, while participants attended a laboratory 
      school. Classroom testing at the end of each school day evaluated the children's 
      retention of curriculum material. Potential sedative effects were additionally
      evaluated by self-report of somnolence and computerized reaction-time testing.
      RESULTS: No treatment-related differences emerged on the verbal instruction
      score, reading test score, reaction time, or somnolence scale. CONCLUSIONS:
      Learning and response time in children attending a laboratory school were not
      significantly affected by either antihistamine.

TI  - Local safety of intranasal triamcinolone acetonide: clinical and histological
      aspects of nasal mucosa in the long-term treatment of perennial allergic
      rhinitis.
PG  - 17-22
AB  - Intranasal corticosteroids are increasingly used to treat allergic rhinitis and
      their long-term use is generally safe. However, the long-term safety of each
      molecule should be assessed. The main aim of this multicenter, prospective,
      randomized, open-label study was to evaluate the effect of triamcinolone
      acetonide aqueous intranasal spray on nasal mucosal thickness, macroscopic
      appearance, and mucociliary function. Patients with perennial allergic rhinitis
      were treated with triamcinolone acetonide 220 micrograms/day for six months.
      Nasal biopsies taken before and after treatment were compared with biopsies from 
      patients who had been randomized to oral cetirizine 10 mg day or intranasal
      beclomethasone dipropionate 400 micrograms/day. In the evaluable population (n = 
      70), there were no significant differences between groups in terms of
      histologically evaluated thickness and endoscopically evaluated macroscopic
      appearance of the nasal mucosa, or indigocarmine saccharine test mucociliary
      function. In the intent-to-treat population (n = 92), there was no difference
      between treatment groups in the incidence of overall adverse events. This study
      indicates that sustained treatment with intranasal triamcinolone acetonide does
      not lead to atrophy of the nasal mucosa or impairment of mucociliary function.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and safety profile of desloratadine and fexofenadine when
      coadministered with azithromycin: a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study.
PG  - 451-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Significant cardiac toxicity has been associated with some older
      antihistamines (eg, terfenadine and astemizole) when their plasma concentrations 
      are increased. There is thus a need for a thorough assessment of the cardiac
      safety of newer antihistamine compounds. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to 
      assess the effects of coadministration of desloratadine or fexofenadine with
      azithromycin on pharmacokinetic parameters, tolerability, and
      electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. METHODS: Healthy volunteers aged 19 to 46
      years participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      third-party-blind, multiple-dose study. Subjects received desloratadine 5 mg once
      daily, fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily, or placebo for 7 days. An azithromycin
      loading dose (500 mg) followed by azithromycin 250 mg once daily for 4 days was
      administered concomitantly starting on day 3. Group 1 received desloratadine and 
      azithromycin, group 2 received desloratadine and placebo, group 3 received
      placebo and azithromycin, group 4 received fexofenadine and azithromycin, and
      group 5 received fexofenadine and placebo. RESULTS: The results of the
      pharmacokinetic analysis revealed little change in mean maximum concentration
      (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values for desloratadine
      with concomitant administration of azithromycin: Cmax ratio, 115% (90% CI,
      92-144); AUC, ratio 105% (90% CI, 82-134). The corresponding ratios for
      3-hydroxydesloratadine were 115% (90% CI, 98-136) and 104% (90% CI, 88-122),
      respectively. A substantial increase was observed in mean Cmax and AUC values for
      fexofenadine when administered with azithromycin: Cmax, ratio, 169% (90% CI,
      120-237); AUC ratio, 167% (90% CI, 122-229). Compared with the group receiving
      desloratadine and azithromycin, subjects receiving fexofenadine and azithromycin 
      also displayed greater variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for the
      antihistamine. Mean Cmax and AUC values of azithromycin were slightly higher when
      administered with desloratadine (Cmax ratio, 131% [90% CI, 92-187]; AUC ratio,
      112% [90% CI, 83-153]) but were lower when given in combination with fexofenadine
      (Cmax ratio, 87% [90% CI, 61-124]; AUC ratio, 88% [90% CI, 65-1201). The most
      common adverse event for all regimens was headache, reported in 20 (22%)
      subjects. All combinations of desloratadine or fexofenadine with and without
      azithromycin were well tolerated, and no statistically significant changes in PR,
      QT, or QT, interval, QRS complex, or ventricular rate were observed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Small increases (<15%) in mean pharmacokinetics of desloratadine were observed
      with coadministration of azithromycin. By contrast, peak fexofenadine
      concentrations were increased by 69% and the AUC was increased by 67% in the
      presence of the azalide antibiotic. Based on the reported adverse-events profile 
      and the absence of changes in ECG parameters, the combination of desloratadine
      and azithromycin was well tolerated. This study suggests that desloratadine has a
      more favorable drug-interaction potential than does fexofenadine.

TI  - Effect of cetirizine, levocetirizine, and dextrocetirizine on histamine-induced
      nasal response in healthy adult volunteers.
PG  - 339-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cetirizine, an effective H1-receptor antagonist, is a racemate
      mixture of two enantiomers: levocetirizine (R enantiomer) and dextrocetirizine (S
      enantiomer). METHODS: To investigate the pharmacologic activity of the two
      enantiomers of cetirizine, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, four-way,
      crossover study to assess the effect of treatment with 5 mg levocetirizine, 5 mg 
      dextrocetirizine, and 10 mg cetirizine and matched placebo, on histamine-induced 
      changes in the nasal airways of 24 healthy volunteers. Four hours after a single 
      oral intake, all subjects were challenged by nasal aerosol application with
      increasing doubling concentrations (from 0.25 to 32 mg/ml) of histamine in both
      nostrils. Nasal resistance was measured by passive anterior rhinomanometry (PAR),
      and changes in histamine threshold were calculated together with the absolute
      number of sneezes after each challenge. RESULTS: Both levocetirizine and
      cetirizine significantly attenuated the histamine-induced increase in nasal
      airway resistance by nearly 50% (from a median resistance of 2.51 Pa per cm3/s to
      1.29 and 1.31 Pa per cm3/s, respectively) at the maximal concentration, and they 
      concomitantly increased the histamine threshold by fourfold (from 8 to 32 mg/ml),
      compared with placebo. Sneezing was also attenuated by both levocetirizine and
      cetirizine. However, these antihistaminic effects were not seen with
      dextrocetirizine. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a similar activity of
      levocetirizine and cetirizine on the inhibition of histamine-induced increase in 
      nasal resistance, indicating that the antihistaminic properties of cetirizine are
      probably attributable to levocetirizine.

TI  - Once-daily desloratadine improves the signs and symptoms of chronic idiopathic
      urticaria: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 72-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is the most common type of chronic
      urticaria, and pruritus is the most prominent symptom. Antihistamines are the
      first-line treatment for CIU. Sedation and anticholinergic adverse effects are
      often experienced with the first-generation antihistamines and there is a risk of
      cardiovascular adverse effects and drug interactions with some second-generation 
      agents. Hence, new treatment options are needed. Desloratadine is a new, potent, 
      nonsedating antihistamine that has an excellent cardiovascular safety profile.
      METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of desloratadine in the
      treatment of moderate-to-severe CIU. A total of 190 patients, aged 12-79 years,
      with at least a 6-week history of CIU and who were currently experiencing a flare
      of at least moderate severity, were randomly assigned to therapy with
      desloratadine 5 mg or placebo once daily for 6 weeks. Twice daily, patients rated
      the severity of CIU symptoms (pruritus, number of hives, and size of largest
      hive), as well as the impact of CIU symptoms on sleep and daily activity.
      Patients and investigators jointly evaluated therapeutic response and overall
      condition. Safety evaluations included the incidence of treatment-emergent
      adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and changes from baseline
      in vital signs, laboratory parameters, and ECG intervals. RESULTS: Desloratadine 
      was superior to placebo in controlling pruritus and total symptoms after the
      first dose and maintained this superiority to the end of the study. Measures of
      sleep, daily activity, therapeutic response, and global CIU status were also
      significantly better with desloratadine after the first dose; these clinical
      benefits were also maintained throughout the 6-week study. No significant adverse
      events occured. CONCLUSIONS: Desloratadine 5 mg daily is a safe and effective
      treatment for CIU with significant benefits within 24 h and maintained through
      the treatment period.

PG  - 272-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied H1 antihistaminic safety, with respect to CNS, and
      clinical trial validity to determine its adverse effects and generalize the
      results. METHODS AND RESULTS: We employed clinical trials published between
      1990-94, selecting them according to several quality criterion to obtain reliable
      and extrapolable conclusions. Patients that use modern antihistaminics have less 
      adverse effects (32.5%), than those patients that use classics ones (78.6%) and
      similar to placebo (27.7%). Loratadine (28.4%) and noberastine (22.3%) are the
      antihistaminics with less adverse effects. Sedation (13.2%) and fatigue (4.9%)
      are the adverse effects more frequently produced by antihistaminics. Headache
      (6.7%) that is a frequent adverse effect, has a doubtful causality relationship
      with the use of antihistaminic. CONCLUSIONS: Second generation antihistaminics
      have less adverse effects and similar efficacy than classics ones. Noberastine
      and loratadine are the antihistaminics with less adverse effects in this study.

TI  - Effects of sublingual immunotherapy in patients sensitised to Ambrosia. An open
      controlled study.
PG  - 311-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergy to Ambrosia is a disease of growing importance in Europe.
      Injective and non-injective immunotherapy have been recognised as safe and
      effective but no evidence is currently available for sublingual immunotherapy
      (SLIT) in patients sensitised to Ambrosia. This study was planned to assess the
      effects and the safety of SLIT in patients clinically sensitised to Ambrosia.
      METHODS: 19 patients clinically sensitised to Ambrosia and treated with SLIT were
      compared to 14 patients treated only with drugs. Diary cards with symptoms and
      drug consumption were filled-in by patients during the pollen season whereas
      specific nasal challenge and skin prick test were run two months before and after
      the pollen season. Patients and doctors were also asked to express their
      subjective assessment about symptoms and drug consumption during the season.
      RESULTS: SLIT-treated patients had less symptoms and a significantly minor drug
      intake (p = 0.04) as compared to untreated patients. Nasal challenge test
      improved significantly in the SLIT group (p = 0.0001) but not in the control
      group (p = 0.6875) with a significant difference between groups at the end (p =
      0.0413) but not at the beginning of the trial (p = 0.213). The decrease in skin
      reactivity was significant in the control group (p = 0.0186) and highly
      significant in the SLIT group (p < 0.0001), with no difference between groups (p 
      = 0.2987). Subjective assessment from both patients and doctors was favorable to 
      SLIT (p = 0.0005 for symptoms; p = 0.0019 for drug consumption). Only one minor
      local side effect was registered during SLIT. CONCLUSIONS: According to our data,
      SLIT in patients allergic to Ambrosia is safe and able to improve both subjective
      and objective parameters.

TI  - New combination therapies for asthma.
PG  - 62-8
AB  - Combination products often have useful clinical benefits in asthma. The
      scientific rationale for combination therapy includes the fact that different
      agents have complimentary modes of action. Long-acting beta(2)-agonists have
      effects on airway smooth muscle, and inhaled corticosteroids have potent topical 
      antiinflammatory effect. This combination has been shown to effectively reduce
      exacerbations and improve symptoms. Substantial clinical trial data provide a
      rationale for dual-control therapy supported by basic scientific data. Another
      combined therapy is inhaled steroids plus leukotriene-receptor antagonists, which
      provides the patient with two effective therapies. Leukotriene-receptor
      antagonist can also be combined with antihistamines for improved asthma control. 
      Older therapies including theophylline and controlled release albuterol have been
      effectively added to inhaled corticosteroids, enabling a reduction in the dose of
      the inhaled steroids. Many other combination therapies are presently being
      tested.

TI  - Sure outcomes of random events: a model for clinical trials.
PG  - 521-43
AB  - We consider the outcomes of a clinical trial as determined by one, or several,
      possibly hidden causes. This paper proposes a statistical model that allows such 
      a distinction of causes not only for the main, or therapeutic, effects but also
      for the side, or toxic, effects. More specifically, we focus on trials where the 
      effects are naturally dichotomized, that is, where the health of a patient has
      improved or not, and where a specific adverse effect has occurred or not. A case 
      study provides an example of the way this model can help to solve some problems
      of suspected drug toxicity. Finally, the model is shown to be a part of a
      hierarchy of models and the way to select a best model is investigated.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, crossover comparison among cetirizine,
      levocetirizine, and ucb 28557 on histamine-induced cutaneous responses in healthy
      adult volunteers.
PG  - 50-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cetirizine is a highly efficacious and long-acting second-generation 
      H1-receptor antagonist for the treatment of allergic diseases, such as allergic
      rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, in adults and children. Pharmacologic 
      studies have demonstrated that cetirizine, a racemate mixture composed of equal
      amounts of two enantiomers, does not undergo hepatic metabolism to any
      significant level. The enantiomers are excreted mainly unchanged, predominantly
      in the urine and to a lesser extent in the faeces. METHODS: The pharmacologic
      activity and potency of the two enantiomers of cetirizine in the management of
      allergic skin conditions were investigated by studying the effect of treatment
      with 5.0 mg cetirizine; 2.5 mg levocetirizine, the (R)-enantiomer; and 2.5 mg ucb
      28557, the (S)-enantiomer, on histamine-induced wheal and flare response in 18
      healthy volunteers. Each treatment was administered as a single oral dose in
      randomized, double-blind, and crossover manner, and the efficacy of treatment was
      assessed over a period of 32 h, as per cent inhibition of the histamine-induced
      wheal and flare areas before treatment. Blood and urine samples were collected in
      a time-dependent manner and analyzed for the total amounts of each study drug, to
      elucidate their pharmacokinetic profiles. RESULTS: Both cetirizine and
      levocetirizine caused a marked inhibition of histamine-induced wheal and flare,
      whereas ucb 28557 was inactive in this model. Inhibition of the wheal response
      observed for cetirizine and levocetirizine was apparent by 1 h after dosage and
      lasted for mean durations of 24.4 and 28.4 h, respectively. In addition, the
      response for cetirizine and levocetirizine became maximal by 6 h after treatment,
      rising to 79.5% and 83.8%. Similarly, cetirizine and levocetirizine also markedly
      inhibited the histamine-induced flare response. This effect was evident for both 
      drugs by 1 h after dosage and lasted over a mean period of 28.4 and 26.0 h,
      respectively, for cetirizine and levocetirizine. The inhibitory effect of these
      compounds on histamine-induced flare response was also maximal by approximately 6
      h after dosage, peaking at 88.5%) and 83.6%, respectively. Statistical evaluation
      showed that cetirizine and levocetirizine were equivalent for maximum inhibition 
      of histamine-induced wheal and flare. However, levocetirizine was found to be
      superior to cetirizine when area under the curve was compared. In contrast, ucb
      28557 was not found to inhibit histamine-induced wheal and flare responses at any
      time during the study period. Plasma concentrations of levocetirizine were found 
      to be approximately double those of ucb 28557 at 4 and 8 h after dosing, and
      50-60% of the drugs were excreted unchanged in urine over a period of 32 h.
      CONCLUSIONS: The finding that, in this model, levocetirizine 2.5 mg has
      comparable antihistaminic activity to cetirizine 5 mg, whereas its other
      enantiomer ucb 28557 has no pharmacodynamic effect, suggests that the
      antihistaminic properties of cetirizine observed in the management of allergic
      skin conditions are likely to be attributable to levocetirizine.

TI  - Effects of cetirizine and epinastine on the skin response to histamine
      iontophoresis.
PG  - 59-63
AB  - Epinastine and cetirizine are second-generation, nonsedating and long-lasting
      antihistamines that are now frequently used for the allergic disorders. We have
      examined the inhibitory effects of these two drugs on the histamine-induced flare
      and wheal responses using iontophoresis at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h after the oral
      administration by a double-blind, cross-over and placebo-controlled study. Both
      cetirizine and epinastine significantly inhibited the histamine-induced flare and
      wheal responses at 2 h after the oral administration when compared with placebo. 
      The inhibitory effects of cetirizine and epinastine on the flare response lasted 
      long until at 24 h, however, epinastine was less potent than cetirizine. The
      inhibitory effects on the wheal response was also clearly and significantly
      evident at 2-8 h by cetirizine and epinastine. At 24 h cetirizine only showed the
      significant inhibition on the histamine-induced wheal response. In contrast,
      epinastine seemed to exhibit the inhibitory capacity earlier than did cetirizine.
      The inhibitory action of the drugs on the histamine-induced wheal response peaked
      at 4 h after the oral administration. The histamine-induced itch sensation was
      also markedly or completely suppressed at 2-8 h by the drugs. Thus, both drugs
      exhibited the potent and long-lasting antihistamine activity on the skin
      responses induced by histamine iontophoresis.

TI  - The changing face of antihistamines and cardiac adverse drug reactions: a
      clinical perspective.
PG  - 397-9
AB  - Recent times have witnessed a qualitative shift in the recognition and management
      of adverse drug effects. Many of them occur in organs that are unconnected to the
      primary target of pharmacological action. Out of these, cardiac side-effects have
      drawn particular attention because of their potential to cause death. Starting
      with the early observations on antibiotics such as macrolides, followed by
      fluoroquinolones and others, the focus has now shifted to the antihistamine class
      of drugs which are used extensively by patients all over the world, thanks to the
      ever increasing levels of environmental pollution. The occurrence of prolonged
      QTc interval following treatment with terfenadine leading to ventricular
      tachycardia of torsades de points variety with a potentially fatal outcome has
      forced many regulatory authorities of the world to clamp a ban the use of this
      drug. Alerted by these developments, studies on a new member, followed by
      fluoroquinolones and others, the focus has now shifted to the antihistamine class
      of drugs which are used extensively by patients all over the world, thanks to the
      ever incresing levels of envrionmental pollution. The occurrence of prolonged QTc
      interval following treatment with terfenadine leading to ventricular tachycardia 
      of torsades de points variety with a potentially fatal outcome has forced many
      regulatory authorities of the world to clamp a ban use of this drug. Alerted by
      these developments, studies on a new member of non-sedating antihistamine class
      viz, fexofenadine, have been reviewed especially because of the structural
      similarity between terfenadine and fexofenadine. It is now clear that despite the
      closeness of its chemical structure to terfenadine fexofenadine behaves in a
      different manner and does not affect the electrophysiology of the heart muscle
      tissue, as proved by data from extensive clinical trials as well as membrane
      models in vitro. Interestingly, the solitary false alarm that was sounded on the 
      drug by a group of workers in the Netherlands was later rectified by the same
      group. Clinically speaking, the cardiovascular safety of fexofenadine has been
      convincingly demonstrated at various dose levels and various time intervals,
      alone and together with other drugs of potential toxigenicity. All things put
      together, it appears reasonable to conclude that fexofenadine is free from
      cardiovascular ADRs of clinical significance. It could also be concluded that
      cardiac side-effects of antihistamines is not a class effect.

TI  - Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and electrocardiographic pharmacodynamics of
      loratadine with concomitant administration of ketoconazole or cimetidine.
PG  - 581-9
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate whether ketoconazole or cimetidine alter the pharmacokinetics
      of loratadine, or its major metabolite, desloratadine (DCL), or alter the effects
      of loratadine or DCL on electrocardiographic repolarization in healthy adult
      volunteers. METHODS: Two randomized, evaluator-blind, multiple-dose, three-way
      crossover drug interaction studies were performed. In each study, subjects
      received three 10 day treatments in random sequence, separated by a 14 day
      washout period. The treatments were loratadine alone, cimetidine or ketoconazole 
      alone, or loratadine plus cimetidine or ketoconazole. The primary study endpoint 
      was the difference in mean QTc intervals from baseline to day 10. In addition,
      plasma concentrations of loratadine, DCL, and ketoconazole or cimetidine were
      obtained on day 10. RESULTS: Concomitant administration of loratadine and
      ketoconazole significantly increased the loratadine plasma concentrations (307%; 
      90% CI 205-428%) and DCL concentrations (73%; 62-85%) compared with
      administration of loratadine alone. Concomitant administration of loratadine and 
      cimetidine significantly increased the loratadine plasma concentrations (103%
      increase; 70-142%) but not DCL concentrations (6% increase; 1-11%) compared with 
      administration of loratadine alone. Cimetidine or ketoconazole plasma
      concentrations were unaffected by coadministration with loratadine. Despite
      increased concentrations of loratadine and DCL, there were no statistically
      significant differences for the primary electrocardiographic repolarization
      parameter (QTc) among any of the treatment groups. No other clinically relevant
      changes in the safety profile of loratadine were observed as assessed by
      electrocardiographic parameters (mean (90% CI) QTc changes: loratadine vs
      loratadine + ketoconazole = 3.6 ms (-2.2, 9.4); loratadine vs loratadine +
      cimetidine = 3.2 ms (-1.6, 7.9)), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and
      adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Loratadine 10 mg daily was devoid of any effects on 
      electrocardiographic parameters when coadministered for 10 days with therapeutic 
      doses of ketoconazole or cimetidine in healthy volunteers. It is concluded that, 
      although there was a significant pharmacokinetic drug interaction between
      ketoconazole or cimetidine and loratadine, this effect was not accompanied by a
      change in the QTc interval in healthy adult volunteers.

TI  - Local nasal immunotherapy and bronchial hyperreactivity in seasonal allergic
      rhinitis: an observational pilot study.
PG  - 300-4
AB  - The clinical efficacy of local nasal immunotherapy (LNIT) in patients with
      allergic rhinitis is amply documented. The aim of the study was to determine the 
      effect on bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) assessed at baseline and after 3
      years of LNIT or pharmacological treatment alone. Forty-three randomized patients
      with allergic oculorhinitis were enrolled (26 positive to Graminaceae and 17 to
      Parietaria judaica pollens). All patients were asked whether they were willing to
      follow a 3-year treatment course involving preseasonal LNIT with a powder extract
      of Graminaceae or Parietaria pollens. Twenty-four patients (16 allergic to
      Graminaceae and eight to Parietaria) selected LNIT and the other 19 opted for
      symptomatic pharmacological treatment only. The latter was considered the control
      group. On the basis of positive or negative bronchial hyperresponsiveness and the
      LNIT, four subgroups were established and followed in open conditions, during
      which a record was kept of symptom scores, drug use, spirometry and methacholine 
      test findings. After 3 years, patients treated with LNIT had a significant
      reduction of symptoms and drug intake. In the controls, symptoms worsened, thus
      requiring more drugs to control them. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness significantly
      improved in hyperreactive patients receiving LN7IT 10 of whom were no longer
      hyperreactive and one at a higher threshold. Among controls, bronchial
      hyperresponsiveness did not change, with the exception of three nonreactive
      patients who became hyperreactive, one of them with asthma. These findings
      confirm the efficacy of LNIT in allergic rhinitis suggesting that it might have
      systemic activity interfering with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and hence the
      onset of bronchial asthma.

TI  - Activity of ebastine (10 and 20 mg) and cetirizine at 24 hours of a steady state 
      treatment in the skin of healthy volunteers.
PG  - 409-13
AB  - We have compared the inhibitory effects of ebastine (10 mg), ebastine (20 mg) and
      cetirizine (10 mg) on histamine-induced wheal and flare skin reactions 24 h
      following a 6-day-long treatment. This was a double-blind, randomised, crossover,
      placebo-controlled study involving 24 healthy volunteers (18-65 years) with
      negative skin prick tests and the absence of specific IgEs to common allergens.
      Subjects were randomised to receive each of the following treatments once daily
      for 6 days: ebastine (10 mg), ebastine (20 mg), cetirizine (10 mg) or placebo
      with a washout period of 5 days. Twenty-four hours after the last dose of each
      treatment, histamine skin prick tests were performed (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 
      50, 100 and 200 mg/mL), and wheal and flare responses were measured. All active
      treatments produced significant inhibition of the wheal responses compared to
      placebo (P < 0.001). Wheal response inhibition was significantly better with 20
      mg of ebastine compared with 10 mg of ebastine and 10 mg of cetirizine. In a
      comparison to histamine concentrations required to produce a wheal surface area
      of 10 mm2, 20 mg of ebastine was also significantly better than ebastine 10 mg
      and cetirizine (P < 0.001), and 10 mg ebastine was significantly better than
      cetirizine (P < 0.05). Highly significant (P < 0.001) effects on the flare
      response were observed with each active treatment compared to placebo, with no
      difference between groups. The frequency of adverse events, primarily somnolence,
      was similar among the four treatment groups. Our results clearly indicate that
      ebastine, at either recommended dosage of 10 and 20 mg, and cetirizine produced
      significant inhibition of the histamine-induced wheal and flare reaction compared
      to placebo for up to 24 h. A superior efficacy of 20 mg of ebastine is observed
      compared with 10 mg of ebastine and 10 mg of cetirizine on the skin wheal
      response 24 h after the last dose of a 6-day-long treatment. This study clearly
      proves ebastine to be an effective, truly once-daily antihistamine.

TI  - Impact of interventions designed to increase market share and prescribing of
      fexofenadine at HMOs.
PG  - 1778-85
AB  - The impact of interventions designed to shift prescribing from loratadine to
      fexofenadine at HMOs was studied. Pharmacy claims data for a six-month
      preintervention period at four HMOs were analyzed to identify all new and refill 
      prescriptions for loratadine, fexofenadine, astemizole, and cetirizine. The
      interventions consisted of a mandatory lockout of loratadine in favor of
      fexofenadine (at HMO A), a voluntary switch to fexofenadine promoted through
      letters to both physicians and members (HMO B), and a voluntary switch promoted
      through letters to physicians only (HMO C). There was no intervention at HMO D.
      Pharmacy claims data for the six months after each intervention program was
      implemented were analyzed to determine changes in the market share and
      prescribing of the study drugs. After the intervention programs were implemented,
      the market share of fexofenadine increased from 18.9% to 65.2% at HMO A, from
      14.8% to 21.0% at HMO B, and from 20.7% to 23.8% at HMO C. Loratadine's market
      share decreased from 62.3% to 8.7% at HMO A, from 67.5% to 58.6% at HMO B, and
      from 70.5% to 65.3% at HMO C. HMOs A, B, and C each had greater shifts in market 
      share for fexofenadine and loratadine than the control HMO. Changes in
      prescribing followed a similar pattern for the 25 physicians at each HMO who had 
      most frequently prescribed loratadine during the preintervention period. The
      average cost per antihistamine prescription decreased 22.3% at HMO A.
      Prescription costs continued to rise at HMOs B, C, and D. Mandating the use of
      fexofenadine produced a significant increase in its market share, reduced the
      cost of nonsedating antihistamines, and successfully influenced prescribing
      behavior. Voluntary programs had a more modest impact on market share and did not
      stop increases in prescription costs.

TI  - A randomized phase 2 study of PBPC mobilization by stem cell factor and
      filgrastim in heavily pretreated patients with Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.
PG  - 471-81
AB  - This randomized, controlled study compared the ability to mobilize and collect an
      optimal target yield of 5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg using stem cell factor (SCF; 20 
      microg/kg/day) plus filgrastim (G-CSF; 10 microg/kg/day) vs filgrastim alone (10 
      microg/kg/day) in 102 patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or
      Hodgkin's disease (HD), who were prospectively defined as being heavily
      pretreated. Leukapheresis began on day 5 of cytokine administration and continued
      daily until the target yield was reached, or until a maximum of five
      leukaphereses had been performed. Compared with the filgrastim-alone group (n =
      54), the SCF plus filgrastim group (n = 48) showed an increase in the proportion 
      of patients reaching the target yield within five leukaphereses (44% vs 17%, P = 
      0.002); reduction in the number of leukaphereses required to reach the target
      yield (P = 0.003); reduction in the proportion of patients failing to reach a
      minimum yield of 1 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg to proceed to transplant (16% vs 26%, P
      = NS); increase in the median yield of CD34+ cells per leukapheresis (0.73 x
      10(6)/kg vs 0.48 x 10(6)/kg, P = 0.04); and an increase in the median total CD34+
      cells collected within five leukaphereses (3.6 x 10(6)/kg vs 2.4 x 10(6)/kg, P = 
      0.05). All patients receiving SCF were premedicated (antihistamines and
      albuterol), and treatment was generally well tolerated. Five patients experienced
      severe mast cell-mediated reactions, none of which were life-threatening. In this
      study of heavily pretreated lymphoma patients, SCF plus filgrastim was more
      effective than filgrastim alone for mobilizing PBPC for harvesting and
      transplantation after high-dose chemotherapy.

TI  - Cetirizine inhibits bradykinin-induced cutaneous wheal and flare in atopic and
      healthy subjects.
PG  - 888-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kinins are vasoactive mediators involved in allergic reactions. When 
      applied on the skin or in the nose, bradykinin (BK) elicits inflammation that is 
      poorly affected by previous H1-blockade. The aim of this study was to compare the
      possible effect of cetirizine (an H1-antagonist) on wheal and flare responses to 
      BK, histamine, and compound 48/80 in atopic and healthy subjects. METHODS: In a
      randomized, double-blind, crossover study, eight atopic and eight healthy
      subjects received cetirizine (10 mg/day) or placebo for 3 days before cutaneous
      tests. Intradermal tests (IDT) and prick tests (PT) were performed with BK (20
      nmol/ml for IDT and 20 micromol/ml for PT), histamine (100 microg/ml IDT and 100 
      mg/ml PT), and compound 48/80 (100 microg/ml IDT and 100 mg/ml PT) as positive
      controls and saline as negative control. The skin responses were monitored by
      measurement of wheal and flare areas. RESULTS: BK, histamine, and 48/80 induced
      wheal and flare reactions in all placebo-treated subjects. Histamine elicited
      larger wheal and flare reactions than BK and 48/80. IDT with BK induced four- to 
      six-fold larger wheal and flare reaction than PT. No differences in BK-induced
      wheal and flare were observed between atopic and healthy subjects. In atopic
      subjects, cetirizine induced a significant reduction of flare reactions after the
      BK test (80% for IDT, and 94% for PT [P<0.01]). Moreover, cetirizine reduced
      significantly BK-induced wheals by 70% for IDT (P<0.01) and 65% for PT (P<0.01). 
      A similar inhibiting effect of cetirizine was also observed in healthy subjects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that the wheal and flare reactions induced by 
      BK challenge were markedly inhibited by previous intake of cetirizine. The
      mechanism by which this effect is mediated cannot be established at present.

TI  - Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in combination with loratadine, a
      histamine receptor antagonist, in the treatment of chronic asthma.
PG  - 2481-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Montelukast sodium, a potent, oral, specific leukotriene-receptor
      antagonist, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of chronic
      asthma. Loratadine, a selective histamine type 1 (H(1))-receptor antagonist, has 
      demonstrated antiallergic properties. Leukotriene-receptor antagonists given
      concomitantly with H(1)-receptor antagonists have been shown to have additive
      effects in the prevention of bronchospasm in antigen-challenge models. OBJECTIVE:
      To determine whether montelukast plus loratadine provides improved efficacy to
      montelukast alone in the treatment of chronic asthma. METHODS: The efficacy of
      montelukast alone vs montelukast-loratadine was studied in a 10-week,
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 2 x 2 crossover study. After a 2-week
      placebo run-in period, patients received montelukast sodium (10 mg) plus
      loratadine (20 mg), or montelukast sodium (10 mg) plus placebo once daily for 2
      weeks. After a 2-week placebo washout period, patients were crossed over to
      receive 2 weeks of the other active treatment regimen, followed by another 2-week
      placebo washout period. RESULTS: Montelukast given concomitantly with loratadine 
      caused significant improvement in percentage of change from baseline in forced
      expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) compared with montelukast alone (13.86% vs
      9.72%; P =.001). The average additional effect of loratadine (least square mean
      difference in percentage of change from baseline in FEV(1)) was 4.15% (95%
      confidence interval, 1.65%-6.65%). Key secondary end points (mean daily
      beta-agonist use, daytime and nighttime symptom scores, morning and evening peak 
      expiratory flow rate, and the Patient Global Evaluation) all showed significant
      improvement with montelukast-loratadine (P<.05). CONCLUSION:
      Montelukast-loratadine significantly improved end points of asthma control during
      a 2-week treatment period.

TI  - Clinical and pathologic methods to assess the long-term safety of nasal
      corticosteroids. French Triamcinolone Acetonide Study Group.
PG  - 718-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main objective of this long-term prospective local safety study
      was to evaluate endoscopic and histologic changes in nasal epithelium after
      6-month treatment with triamcinolone acetonide (TAA). We describe here a method
      to measure quantitatively epithelium thickness. Results were compared with those 
      seen with the use of cetirizine (an antihistamine) and another oral intranasal
      corticosteroid, beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP). METHODS: Patients were
      examined by an ENT specialist who first performed an endoscopic evaluation of the
      nasal cavities, assessing any morphologic abnormalities and the aspect of the
      mucosa. Biopsies were taken from the inferior turbinate before and after 24 weeks
      of treatment. Biopsies were immediately fixed in cold acetone (-20 degrees C) and
      embedded in glycolmethacrylate; sections of 2 microm were cut on an
      ultramicrotome. Morphometric evaluations were done in a blinded fashion by
      computerized image analysis to measure an epithelial area over a minimum length
      of 50 microm. The thickness was ascertained by the ratio of area to length.
      RESULTS: 1) For all three treatment groups, the nasal epithelium thickness
      decreased slightly from pretreatment to the end of treatment. 2) No statistically
      significant differences between the three treatment groups were found in
      epithelium thickness. 3) Macroscopically, nasal tissues in all treated groups
      were normal. CONCLUSIONS: These results clearly indicate that long-term treatment
      with TAA has no atrophic effect on nasal mucosa.

TI  - Randomized double-blind study of cyclosporin in chronic 'idiopathic' urticaria.
PG  - 365-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Histamine-releasing activity (HRA) is detectable in up to 50% of
      patients with chronic ordinary urticaria. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of 
      cyclosporin on clinical features and HRA in patients with chronic urticaria.
      METHODS: Thirty patients with severe unremitting disease, responding poorly to
      antihistamines and showing a positive autologous serum skin test (ASST) as a
      marker of HRA, were randomized to 4 mg kg-1 daily of cyclosporin (Sandimmun, n = 
      20) or placebo (n = 10) for 4 weeks. Non-responders were offered open-label
      cyclosporin for 4 weeks. All were followed for up to 20 weeks or until clinical
      relapse; all took cetirizine 20 mg daily throughout the study. The primary
      measure of efficacy was a daily urticaria activity score (UAS) of weal numbers
      and itch (maximum score 42 per week). A positive response was defined as a
      reduction to < 25% of baseline weekly UAS and relapse as a return to > 75%. The
      effect of cyclosporin on serum HRA was assessed by in vitro basophil histamine
      release assays and ASSTs before and after treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-nine
      patients (19 active, 10 controls) completed the randomized trial medication.
      Eight of 19 on active treatment but none on placebo had responded at 4 weeks (P <
      0.05). Three others on active drug met the criterion for response at 2 weeks but 
      not at 4 weeks. Mean reduction in UAS between weeks 0 and 4 was 12.7 (95%
      confidence interval, CI 6.6-18.8) for active and 2.3 (95% CI - 3.3-7.9) for
      placebo (P = 0.005). Seventeen non-responders (seven randomized to active and 10 
      to placebo) chose open-label cyclosporin and 11 responded after 4 weeks. Six of
      the eight randomized active drug responders relapsed within 6 weeks. Of the 19
      responders to randomized and open-label cyclosporin, five (26%) had not relapsed 
      by the study end-point. Mean in vitro serum HRA fell from 36% (95% CI 22-49%) to 
      5% (95% CI 1-8%) after cyclosporin treatment (n = 11, P < 0.0001). The ASST
      response to post-treatment serum was also reduced (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This
      study shows that cyclosporin is effective for chronic urticaria and provides
      further evidence for a role of histamine-releasing autoantibodies in the
      pathogenesis of this chronic 'idiopathic' disease.

TI  - Loratadine in the treatment of mosquito-bite-sensitive children.
PG  - 668-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children frequently experience harmful whealing and delayed papules
      from mosquito bites. Whealing is mediated by antisaliva IgE antibodies and
      histamine, but the effect of antihistamines on mosquito-bite symptoms has not
      been evaluated in children. METHODS: The effect of loratadine (0.3 mg/kg) was
      examined in 28 mosquito-bite-sensitive children (aged 2-11 years). The
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed with exposure to 
      Aedes aegypti laboratory mosquitoes. The size of the bite lesion and the
      intensity of pruritus (visual analog scale) were measured at 15 min and at 2, 6, 
      and 24 h. RESULTS: Loratadine decreased the size of the wheals by 45% (P < 0.001,
      25 children) and accompanying pruritus by 78% (P = 0.011, 12 children) at 15 min 
      compared to placebo. The size of the 24-h delayed bite lesion also decreased
      significantly (P = 0.004), but there was no change at 2 or 6 h. Loratadine was
      well tolerated and no marked side-effects were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      in children shows that prophylactically given loratadine decreases significantly 
      the whealing and pruritus caused by mosquito bites and also reduces the size of
      the 24-h bite lesions. Therefore, the therapeutic profile of loratadine extends
      from immediate to delayed allergic symptoms in mosquito-bite-sensitive children.

TI  - Cetirizine and loratadine: a comparison using the ED50 in skin reactions.
PG  - 69-77
AB  - To quantify objectively the comparative potencies of the antihistamines,
      loratadine and cetirizine, we determined the dose that inhibits histamine-induced
      skin reactions by 50% of the maximum response (ED50) for each drug. Cetirizine at
      2.5, 5 or 10 mg, loratadine at 10, 20 or 40 mg or placebo were given to 14
      healthy female subjects in a randomized double-blind crossover design. Inhibition
      of the wheal and flare response to the histamine prick test (10, 100 and 500
      mg/ml) was evaluated. Depending on the histamine concentrations, the ED50s for
      wheals were in the ranges 4.3 - 4.7, 2.1 - 2.2 and 1.7 - 1.9 mg cetirizine, 2, 4 
      and 6 h after dosing, respectively. For loratadine, the ED50 for wheals were in
      the ranges 35.6 - > 40, 9.1 - 24.1 and 9.1 - 13.9 mg, 2, 4 and 6 h after dosing, 
      respectively. Calculation of the ED50 demonstrated that, on average, cetirizine
      is seven to nine times more potent than loratadine at inhibiting wheal and flare 
      reactions.

TI  - Further improvement of quality of life by cetirizine in perennial allergic
      rhinitis as a function of treatment duration.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - The SF-36 Health Status Questionnaire is a generic quality of life questionnaire 
      based on 36 questions selected to represent nine health concepts. Perennial
      allergic rhinitis is a disease which causes variable restrictions on the
      physical, psychological and social aspects of patients' lives. According to the
      SF-36 questionnaire assessment, quality of life is impaired in these patients.
      Cetirizine, a potent, reliable histamine H1-receptor antagonist, has already been
      found to induce significant improvement in the quality of life of patients with
      chronic rhinitis, as assessed by the same SF-36 questionnaire after 1 and 6 weeks
      of treatment. This paper further investigates the extent to which cetirizine
      continues to improve quality of life after a long-term treatment (6 weeks)
      compared to a shorter treatment (1 week). The analyses show that, despite the
      significant improvement found after 1 week of treatment with cetirizine compared 
      to placebo, a further 5-week course of therapy not only maintains this
      improvement but continues to enhance quality of life significantly above and
      beyond this.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics, electrocardiographic effects, and tolerability of
      loratadine syrup in children aged 2 to 5 years.
PG  - 613-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of 5 mg loratadine
      syrup (1 mg/mL) in children aged 2 to 5 years. METHODS: Two studies were
      undertaken. A single-dose, open-label bioavailability study was performed to
      characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles of loratadine and its metabolite
      desloratadine. Plasma concentrations of loratadine and desloratadine were
      determined at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after a single
      administration of 5 mg loratadine syrup to 18 healthy children (11 male, 7
      female; 12 black, 5 white, 1 other; mean age +/- SD, 3.8 +/- 1.1 years; mean
      weight +/- SD, 17.4 +/- 4.4 kg). In addition, a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was performed to assess the tolerability
      of 5 mg loratadine syrup after multiple doses. Loratadine (n = 60) or placebo (n 
      = 61) was given once daily for 15 days to children with a history of allergic
      rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria. In the loratadine group, 27 boys and 33
      girls (52 white, 8 black) were enrolled, with a mean age +/- SD of 3.67 +/- 1.13 
      years and a mean weight +/- SD of 17.2 +/- 3.8 kg. In the placebo group, 27 boys 
      and 34 girls (53 white, 7 black, 1 Asian) were enrolled, with a mean age +/- SD
      of 3.52 +/- 1.12 years and a mean weight +/- SD of 17.3 +/- 2.9 kg. Tolerability 
      was assessed based on electrocardiographic results, occurrence of adverse events,
      changes in vital signs, and results of laboratory tests and physical
      examinations. RESULTS: The peak plasma concentrations of loratadine and
      desloratadine were 7.78 and 5.09 ng/mL, respectively, observed 1.17 and 2.33
      hours after administration of loratadine; the areas under the plasma
      concentration-time curve to the last quantifiable time point for loratadine and
      desloratadine were 16.7 and 87.2 ng x h/mL, respectively. Single and multiple
      doses were well tolerated, with no adverse events occurring with greater
      frequency after multiple doses of loratadine than after placebo.
      Electrocardiographic parameters were not altered by loratadine compared with
      placebo. There were no clinically meaningful changes in other tolerability
      assessments. CONCLUSION: Loratadine was well tolerated in this small, selected
      group of children aged 2 to 5 years at a dose providing exposure similar to that 
      with the adult dose (ie, 10 mg once daily).

TI  - Loratadine versus cetirizine: assessment of somnolence and motivation during the 
      workday.
PG  - 573-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This parallel-group, double-blind study compared the somnolence and
      motivation profiles of 2 second-generation antihistamines, loratadine and
      cetirizine, in patients with allergic rhinitis. BACKGROUND: Second-generation
      antihistamines were developed to provide symptomatic relief from allergic
      disorders without the unwanted side effects of first-generation antihistamines,
      including somnolence. Recent research has indicated that not all
      second-generation antihistamines are comparable with respect to somnolence and
      other cognitive processes. METHODS: Patients aged > or = 12 years and actively
      exhibiting symptoms of allergic rhinitis were randomized to 2 treatment groups to
      receive 10 mg loratadine or 10 mg cetirizine daily at 8:00 AM for 1 week. After
      patients took the medication, their somnolence and degree of motivation to
      perform activities were recorded in an electronic diary using a visual analog
      scale 4 times during the workday (8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, noon, and 3:00 PM). RESULTS:
      Sixty patients (31 men, 29 women) were randomized to treatment. Somnolence scores
      were similar for both groups at baseline and at the time of dosing (8:00 AM).
      However, there was a statistically significant difference in somnolence scores
      between the loratadine and cetirizine groups at 10:00 AM (P = 0.008), noon (P =
      0.001), and 3:00 PM (P < 0.001), with the cetirizine group showing a greater
      degree of somnolence. The scores on motivation to perform activities were similar
      for both groups at the baseline and 8:00-AM measurements. In parallel with the
      somnolence scores, there were statistically significant differences in motivation
      scores between the loratadine and cetirizine groups at 10:00 AM (P = 0.014), noon
      (P = 0.001), and 3:00 PM (P < 0.001), indicating that patients taking loratadine 
      were relatively more motivated during the workday. CONCLUSION: The results of
      this study demonstrate that in patients aged > or = 12 years who had allergic
      rhinitis, cetirizine use promoted somnolence and decreased motivation to perform 
      activities during the workday compared with loratadine.

TI  - [Projection of new antihistamines].
PG  - 143-52
AB  - The metabolic fate of most antihistamines is not clearly established. The drugs
      usually appear to be extensively metabolized,mainly in the liver. Some second
      generation antihistamines are metabolized principally by the cytochrome P-450
      microsomal enzyme system, mainly by the isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), although other
      isoenzyme,including CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, also may be involved. However,other second
      generation antihistamines appear to be only minimally metabolized in the liver.
      Serious cardiac effects (prolongation of the QT interval, arrhythmias, torsades
      de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, arrest, hypotension, palpitations, syncope,
      dizziness, and/or death) have been reported rarely in patients receiving
      terfenadine or astemizole. Cardiotoxic effects ussually were associated with
      higher than recommended dosages and/or increased plasma concentrations of the
      drugs and their active metabolites. No clinically important adverse effects or
      changes in the QT intervals were reported after concomitant administration of
      ketoconazole with fexofenadine. Patients receiving an azole, antifungal, a
      macrolide, quinine or grapefruit juice also appear to be at substantial risk of
      such toxicity, probably secondary to interference with metabolism of the
      antihistamine. Second-generation H1 receptor antagonist have been studied
      extensively in the treatment of asthma. Many of these drugs have been reported to
      inhibit eosinophil and basophil chemotaxis and therefore might have an effect on 
      the inflammatory reactions that characterise this disease. Safe use of
      antihistamines during pregnancy has not been established; therefore, the drugs
      should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant unless the potential
      benefits justify the possible risks to the fetus. Antihistamines should not be
      administered to premature or full-term neonates. Young children may be more
      susceptible than adults to the toxic effects of antihistamines.

TI  - Reduction of side-effects from ultrarush immunotherapy with honeybee venom by
      pretreatment with fexofenadine: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 484-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with Hymenoptera venoms is highly effective but causes 
      allergic side-effects frequently, especially when honeybee venom is used.
      Therefore, our objective was to investigate the effect of pretreatment with the
      antihistamine fexofenadine on the incidence of allergic side-effects during
      ultrarush immunotherapy with bee venom. METHODS: In a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial, 57 patients with a history of systemic allergic
      reactions to honeybee stings and positive diagnostic tests (skin tests, serum
      specific IgE to honeybee venom) were investigated. Bee venom immunotherapy was
      started with an ultrarush protocol and patients were randomized to pretreatment
      with either fexofenadine 180 mg or placebo on days 1, 8, 22, and 50 of the
      protocol. Local and systemic allergic side-effects were registered. RESULTS:
      Fifty-four patients completed the study, 28 on fexofenadine and 26 on placebo
      pretreatment. On day 1, large local reactions were significantly reduced in both 
      extension and duration by fexofenadine pretreatment (P<0.025). Systemic allergic 
      side-effects on the whole were not reduced. However, the symptoms pruritus,
      urticaria, and angioedema occurred less frequently with fexofenadine (P<0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with fexofenadine during venom immunotherapy reduces
      local allergic reactions and generalized symptoms of the urticaria and angioedema
      type.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the novel H1-receptor antagonist
      emedastine in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 837-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Emedastine is a novel H1-receptor antagonist with pre-clinically
      well-documented anti-allergic effects. Here, we set out to study the relationship
      between emedastine pharmacokinetics and the suppressive effect on
      histamine-induced wheals and flares, and to compare these effects to placebo and 
      cetirizine. METHODS: Emedastine (4 mg q.d.), emedastine (2 mg b.i.d.), cetirizine
      (10 mg q.d.) and placebo were administered to healthy volunteers in a
      double-blind, cross-over fashion. On day 1 and day 5 (steady state) following
      drug administration, wheals and flares were induced by skin-prick testing with 1 
      mg ml(-1) or 10 mg ml(-1) histamine. RESULTS: Following the administration of 4
      mg emedastine q.d., mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)0-24 values
      of 34.49 +/- 24.07 ng h ml(-1) and 47.05 +/- 36.12 ng h ml(-1) were attained on
      day 1 and day 5, respectively. Following the administration of emedastine (2 mg
      b.i.d.) mean AUC0-24 values were 29.75 +/- 19.92 ng h ml(-1) and 46.13 +/- 38.50 
      ng h ml(-1) on day 1 and day 5, respectively. Histamine-induced wheals and flares
      were significantly more effectively suppressed by emedastine and cetirizine than 
      placebo. At pharmacokinetic steady-state levels, no significant difference could 
      be found in the potency between cetirizine and emedastine (2 mg b.i.d.).
      CONCLUSION: Emedastine displays pharmacodynamic properties comparable with
      cetirizine and therefore qualifies as a safe and alternative compound with
      H1-receptor antagonist properties. Additional larger studies may be needed to
      substantiate potential benefits of cetirizine over emedastine after single-dose
      administration.

TI  - Montelukast: a review of its therapeutic potential in persistent asthma.
PG  - 891-928
AB  - Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist used to treat
      persistent asthma in patients aged > or = 6 years. The drug has a rapid onset of 
      action. Improvements in lung function and reductions in as-needed beta2-agonist
      usage are apparent within 1 day of initiating montelukast treatment in adults and
      adolescents (aged > or = 15 years treated with 10 mg/day) or children (aged 6 to 
      14 years treated with 5 mg/day) with persistent asthma as shown in clinical
      trials. In two 12-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind studies in adults
      and adolescents aged > or = 15 years with persistent asthma [forced expiratory
      volume in 1 second (FEV1) = 50 to 85% predicted] there was significantly (p <
      0.05) greater improvement in FEV1, symptom scores, peak expiratory flow (PEF),
      as-needed beta2-agonist use, peripheral eosinophil counts and health-related
      quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with montelukast 10 mg/day than in
      recipients of placebo. Improvements were significantly greater in patients
      treated with inhaled beclomethasone 400 microg/day than in recipients of
      montelukast 10 mg/day in 1 of these studies. Nonetheless, 42% of montelukast
      recipients experienced > or = 11% improvement in FEV1, the median improvement in 
      this parameter in beclomethasone-treated patients. In an 8-week multicentre,
      randomised, double-blind, study in children aged 6 to 14 years with persistent
      asthma (FEV1 50 to 85% predicted), montelukast 5 mg/day produced significantly
      greater improvements in FEV1, clinic PEF, as-needed beta2-agonist use, peripheral
      eosinophil counts, asthma exacerbations and QOL scores than placebo. The
      combination of montelukast 10 mg/day plus inhaled beclomethasone 200 microg twice
      daily provided significantly better asthma control than inhaled beclomethasone
      200 microg twice daily in adults with poorly controlled asthma (mean FEV1 = 72%
      predicted) despite 4 weeks treatment with inhaled beclomethasone. Patients
      receiving the combination experienced significant improvements in FEV1 and
      morning PEF, significant reductions in daytime symptom scores, as-needed beta2
      agonist usage and night-time awakenings with asthma, and had significantly lower 
      peripheral blood eosinophil counts after 16 weeks in this multicentre,
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Among adults (FEV1 > or =
      70%) treated with montelukast 10 mg/day for 12 weeks, inhaled corticosteroid
      dosages were titrated downward by 47% (vs 30% in placebo recipients), 40% of
      patients were tapered off of inhaled corticosteroids (vs 29%), and significantly 
      fewer patients (16 vs 30%) experienced failed corticosteroid rescues in a
      multicentre, randomised, double-blind study. During clinical studies, the
      frequency of adverse events in montelukast-treated adults, adolescents and
      children was similar to that in placebo recipients. In conclusion, montelukast is
      well tolerated and effective in adults and children aged > or = 6 years with
      persistent asthma including those with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction
      and/or aspirin sensitivity. Furthermore, montelukast has glucocorticoid sparing
      properties. Hence, montelukast, as monotherapy in patients with mild persistent
      asthma, or as an adjunct to inhaled corticosteroids is useful across a broad
      spectrum of patients with persistent asthma.

TI  - Loratadine/pseudoephedrine for nasal symptoms in seasonal allergic rhinitis: a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 254, 257-8, 260 passim
AB  - In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, parallel study, we treated
      20 adults who had seasonal allergic rhinitis with once-daily fixed-combination
      loratadine/pseudoephedrine sulfate to observe its effect on relieving symptoms,
      primarily nasal congestion. Acoustic rhinometry detected a trend toward
      improvement in nasal patency, although the difference between pre- and
      post-treatment measures was not statistically significant. Endoscopic inferior
      turbinate photography documented that treatment led to statistically significant 
      reductions in the amount of nasal edema and nasal secretions. The results of a
      quality-of-life questionnaire suggested that treatment alleviated nasal and
      ocular symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis. An analysis of subjective visual analog
      scale scores showed a trend toward improvement in most but not all nasal
      symptoms. We conclude that once-a-day fixed-combination
      loratadine/pseudoephedrine is effective in relieving nasal congestion in patients
      with seasonal allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Sedation with "non-sedating" antihistamines: four prescription-event monitoring
      studies in general practice.
PG  - 1184-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency with which sedation was reported in
      post-marketing surveillance studies of four second generation antihistamines:
      loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, and acrivastine. DESIGN: Prescription-event
      monitoring studies. SETTING: Prescriptions were obtained for each cohort in the
      immediate post-marketing period. SUBJECTS: Event data were obtained for a total
      of 43 363 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reporting of sedation or drowsiness.
      RESULTS: The odds ratios (adjusted for age and sex) for the incidence of sedation
      were 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 1.11; P=0.1) for fexofenadine; 2.79
      (1.69 to 4.58; P<0.0001) for acrivastine, and 3.53 (2.07 to 5.42; P<0.0001) for
      cetirizine compared with loratadine. No increased risk of accident or injury was 
      evident with any of the four drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of sedation
      was low with all four drugs, fexofenadine and loratadine may be more appropriate 
      for people working in safety critical jobs.

TI  - House-dust-mite sublingual-swallow immunotherapy (SLIT) in perennial rhinitis: a 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 369-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of sublingual-swallow immunotherapy (SLIT) in
      rhinitis caused by house-dust mite were evaluated in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study including 75 patients for 24 months. METHODS: Patients
      received either placebo or SLIT with a standardized Dermatophagoides
      pteronyssinus (D.pt.) - D. farinae (D.f) 50/50 extract. The mean cumulative dose 
      was 90,000 IR, equivalent to 2.2 mg of Der p 1 and 1.7 mg of Der f I. Symptom and
      medication scores were assessed throughout the study. Exposure to house-dust
      mite, skin sensitivity, and serum specific IgE and IgG4 were assessed before
      starting treatment and after 12 and 24 months. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients (36 
      active-36 placebo) were eligible for intent-to-treat analysis. Thirty-six
      patients dropped out of the study. The number of patients who dropped out due to 
      lack of efficacy was eight out of 37 (21.6%) in the active treatment group
      compared to 15 out of 38 (39.5%) in the placebo group (chi-square=2.81, P=0.09). 
      Total symptom and medication scores decreased significantly after 12 and 24
      months (P<0.05) of treatment in both groups, but no significant difference was
      observed between the active and placebo groups. After 24 months, the number of
      patients with high levels of indoor allergenic load decreased significantly in
      both groups compared to baseline data (P=0.01). Specific IgE (D.pt. and D.f.)
      increased significantly in the active treatment group after 12 and 24 months,
      while no change was observed in the placebo group. Specific IgG4 levels were not 
      significantly modified in either group. Two patients in each group reported mild 
      adverse effects. No severe adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that SLIT in rhinitis caused by house-dust mite was safe, but there was 
      a lack of consistent clinical benefit compared to placebo, probably due to the
      impact of the allergen avoidance measures that lowered the allergen burden.

TI  - Cetirizine inhibits bradykinin-induced cutaneous wheal and flare in atopic and
      healthy subjects.
PG  - 382-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kinins are vasoactive mediators involved in allergic reactions. When 
      applied on the skin or in the nose, bradykinin (BK) elicits inflammation that is 
      poorly affected by previous H1-blockade. The aim of this study was to compare the
      possible effect of cetirizine (an H1-antagonist) on wheal and flare responses to 
      BK, histamine, and compound 48/80 in atopic and healthy subjects. METHODS: In a
      randomized, double-blind, crossover study, eight atopic and eight healthy
      subjects received cetirizine (10 mg/day) or placebo for 3 days before cutaneous
      tests. Intradermal tests (IDT) and prick tests (PT) were performed with BK (20
      nmol/ml for IDT and 20 micromol/ml for PT), histamine (100 microg/ml IDT and 100 
      mg/ml PT), and compound 48/80 (100 microg/ml IDT and 100 mg/ml PT) as positive
      controls and saline as negative control. The skin responses were monitored by
      measurement of wheal and flare areas. RESULTS: BK, histamine, and 48/80 induced
      wheal and flare reactions in all placebo-treated subjects. Histamine elicited
      larger wheal and flare reactions than BK and 48/80. IDT with BK induced four- to 
      sixfold larger wheal and flare reaction than PT. No differences in BK-induced
      wheal and flare were observed between atopic and healthy subjects. In atopic
      subjects, cetirizine induced a significant reduction of flare reactions after the
      BK test (80% for IDT, and 94% for PT [P < 0.01]). Moreover, cetirizine reduced
      significantly BK-induced wheals by 70% for IDT (P < 0.01) and 65% for PT (P <
      0.01). A similar inhibiting effect of cetirizine was also observed in healthy
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that the wheal and flare reactions
      induced by BK challenge were markedly inhibited by previous intake of cetirizine.
      The mechanism by which this effect is mediated cannot be established at present.

      allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 20-3
AB  - The aim of this double-blind study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
      cetirizine and loratadine versus placebo in patients with allergic rhinitis. The 
      study included a total of 90 patients suffering from moderate to severe allergic 
      rhinitis as determined by a symptom score, with hypersensitivity to house mites
      and with high IgE. The study lasted 7 weeks, including 1 for pretreatment, 4 for 
      treatment and 2 posttreatment (washout). During the study, each patient received 
      either one tablet of placebo, 10 mg of cetirizine or 10 mg of loratadine daily.
      The evaluation was carried out by rhinomanometry to analyze the symptoms on days 
      1, 15, 29 and 43. The nasal cytology was analyzed on days 1 and 29. For
      statistical analysis we used the Mantel-Haenszel method and chi-square test. We
      found that antihistamines showed good effectiveness in improving the
      symptomatology in patients with allergic rhinitis. The improvement by
      rhinomanometry and by symptom score versus placebo was good. It was concluded
      that both antihistamines were significantly superior to placebo and that
      cetirizine performed better in comparison to loratadine versus placebo, although 
      not as statistically significant.

TI  - Modification of antihistaminic activity of cetirizine by nimesulide.
PG  - 389-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of nimesulide (4-nitro-2-phenoxymethane
      sulfonanilide) a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, on antihistaminic activity
      of cetirizine. METHOD: A randomized, double blind, cross over study was conducted
      in ten healthy male volunteers. Wheal and flare responses to histamine were
      measured by performing intradermal injection of histamine (2 micrograms base)
      diluted in 100 microliters volume of saline on the volar surface of forearm, on
      four occasions (0, 2, 4, and 6 hrs. post-dosing). Each volunteer was randomized
      to receive either treatment A (cetirizine 10 mg + placebo) or treatment B
      (cetirizine 100 mg + nimesulide 100 mg), with one week wash out period in between
      each administration. Wheal and flare responses were measured ten minutes after
      each histamine injection. RESULTS: Both cetirizine 10 mg alone and cetirizine 10 
      mg + nimesulide 100 mg, decreased wheal and flare responses significantly at 2
      hrs. and this continued till 6 hrs. post-dosing. This decrease was highly
      significant when cetirizine was given along with nimesulide. CONCLUSION: The
      results suggest a synergistic effect exhibited by the combined use of cetirizine 
      with nimesulide.

TI  - Comparative therapeutic effect and safety of mizolastine and loratadine in
      chronic idiopathic urticaria. URTILOR study group.
PG  - 205-11
AB  - Mizolastine, a new second-generation H1 receptor antagonist with additional
      anti-allergic properties, was compared with loratadine in 61 patients suffering
      from severe chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). In this double-blind study,
      patients were randomly allocated to receive either mizolastine 10 mg (n = 26) or 
      loratadine 10 mg (n = 35) once-daily for 28 days. Both compounds were well
      tolerated, safe and efficacious. The reduction in the number of episodes per week
      (5. 6+/-16.3 and 6.4+/-12.4 for mizolastine and loratadine, respectively) and the
      reduction in the symptom severity score, measured using a Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS), were comparable (30.2 +/- 39.0 mm and 30.5 +/- 28.5 mm for mizolastine and
      loratadine, respectively). Mizolastine had a positive effect on angioedema (85%
      CI 95% [0.69-1.00]) of patients improved compared with 75% (CI 95% [0.59-0.91])
      of the loratadine group and the differential reduction of the mean total duration
      of episodes in the mizolastine group was higher when compared with the loratadine
      group (from 13.7 +/- 33.5 hours on day 0 to 5.1 +/- 9.0 hours over the treatment 
      period and from 8.2 +/- 8.8 hours on day 0 to 5.1 +/- 7.8 hours over the
      treatment period for mizolastine and loratadine, respectively). Prick test
      analysis demonstrated that both drugs caused a significant decrease of
      histamine-induced wheal and flare with no development of tolerance, with a
      significant superiority of mizolastine over loratadine for some histamine
      concentrations. Mizolastine and loratadine both proved very efficacious and safe.
      In addition mizolastine demonstrated a superiority in prick tests, beneficial
      effects on angioedema and seemed to provide a faster onset of action.

TI  - Effects of fexofenadine, diphenhydramine, and alcohol on driving performance. A
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial in the Iowa driving simulator.
PG  - 354-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sedating antihistamines may impair driving performance as seriously
      as alcohol. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of fexofenadine, diphenhydramine,
      alcohol, and placebo on driving performance. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind,
      double-dummy, four-treatment, four-period crossover trial. SETTING: The Iowa
      Driving Simulator. PARTICIPANTS: 40 licensed drivers with seasonal allergic
      rhinitis who were 25 to 44 years of age. INTERVENTION: One dose of fexofenadine
      (60 mg), diphenhydramine (50 mg), alcohol (approximately 0.1% blood alcohol
      concentration), or placebo, given at weekly intervals before participants drove
      for 1 hour in the Iowa Driving Simulator. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was
      coherence, a continuous measure of participants' ability to match the varying
      speed of a vehicle that they were following. Secondary end points were drowsiness
      and other driving measures, including lane keeping and response to a vehicle that
      unexpectedly blocked the lane ahead. RESULTS: Participants had significantly
      better coherence after taking alcohol or fexofenadine than after taking
      diphenhydramine. Lane keeping (steering instability and crossing the center line)
      was impaired after alcohol and diphenhydramine use compared with fexofenadine
      use. Mean response time to the blocking vehicle was slowest after alcohol use
      (2.21 seconds) compared with fexofenadine use (1.95 seconds). Self-reported
      drowsiness did not predict lack of coherence and was weakly associated with
      minimum following distance, steering instability, and leftlane excursion.
      CONCLUSIONS: Participants had similar performance when treated with fexofenadine 
      or placebo. After alcohol use, participants performed the primary task well but
      not the secondary tasks; as a result, overall driving performance was poorer.
      After participants took diphenhydramine, driving performance was poorest,
      indicating that diphenhydramine had a greater impact on driving than alcohol did.
      Drowsiness ratings were not a good predictor of impairment, suggesting that
      drivers cannot use drowsiness to indicate when they should not drive.

TI  - An evidence-based review of the efficacy of antihistamines in relieving pruritus 
      in atopic dermatitis.
PG  - 1522-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To critically review the body of clinical trials that refute or
      support the efficacy of antihistamines in relieving pruritus in patients with
      atopic dermatitis. DESIGN: Review of MEDLINE from 1966 through March 1999, the
      Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Best Evidence to identify
      therapeutic trials of antihistamines in patients with atopic dermatitis. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: All randomized controlled trials or clinical trials of
      antihistamines used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. We found 16 studies
      throughout the literature. RESULTS: Large, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trials with definitive conclusions (grade A trials)
      have not been performed. Two grade B trials (small, rigorous, randomized trials
      with uncertain results due to moderate to high alpha or beta error) refuted the
      use of antihistamines in relieving pruritus. One grade B trial supported the
      efficacy of antihistamines in relieving pruritus. All remaining trials (grade C) 
      lacked placebo controls or randomization, or contained fewer than 20 patients in 
      each treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Although antihistamines are often used in the 
      treatment of atopic dermatitis, little objective evidence exists to demonstrate
      relief of pruritus. The majority of trials are flawed in terms of the sample size
      or study design. Based on the literature alone, the efficacy of antihistamines
      remains to be adequately investigated. Anecdotally, sedating antihistamines have 
      sometimes been useful by virtue of their soporific effect and bedtime use may be 
      warranted. There is no evidence to support the effectiveness of expensive
      nonsedating agents.

PG  - 589-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the consistency and efficacy of the two antihistamines,
      cetirizine (10 mg) and ebastine (20 mg) on histamine skin reactivity 4 h after
      treatment. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers participated in a randomised
      double-blind cross-over study. The areas of wheals and flares induced by
      increasing (0, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 300 mg/ml) histamine concentrations,
      administered by prick tests, were measured before and 4 h after intake of
      cetirizine or ebastine. RESULTS: Before treatment, concentration-response curves 
      were similar and threshold concentrations identical (0.57 mg/ml and 0.57 mg/ml
      for cetirizine and ebastine, respectively). Both treatments exerted a significant
      effect. However, cetirizine was significantly more efficient than ebastine 20 mg 
      (P < 0.01 both for wheals and flares). After cetirizine, the threshold
      concentration inducing a 3-mm(2 )wheal was significantly higher (266 mg/ml) than 
      after ebastine (77 mg/ml) (P < 0.01), and total inhibition of the wheal was
      obtained in 18 of 24 patients for cetirizine and in 4 of 24 for ebastine (P <
      0.001). The variation coefficient for the wheal reaction was 31% for cetirizine
      and 159% for ebastine, indicating a much lower variability after cetirizine.
      CONCLUSION: Our study shows clearly that the efficacy of a single therapeutic
      dosage of cetirizine is greater and consistently better than that of ebastine for
      suppression of cutaneous reactivity to histamine 4 h after treatment in healthy
      volunteers. The need for ebastine to metabolise into the active carebastine might
      explain this difference.

TI  - A prospective evaluation of esophageal testing and a double-blind, randomized
      study of omeprazole in a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for chronic cough.
PG  - 3131-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggest an association between chronic cough and
      gastroesophageal reflux. Our study aims were 1) to define the prevalence of acid 
      reflux induced cough in the general community, 2) to examine the ability of
      esophageal testing to identify gastroesophageal reflux related cough, and 3) to
      assess the utility of omeprazole in a chronic cough algorithm. METHODS: Patients 
      with chronic cough of unknown etiology, who were mostly from the community, were 
      evaluated. Subjects underwent a chest x-ray, methacholine challenge test, and
      empiric trial of postnasal drip therapy, and completed daily cough symptom
      diaries subjectively evaluating cough frequency and severity on a graded scale of
      0-4 (combined maximum 8). After excluding other causes of cough, the remaining
      patients underwent esophageal and pH testing. Those testing positive were
      randomized to omeprazole 40 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 12 weeks. Follow-up was 1
      yr. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were screened; 48 were excluded. Twenty-three
      patients were evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux disease; six (26%) were
      eventually determined to have an acid-related cough. Of these patients, 17 had a 
      positive pH test, six (35%) of whom showed a striking improvement or resolution
      of their cough during omeprazole treatment which was sustained for up to 1 yr.
      Six had a negative pH test, none of whom responded to omeprazole therapy. No
      significant differences were seen between responders (n = 6) and nonresponders (n
      = 11) for demographic factors, baseline symptom frequency and duration, or
      physiological parameters (motility/pH). CONCLUSIONS: Acid-related chronic cough
      was present in 26% (six of 23) of patients evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux 
      disease. Esophageal testing does not reliably identify patients with acid induced
      chronic cough responsive to proton pump inhibitor therapy. We suggest that the
      best diagnostic and therapeutic approach, after excluding asthma and postnasal
      drip syndrome, is empiric treatment for 2 wk with a high dose proton pump
      inhibitor.

TI  - Fexofenadine: new preparation. Terfenadine, without cardiotoxicity.
PG  - 11-3
AB  - (1) Fexofenadine, a non anticholinergic non sedative antihistamine, is available 
      in France for oral treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. (2)
      Fexofenadine is actually an active metabolite of terfenadine, a drug taken off
      the market because of its cardiotoxicity. (3) In seasonal allergic rhinitis a
      comparative trial showed that the effect of fexofenadine (120 mg/day in a single 
      intake) was moderate and not different from that of cetirizine. (4) In chronic
      urticaria a dose-finding study showed that the optimal oral dose of fexofenadine 
      was 180 mg/day. The lack of comparative trials means that the efficacy of
      fexofenadine in relation to other antihistamines is not known. (5) Fexofenadine
      seems to be well tolerated. Animal studies and limited clinical experience have
      failed to detect any cardiotoxicity.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of troglitazone.
PG  - 91-104
AB  - Troglitazone is a new thiazolidinedione oral antidiabetic agent approved for use 
      to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is rapidly
      absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of between 40 and 50%. Food increases
      the absorption by 30 to 80%. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are linear over
      the clinical dosage range of 200 to 600 mg once daily. The mean elimination
      half-life ranges from 7.6 to 24 hours, which facilitates a once daily
      administration regimen. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are similar between 
      patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy individuals. In humans, troglitazone
      undergoes metabolism by sulfation, glucuronidation and oxidation to form a
      sulfate conjugate (M1), glucuronide conjugate (M2) and quinone metabolite (M3),
      respectively. M1 and M3 are the major metabolites in plasma, and M2 is a minor
      metabolite. Age, gender, type 2 diabetes, renal impairment, smoking and race do
      not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of troglitazone and its 2 major
      metabolites. In patients with hepatic impairment the plasma concentrations of
      troglitazone, M1 and M3 increase by 30%, 4-fold, and 2-fold, respectively.
      Cholestyramine decreases the absorption of troglitazone by 70%. Troglitazone may 
      enhance the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and/or transporter(s) thereby 
      reducing the plasma concentrations of terfenadine, cyclosporin, atorvastatin and 
      fexofenadine. It also reduces the plasma concentrations of the oral contraceptive
      hormones ethinylestradiol, norethindrone and levonorgestrel. Troglitazone does
      not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, glibenclamide (glyburide) or
      paracetamol (acetaminophen). There is no pharmacodynamic interaction between
      troglitazone and warfarin or alcohol (ethanol). Pharmacodynamic modelling showed 
      that improvement in fasting glucose and triglyceride levels increased with dose
      from 200 to 600 mg. Knowledge of systemic troglitazone exposure within a dose
      group does not improve the prediction of glucose lowering response or adverse
      effects beyond those based on the administered dose.

TI  - Comparison of the response to histamine challenge of the nose and the maxillary
      sinus: effect of loratadine.
PG  - 1038-47
AB  - To study the response of the maxillary sinus to histamine provocation, we
      performed a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial during which nonallergic
      subjects without symptoms of rhinitis (n = 25) received either 10 mg loratadine
      or placebo once daily for a week and then underwent nasal challenge with
      histamine (3, 10, and 30 mg/ml) followed, 24 h later, by a maxillary sinus
      challenge while still receiving the medication. Nasal challenge with histamine
      led to significant increases in vascular permeability, reflex nasal secretions,
      sneezing, and other nasal symptoms. Sinus challenge resulted in significant
      increases in vascular permeability within the sinus cavity (P < 0.01) and some
      nasal symptoms but no significant change in reflex nasal secretions. The response
      of the sinus mucosa to histamine was lower in magnitude than that of the nose.
      Treatment with loratadine resulted in a significant inhibition of the
      histamine-induced changes in both nasal and sinus cavities. Our data suggest the 
      lack of a sinonasal reflex response to histamine provocation of the maxillary
      sinus of nonallergic individuals.

TI  - A double-blind, single-dose, crossover comparison of cetirizine, ebastine,
      epinastine, fexofenadine, terfenadine, and loratadine versus placebo: suppression
      of histamine-induced wheal and flare response for 24 h in healthy male subjects.
PG  - 700-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: New H1-antagonists have become available, but there has been no
      comparison of their potency for inhibiting histamine in the skin. METHODS:
      Cetirizine 10 mg, ebastine 10 mg, epinastine 20 mg, fexofenadine 60 mg,
      terfenadine 60 mg, loratadine 10 mg, or placebo was given to 14 healthy male
      volunteers in a double-blind, crossover randomized manner. Inhibition of the
      wheal and flare response to epicutaneous histamine phosphate (100 mg/ml)
      challenge was measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h after doses.
      RESULTS: Epinastine inhibited the wheal and flare after 30 min. Cetirizine
      commenced acting at 1 h and was superior to other treatments. Ebastine was no
      better than placebo until 4 h, but was efficacious thereafter until 24 h.
      Terfenadine induced potent inhibition after 1 h and was superior to its
      metabolite fexofenadine. Loratadine was the least potent inhibitor. Inhibition of
      the flare response paralleled the patterns seen for wheals. The rank order for
      area under the curve (0-24 h) was cetirizine, epinastine, terfenadine, ebastine, 
      fexofenadine, loratadine, and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of histamine
      effects in the skin may be useful in predicting the clinical utility of newly
      introduced antihistamines in treating allergic disorders.

TI  - Histamine response and local cooling in the human skin: involvement of H1- and
      H2-receptors.
PG  - 216-22
AB  - AIMS: Histamine may contribute locally to cutaneous blood flow control under
      normal and pathologic conditions. The objective of this study was to observe the 
      influence of skin temperature on histamine vasodilation, and the roles of H1-and 
      H2-receptors using novel noninvasive methods. METHODS: Eleven healthy subjects
      received, double-blind, single doses of the H1-receptor antagonist cetirizine (10
      mg), cetirizine (10 mg) plus the H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine (400 mg), or
      placebo on separate occasions. Histamine was dosed cumulatively by iontophoresis 
      to the forearm skin at 34 degrees C and 14 degrees C. Laser-Doppler flux (LDF)
      was measured at the same sites using customised probeholder/iontophoretic
      chambers with Peltier cooling elements. Finger mean arterial pressure (MAP) was
      measured and cutaneous vascular conductance calculated as LDF/MAP. RESULTS:
      Histamine vasodilation was reduced in cold skin. Cetirizine shifted the histamine
      dose-response at both temperatures: statistically significantly at 14 degrees C
      only. Combined H1- and H2-receptor antagonism shifted the response significantly 
      at both temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: H1- and H2-receptors mediate histamine-induced
      skin vasodilation. The sensitivity of these receptors, particularly the H1-
      receptor, is attenuated at low skin temperature. Whether the reduced effect in
      cold skin represents specific receptor or postreceptor desensitization, or
      nonspecific attenuation of cutaneous vasodilation remains to be elucidated.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of the effects of fexofenadine, 
      loratadine and promethazine on cognitive and psychomotor function.
PG  - 200-6
AB  - AIMS: To assess whether fexofenadine in a range of doses from 80 to 180 mg has
      any disruptive effects on aspects of psychomotor and cognitive function in
      comparison with placebo, loratadine and promethazine, an antihistamine known to
      produce psychomotor and cognitive impairment. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy
      volunteers received fexofenadine 80 mg, 120 mg and 180 mg, loratadine 10 mg,
      promethazine 30 mg (as a positive internal control) and placebo in a six-way
      crossover, double-blind study. Following each dose, subjects were required to
      perform a series of tests of cognitive function and psychomotor performance at
      1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h post dose. The test battery included critical flicker
      fusion (CFF), choice reaction time (CRT) and assessment of subjective sedation
      (LARS). Overall levels of activity were monitored by means of wrist mounted
      actigraphs throughout each of the 24 h experimental periods. RESULTS:
      Fexofenadine at all doses tested was not statistically different from placebo in 
      any of the tests used and loratadine did not cause any significant impairment of 
      cognitive function. Significant impairments were found following promethazine.
      Promethazine caused a significant reduction in CFF threshold and this effect was 
      evident up to 12 h post dose (P<0.05). There was a significant increase in
      recognition reaction time at 3 and 6 h post promethazine administration, and the 
      drug caused a significant (P<0. 002) increase in the percentage of 'sleep-like'
      activity from actigraph records during the daytime. CONCLUSIONS: Fexofenadine at 
      doses up to 180 mg appears free from disruptive effects on aspects of psychomotor
      and cognitive function in a study where the psychometric assessments have been
      shown to be sensitive to impairment, as evidenced by the effects of the verum
      control promethazine 30 mg.

TI  - New treatments for allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 1255-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review new treatments for allergic rhinitis. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE:
      Most studies supporting the principles in this paper are double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trials. Good evidence supports use of antihistamines, nasal
      steroid sprays, and immunotherapy. Fewer trials have been done on the new
      antileukotrienes. MAIN MESSAGE: Allergic rhinitis causes significant morbidity,
      which can be successfully treated. Newer antihistamines, developed to replace
      terfenadine and astemizole which have potential side effects, include loratadine,
      cetirizine, and the newest, fexofenadine. Intranasal steroid sprays are also
      effective, particularly for people with nasal stuffiness. One study showed some
      growth retardation in children using beclomethasone over a prolonged period (1
      year). The newer steroid sprays, such as fluticasone, budesonide, and mometasone 
      furoate aqueous, however, have not been studied in the same way and are usually
      recommended for shorter periods. The newest group of medications showing real
      promise are the antileukotrienes, including zafirlukast and montelukast. Taken
      orally, these medications avoid the discomfort of nasal sprays and seem to have
      few side effects. Immunotherapy offers a new option: a short-course, preseasonal 
      series of six to 11 injections that reduces the burden on patients for year-round
      therapy. Combinations of these therapies are also possible. CONCLUSIONS: With new
      medications and immunotherapy options, family physicians can offer effective
      treatment to patients with allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Comparative tolerability of second generation antihistamines.
PG  - 385-401
AB  - Second generation histamine H1 receptor antagonists, the so-called 'nonsedating' 
      antihistamines, have high potency and additional antiallergic properties as well 
      as H1 antagonism and are associated with fewer adverse effects compared with the 
      first generation antihistamines. A number of drugs in this class are approved for
      use: acrivastine, astemizole, azelastine, cetirizine, ebastine, fexofenadine,
      loratadine, mizolastine and terfenadine. All of them have a more favourable
      risk-benefit ratio with regard to the CNS adverse effects. Even those second
      generation antihistamines that are not actually 'nonsedating' are less impairing 
      than their predecessors, but not one of them is entirely devoid of CNS activity. 
      Under certain circumstances some antihistamines may affect cardiac repolarisation
      resulting in cardiovascular adverse effects. Serious cardiovascular effects have 
      been reported with terfenadine and astemizole when they are used in high dosages 
      or when they are given to 'at risk' patients. Animal models indicate that there
      might be a potential risk of cardiovascular adverse effects with other
      antihistamines as well. However, up to now there is no clinical evidence for this
      assumption, despite some confusing reports. Likewise there has been much
      discussion about a link between these agents and carcinogenicity. However, there 
      is no evidence that any of the second generation antihistamines increase the risk
      of tumour growth in humans. Small children, elderly patients and persons with
      chronic renal or liver impairment are special groups in which the individual
      adverse effects of the second generation antihistamines must be kept in mind. The
      dosage for an individual has to be modified with respect to their metabolic
      situation. Despite the fact that some of the second generation antihistamines are
      listed in the US Food and Drug Administration pregnancy risk classification as
      class B, the use of second generation antihistamines should be avoided during
      pregnancy and they should never be administered to nursing mothers. Taking into
      account their negligible CNS activity, the low incidence of cardiovascular
      adverse effects, their lack of anticholinergic effects and other benefits, this
      class of antiallergic drugs represents a definite advance in therapy.

TI  - Cardiovascular safety of fexofenadine HCl.
PG  - 1451-4
AB  - Fexofenadine HCl is the acid metabolite of terfenadine (Seldane). The effect of
      this recently approved nonsedating antihistamine on the corrected QT interval
      (QTc) was evaluated in dose-tolerance, safety, and drug-interaction studies with 
      healthy volunteers, and in clinical studies in patients with seasonal allergic
      rhinitis (SAR). Twelve-lead electrocardiographic data were collected once before 
      and after dosing or serially throughout these studies. Outliers were defined as
      QTc > 440 ms with a > or = 10 ms increase from baseline. The recommended
      fexofenadine HCl dose is 60 mg twice daily. Fexofenadine HCl doses up to 800 mg
      once daily or 690 mg twice daily for 28 days resulted in no dose-related
      increases in QTc. Longer term studies indicated no statistically significant QTc 
      increases compared with placebo in patients receiving fexofenadine HCl 80 mg
      twice daily for 3 months, 60 mg twice daily for 6 months, or 240 mg once daily
      for 12 months. Interaction studies showed no significant increases in QTc when
      fexofenadine HCl 120 mg twice daily was administered in combination with
      erythromycin (500 mg 3 times daily) or ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) after
      dosing to steady state (6.5 days). Clinical trials in patients with SAR (n =
      1,160) treated with 40, 60, 120, or 240 mg twice-daily fexofenadine HCl or
      placebo indicated no dose-related increases in QTc and no statistically
      significant increases in mean QTc compared with placebo. In controlled trials
      with approximately 6,000 persons, no case of fexofenadine-associated torsades de 
      pointes was observed. The frequency and magnitude of QTc outliers were similar
      between fexofenadine HCl and placebo in all studies. Based on a large clinical
      database, we conclude that fexofenadine HCl has no significant effect on QTc,
      even at doses > 10-fold higher than that is efficacious for SAR.

TI  - Variations among non-sedating antihistamines: are there real differences?
PG  - 85-93
AB  - Most of the modern non-sedating H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines)
      penetrate the brain poorly, allowing the use of doses large enough to counteract 
      allergic processes in peripheral tissues without important central effects. The
      antihistamines reviewed here are acrivastine, astemizole, cetirizine, ebastine,
      fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine, and terfenadine. However, these drugs are 
      not entirely free from central effects, and there are at least quantitative
      differences between them. Although psychomotor and sleep studies in healthy
      subjects in the laboratory may predict that an antihistamine does not cause
      drowsiness, the safety margin can be narrow enough to cause a central sedating
      effect during actual treatment. This might result from a patient's individual
      sensitivity, disease-induced sedation, or drug dosages that are for various
      reasons relatively or absolutely larger (patient's weight, poor response, reduced
      drug clearance, interactions). Mild to even moderate sedation is not necessarily 
      a major nuisance, particularly if stimulants need be added to the regimen (e.g.
      in perennial rhinitis). Furthermore, patients can adjust doses themselves if
      needed. Sedating antihistamines are not needed for long-term itching, because
      glucocorticoids are indicated and more effective. It is wise to restrict or avoid
      using antihistamines (astemizole, terfenadine) that can cause cardiac
      dysrhythmias, because even severe cardiotoxicity can occur in certain
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Histamine H1 receptor antagonists
      (antihistamines) are used in the treatment of allergic disorders. The therapeutic
      effects of most of the older antihistamines were associated with sedating effects
      on the central nervous system (CNS) and antimuscarinic effects causing dry mouth 
      and blurred vision. Non-specific "quinidine-like" or local anaesthetic actions
      often led to cardiotoxicity in animals and man. Although such adverse effects
      varied from drug to drug, there was some degree of sedation with all old
      antihistamines. Non-sedating antihistamines have become available during the past
      15 years. Some of them also have antiserotonin or other actions that oppose
      allergic inflammation, and they are not entirely free from sedative effects
      either. In small to moderate "clinical" concentrations they are competitive H1
      receptor antagonists, although large concentrations of some of them exert
      non-competitive blockade. Daytime drowsiness and weakness are seldom really
      important, and they restrict patients' activities less than the old
      antihistamines. Some new antihistamines share with old antihistamines
      quinidine-like effects on the cardiac conducting tissues, and clinically
      significant interactions have raised the question of drug safety. This
      prodysrhythmic effect has also been briefly mentioned in comparisons of
      non-sedative H1 antihistamines.

TI  - Treating allergic rhinitis in pregnancy. Safety considerations.
PG  - 361-75
AB  - Allergic rhinitis affects approximately one-third of women of childbearing age.
      As a result, symptoms ranging from sneezing and itching to severe nasal
      obstruction may require pharmacotherapy. However, product labels state that
      medications for allergic rhinitis should be avoided during pregnancy due to lack 
      of fetal safety data, even though the majority of the agents have human data
      which refute these notions. We present a systematic and critical review of the
      medical literature on the use of pharmacotherapy for the management of allergic
      rhinitis during pregnancy. Electronic databases and other literature sources were
      searched to identify observational controlled studies focusing on the rate of
      fetal malformations in pregnant women exposed to agents used to treat allergic
      rhinitis and related diseases compared with controls. Immunotherapy and
      intranasal sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn) and beclo-methasone would be considered
      as first-line therapy, both because of their lack of association with congenital 
      abnormalities and their superior efficacy to other agents. First-generation (e.g.
      chlorpheniramine) and second-generation (e.g. cetirizine) antihistamines have not
      been incriminated as human teratogens. However, first-generation antihistamines
      are favoured over their second generation counterparts based on their longevity, 
      leading to more conclusive evidence of safety. There are no controlled trials
      with loratadine and fexofenadine in human pregnancy. Oral, intranasal and
      ophthalmic decongestants (e.g. pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine and oxymetazoline, 
      respectively) should be considered as second-line therapy, although further
      studies are needed to clarify their fetal safety. No human reproductive studies
      have been reported with the ophthalmic antihistamines ketorolac and
      levocabastine, although preliminary data reported suggest no association between 
      pheniramine and congenital malformations. There are no documented epidemiological
      studies with intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. budesonide, fluticasone propionate,
      mometasone) during pregnancy; however, inhaled corticosteroids (e.g.
      beclomethasone) have not been incriminated as teratogens and are commonly used by
      pregnant women who have asthma. In summary, women with allergic rhinitis during
      pregnancy can be treated with a number of pharmacological agents without concern 
      of untoward effects on their unborn child. Although the choice of agents in part 
      should be based on evidence of fetal safety, issue of efficacy needs to be
      addressed in order to optimally manage this condition.

TI  - Risk of ventricular arrhythmias associated with nonsedating antihistamine drugs.
PG  - 307-13
AB  - AIMS: To quantify and compare the incidence of ventricular arrhythniias
      associated with the use of five nonsedating antihistamines: acrivastine,
      astemizole, cetirizine, loratadine and terfenadine. The effects of age, sex,
      dose, duration of treatment, and the interaction with P450 inhibitor drugs were
      also examined. METHODS: We carried out a cohort study with a nested case-control 
      analysis using the UK-based General Practice Research database (GPRD). The study 
      cohort included persons aged less than 80 years old who received their first
      prescription for any of the five study drugs between January 1, 1992 and
      September 30, 1996. We estimated relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of
      idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias with current use of antihistamines as compared
      with non use. RESULTS: The study cohort included 197425 persons who received
      513012 prescriptions. Over the study period 18 valid cases of idiopathic
      ventricular arrhythmias were detected. Nine occurred during the current use of
      any antihistamine, resulting in a crude incidence of 1.9 per 10000 person-years
      (95%CI: 1.0-3.6) and a relative risk of 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5-11.8) as compared with
      non use. Astemizole presented the highest relative risk (RR= 19.0; 95%CI:
      4.8-76.0) of all study drugs, while terfenadine (RR=2.1; 95%CI:0.5-8.5) was in
      the range of other nonsedating antihistamines. Older age was associated with a
      greater risk of ventricular arrhythmias (RR=7.4; 95%CI: 2.6-21.4) and seemed to
      increase the effect of antihistamines (RR=6.4; 95%CI: 1.7-24.8). The proportions 
      of high dose terfenadine and the concomitant use with P450 inhibitors among
      current users of terfenadine were 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively over the study
      period with no single case of ventricular arrhythmias occurring in the presence
      of these two risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The use of nonsedating antihistamines
      increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias by a factor of four in the general 
      population. Yet, the absolute effect is quite low requiring 57000 prescriptions, 
      or 5300 person-years of use for one case to occur. The risk associated with
      terfenadine was no different from that with other nonsedating antihistamines.

TI  - Administration of acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide to atopic
      eczema patients.
PG  - 39-45
AB  - Responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were
      investigated in atopic eczema (AE) patients. To elucidate the involvement of
      histamine to ACh-provoked vasoreactions and sensations, we applied a selective
      H1-antagonist (cetirizine) 3 h prior to the ACh-administration. Solutions of
      acetylcholine (ACh, 0.55 M) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP, 1.5x
      10(-5) M) were injected (10 microl) intracutaneously into the volar forearm of 14
      healthy subjects and 14 atopic eczema (AE) patients. The substances were applied 
      as single stimulus as well as in combination. Sensations evoked by the
      stimulation were recorded using 2 visual analog scales (VAS). Vasoreactions were 
      analyzed with the new technique of computer assisted video image analysis. With
      this method we measured the dynamics of the flare development and the extension
      of the final flare size independent of the observer's assessment. In control
      subjects the development and extension of the final flare size was almost
      similar, regardless whether ACh and VIP were applied in combination or
      separately. Compared to healthy controls, after injection of ACh, VIP and the
      combination of VIP and ACh smaller flare sizes were recorded in AE patients.
      After VIP was given, the control subjects reported pruritus, which was
      significantly augmented compared to AE patients. In contrast, controls reported a
      burning pain after the injection of ACh, whereas AE patients felt predominantly
      pruritus. Itch sensation after the combined application of VIP and ACh was
      significantly elevated in AE patients. Consequently, we assume that mediators of 
      sudomotor neurons, i.e., VIP and ACh meet in AE patients apparently sensitized
      nociceptive primary afferents and induce exaggerated itch, pain and flare
      responses. When pretreated with the selective H1-antagonist cetirizine before ACh
      was injected, pain and erythema due to ACh was diminished in healthy controls. In
      contrast, cetirizine did not influence the size of erythema and the magnitude of 
      sensation in AE patients. We conclude, that the release of histamine is not
      involved in ACh-induced erythema and pruritus in AE. These data provide evidence 
      that pruritus can be elicited in atopic eczema by a cholinergic, histamine
      independent mechanism.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of Claritin-D 
      24 Hour (once daily) with that of Claritin-D 12 Hour (twice daily) and placebo in
      the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). In this
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, 469 patients with
      moderate-to-severe SAR symptoms were treated for 2 weeks with one of the
      following: Claritin-D 24 Hour (a combination tablet formulation of loratadine 10 
      mg in the coating and pseudoephedrine sulfate 240 mg in an extended-release
      core), Claritin-D 12 Hour (a combination tablet formulation of loratadine 5 mg in
      the tablet coating and 120 mg pseudoephedrine sulfate, 60 mg in the coating and
      60 mg in the core), or placebo. Claritin-D 24 Hour and Claritin-D 12 Hour were
      consistently superior to placebo (P < 0.01) in reducing total, nasal, and
      nonnasal symptom scores. Patients in the Claritin-D 24 Hour and Claritin-D 12
      Hour groups also had significantly greater (P </= 0.05) relief of rhinorrhea and 
      nasal stuffiness as compared with placebo. Insomnia was reported significantly
      more often (P < 0.01) in Claritin-D 12 Hour (15%) patients compared with
      Claritin-D 24 Hour (4%) and placebo (2%) patients. Dry mouth was reported
      significantly more often (P < 0.05) in Claritin-D 24 Hour (13%) and Claritin-D 12
      Hour (13%) groups compared with placebo (4%). Claritin-D 24 Hour has efficacy
      comparable to Claritin-D 12 Hour in relieving allergic rhinitis symptoms while
      producing significantly less insomnia.

TI  - Nasal effect of cetirizine and loratadine at 24 hours in patients with allergic
      rhinitis.
PG  - 307-11
AB  - Numerous studies have compared the duration of the cutaneous effect of cetirizine
      and loratadine. We assessed their nasal effects 24 hours after administration in 
      patients with allergic rhinitis, using a randomized, double-blind, crossover,
      placebo-controlled trial. Nasal challenge was performed by nebulization of
      increasing doubling dosages of histamine (0.04-1.28 mg/nostril) in 12 patients
      (seven males, five females, aged 31 +/- 7 years). Nasal airway resistance was
      measured by posterior rhinomanometry 24 hours after intake of cetirizine (10 mg),
      loratadine (10 mg), or placebo. Baseline nasal airway resistance was identical on
      all study days (2.86 +/- 0.10 cm H2 O/L per second). Twenty-four hours after
      intake, the dose-response curve of nasal obstruction to histamine was
      significantly lower after treatment with cetirizine compared with placebo (P <
      0.05). However, although the curve was lower on loratadine than on placebo, the
      curves did not differ significantly. In conclusion, our study shows significant
      efficacy of cetirizine, but not of loratadine, in the nose at 24 hours after a
      single dose. This suggests that the nasal action of cetirizine is longer lasting 
      than that of loratadine in patients with allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Docetaxel (Taxotere) plus cisplatin: an active and well-tolerated combination in 
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 2032-6
AB  - The activity of the combination of intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 
      100 mg/m2 administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles then every 6 weeks was
      investigated in 51 chemotherapy naive patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The population was 92% male, with 
      a median age of 54 years and median performance status of 1; 80% of patients had 
      metastatic disease, including 37% with bone involvement. All patients received
      prophylactic premedication (ondansetron, dexamethasone plus cetirizine) and
      standard hyperhydration. With a median of 4 treatment cycles (range 1-9), 14 of
      42 evaluable patients responded (overall response rate 33.3%, 95% CI 19.6-49.6%);
      the median response duration was 7.3 months, median survival 8.4 months, and
      1-year survival rate 35%. The most common adverse event was neutropenia,
      occurring in two-thirds of patients. Neurosensory effects were cumulative but
      generally mild. No treatment-related deaths occurred. This combination of
      docetaxel/cisplatin showed activity in advanced NSCLC. While it was not clearly
      superior to single-agent docetaxel, due to differences in prognostic factors
      among the patients in open trials, a randomised study would be needed to
      demonstrate definitively whether cisplatin adds to the activity of docetaxel or
      not.

TI  - Second-generation antihistamines: a comparative review.
PG  - 31-47
AB  - Second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) have been
      developed to reduce or eliminate the sedation and anticholinergic adverse effects
      that occur with older H1 receptor antagonists. This article evaluates
      second-generation antihistamines, including acrivastine, astemizole, azelastine, 
      cetirizine, ebastine, fexofenadine, ketotifen, loratadine, mizolastine and
      terfenadine, for significant features that affect choice. In addition to their
      primary mechanism of antagonising histamine at the H1 receptor, these agents may 
      act on other mediators of the allergic reaction. However, the clinical
      significance of activity beyond that mediated by histamine H1 receptor antagonism
      has yet to be demonstrated. Most of the agents reviewed are metabolised by the
      liver to active metabolites that play a significant role in their effect.
      Conditions that result in accumulation of astemizole, ebastine and terfenadine
      may prolong the QT interval and result in torsade de pointes. The remaining
      agents reviewed do not appear to have this risk. For allergic rhinitis, all
      agents are effective and the choice should be based on other factors. For
      urticaria, cetirizine and mizolastine demonstrate superior suppression of wheal
      and flare at the dosages recommended by the manufacturer. For atopic dermatitis, 
      as adjunctive therapy to reduce pruritus, cetirizine, ketotifen and loratadine
      demonstrate efficacy. Although current evidence does not suggest a primary role
      for these agents in the management of asthma, it does support their use for
      asthmatic patients when there is coexisting allergic rhinitis, dermatitis or
      urticaria.

TI  - Comparative study between fluticasone propionate and cetirizine in the treatment 
      of allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 277-82
AB  - Among the most frequently used drugs in the treatment of allergic rhinitis we
      have to mention topical nasal corticosteroids and H1 antihistamines used both
      systemically and topically. The present study focused the effectiveness and
      tolerability of cetirizine and fluticasone propionate in seasonal allergic
      rhinitis. 54 patients, divided into three homogeneous groups, underwent the
      following different treatments: Group 1: Placebo of fluticasone (2 puff per
      nostril once daily by aerosol) + cetirizine (10 mg/die per os) for 60 days. Group
      2: Fluticasone (100 mg per nostril once daily by aerosol) + placebo of cetirizine
      (per os) for 60 days. Group 3: Cetirizine (10 mg/die per os) for 60 days +
      fluticasone (100 mg per nostril once daily by aerosol) for 20 days. The patients 
      reported nasal symptoms (sneezing, obstruction, itching, rhinorrea) on a clinical
      diary. ECP levels in nasal secretions were investigated in all patients to
      determine the anti-inflammatory activity of both treatments. Cetirizine resulted 
      very effective in the treatment of sneezing, itching and acqueous rhinorrea
      whereas not much effective on nasal obstruction. On the contrary, fluticasone,
      which acted effectively on nasal obstruction, resulted inefficacious on the other
      symptoms. The third group of patients achieved the best results on all four
      symptoms, including obstruction, which continued even after interrupting the
      treatment with fluticasone. The ECP levels were significantly reduced by both
      treatments. The side effects in all 3 groups were rare and not serious. From
      these results we can assert that the synergic action of the two drugs, achieves
      the best effectiveness, that the fluticasone treatment can be limited to 20 days 
      cycles and finally that both molecules are well tolerated.

TI  - In vivo and ex vivo inhibitory effects of loratadine on histamine release in
      patients with allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 1183-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo and ex vivo effects
      of the H1-antagonist loratadine on histamine release. METHODS: The study was
      designed as a double-blind, crossover trial. Ten patients with allergic rhinitis 
      due to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus were treated with loratadine (10 mg daily
      p.o.) and with placebo for 1 week, with a 2-week interval between the two
      treatments. Nasal lavages with saline solution were done before and after
      challenge with the relevant allergen at the end of treatments with loratadine and
      placebo. Venous blood was taken after treatments, and basophil histamine release 
      induced by anti-IgE (10 microg/ml), N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine
      (fMLP, 1 microM), and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (1 microM) was evaluated by an
      automated fluorometric method. RESULTS: Treatment with loratadine attenuated
      early antigen-induced nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and itching. Nasal symptoms 
      were accompanied by a significant histamine release in the nasal lavages
      collected 5 min after stimulation when the patients received placebo (median 4
      ng/ml, range 1-28; P < 0.05). After treatment with loratadine, histamine release 
      in the 5-min postchallenge lavages was almost abrogated (median 0.5 ng/ml, range 
      0-3; P < 0.01 vs placebo). Median anti-IgE-induced histamine release from
      basophils was 41.9% (range 27.8-79.2) after placebo and 30.0% (range 1.7-73.3, P 
      < 0.05) after loratadine. Active treatment exerted an inhibitory effect also on
      basophil histamine release induced by fMLP and Ca2+ ionophore A23187.
      CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for 1 week with loratadine reduces allergen-induced nasal 
      symptoms and inhibits in vivo and ex vivo histamine release in patients with
      allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Dose proportionality and comparison of single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics 
      of fexofenadine (MDL 16455) and its enantiomers in healthy male volunteers.
PG  - 455-63
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of fexofenadine, a new non-sedating
      antihistamine, and its enantiomers were characterized after single and
      multiple-dose administration of its hydrochloride salt. A total of 24 healthy
      male volunteers (31 +/- 8 years) received oral doses of 20, 60, 120 and 240 mg
      fexofenadine HCl in a randomized, complete four-period cross-over design.
      Subjects received a single oral dose on day 1, and multiple oral doses every 12 h
      on day 3 through the morning on day 7. Treatments were separated by a 14-day
      washout period. Serial blood and urine samples were collected for up to 48 h
      following the first and last doses of fexofenadine HCl. Fexofenadine and its R(+)
      and S(-) enantiomers were analysed in plasma and urine by validated HPLC methods.
      Fexofenadine pharmacokinetics were linear across the 20-120 mg dose range, but a 
      small disproportionate increase in area under the plasma concentration-time curve
      (AUC) (< 25%) was observed following the 240 mg dose. Single-dose
      pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine were predictive of steady-state
      pharmacokinetics. Urinary elimination of fexofenadine played a minor role (10%)
      in the disposition of this drug. A 63:37 steady-state ratio of R(+) and S(-)
      fexofenadine was observed in plasma. This ratio was essentially constant across
      time and dose. R(+) and S(-) fexofenadine were eliminated into urine in equal
      rates and quantities. All doses of fexofenadine HCl were well tolerated after
      single and multiple-dose administration.

TI  - Mometasone furoate. A review of its intranasal use in allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 725-45
AB  - Mometasone furoate is a synthetic corticosteroid which has been evaluated for
      intranasal use in the treatment of adults and children with allergic rhinitis. In
      several large, well-controlled clinical trials, mometasone furoate 200 micrograms
      administered once daily as an aqueous intranasal spray was significantly more
      effective than placebo in controlling the symptoms associated with moderate to
      severe seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis. Mometasone furoate was as
      effective as twice-daily beclomethasone dipropionate or once-daily fluticasone
      propionate in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis, and was as effective 
      as twice-daily beclomethasone dipropionate and slightly more effective than
      once-daily oral loratadine in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
      Mometasone furoate was also as effective as twice-daily beclomethasone
      dipropionate or once-daily budesonide, and significantly more effective than
      placebo in the prophylaxis of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The onset of action of 
      mometasone furoate was approximately 7 hours in patients with seasonal allergic
      rhinitis. Mometasone furoate was as well tolerated as beclomethasone
      dipropionate, fluticasone propionate and budesonide in clinical trials, with an
      overall incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. Adverse events were
      generally mild to moderate and of limited duration. The most common adverse
      events associated with mometasone furoate therapy were nasal irritation and/or
      burning, headache, epistaxis and pharyngitis. Intranasal or oral mometasone
      furoate had no detectable effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function 
      in studies of < or = 1 year in duration. CONCLUSIONS: Mometasone furoate is a
      well tolerated intranasal corticosteroid with minimal systemic activity and an
      onset of action of < or = 7 hours. It is effective in the prophylaxis and
      treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis and the treatment of perennial allergic
      rhinitis in patients with moderate to severe symptoms.

TI  - Efficacy and safety relative to placebo of an oral formulation of cetirizine and 
      sustained-release pseudoephedrine in the management of nasal congestion.
PG  - 849-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of an oral 
      formulation of cetirizine 5 mg with sustained-release pseudoephedrine (PSE) 120
      mg relative to placebo in patients with nasal congestion. METHODS: Twenty-four
      patients with perennial rhinitis due to house-dust-mite (HDM) allergy were
      recruited in this crossover study. A treatment period of 1 week, in which
      cetirizine/PSE was administered twice daily, was followed by a washout period of 
      at least 2 weeks and a further period of 1 week in which the alternative
      treatment was given to each patient. Immediately after the first dose of each
      medication (day 1), nasal congestion and related symptoms were assessed during a 
      7-h challenge with HDM feces, with the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC), to
      investigate onset of action of the preparation. A second challenge of 3-h
      duration, carried out at least 12 h after the final dose, was undertaken after 1 
      week (mean) of twice-daily treatment to assess residual effects of the
      formulation after achievement of steady state. RESULTS: The oral formulation of
      cetirizine/PSE was significantly (P<0.001) superior to placebo in improving nasal
      obstruction during both challenges. The improvement in nasal airflow and nasal
      patency was significantly greater with cetirizine/PSE than with placebo (P<0.02).
      In addition, subjective assessment of nasal symptoms showed that cetirizine/PSE
      was significantly superior to placebo in both challenges for the sum of nasal
      obstruction scores (P<0.01). Both medications were well tolerated, and no serious
      adverse events occurred during the study. CONCLUSIONS: In this study,
      cetirizine/PSE relieved nasal congestion and other objective and subjective
      symptoms to a significantly greater extent than placebo. No serious adverse
      events occurred, and both regimens were equally well tolerated.

TI  - [Accidental cetirizine poisoning in a four-year-old boy].
PG  - 5946-7
AB  - Cetirizine is a commonly used non-sedating antihistamine for the symptomatic
      relief of allergic reactions. Few reports exist on the result of overdose in
      children. We would like to report the result of a 12 fold overdose of cetirizine 
      in a four-year-old-boy (weight 20 kg) who accidentally ingested 60 mg. Vomiting
      was induced 1 1/2 hour after ingestion in the out-patient clinic at the local
      hospital because of severe drowsiness. Due to continued lethargy he was
      transferred to the referral paediatric department for further observation. He was
      fully recovered after five to six hours without any treatment.
      Electrocardiographic monitoring was normal. Five incidents of cetirizine overdose
      in children have been reported previously. Drowsiness and sedation were observed,
      but no other side effects. The risk of cardiac events related to an overdose of
      cetirizine is extremely small. A certain degree of sedation is to be expected.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of cetirizine and ebastine on the skin response to
      histamine iontophoresis monitored with laser Doppler flowmetry.
PG  - 146-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: The administration of histamine with iontophoresis is an alternative 
      method to skin prick tests or intradermal injections. Skin reactions obtained
      with this method can be recorded with laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and previous 
      studies with this method have shown histamine-induced laser Doppler changes in
      the wheal area. OBJECTIVE: In order to compare the influence of two H1 receptor
      antagonists (cetirizine 10 mg vs. ebastine 10 mg) on the skin vascular responses 
      to histamine introduced by iontophoresis, we designed a double-blind, randomized,
      two-period crossover trial in which 18 volunteers were randomized. METHODS:
      Before and 2, 5 and 7 h after drug administration, iontophoresis (30 s, 1.4
      mA/cm2) of histamine 10% was performed and followed by (1) monitoring of skin
      vascular responses with LDF at the administration site and at 1 cm from it, and
      (2) wheal and flare area measurements. RESULTS: 2, 5 and 7 h after intake of the 
      antihistaminic drug, there were significant differences between both drugs.
      Concerning LDF recordings, we noted at the histamine administration site an
      increase in perfusion unit (PU) values which is an effect known to be in
      proportion to the degree of inhibition of wheal reaction, and at 1 cm distal to
      the histamine administration site, there was a decrease in PU values. These
      changes were more marked under cetirizine. A greater suppressive effect of
      cetirizine on the wheal and flare reaction was consistently observed at all time 
      points during the study, demonstrating its superior efficacy. CONCLUSION: We
      conclude that (1) cetirizine demonstrated a stronger antihistaminic effect
      compared to ebastine at all time points; (2) iontophoresis appears to be an
      appropriate method to study specific microvascular changes at the delivery site
      of histamine and hence to detect the earliest changes occurring at the site of
      agonist-antagonist competition in the skin.

TI  - A comparison of the efficacy of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray and
      loratadine, alone and in combination, for the treatment of seasonal allergic
      rhinitis.
PG  - 118-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intranasal corticosteroids and oral antihistamines are both effective
      in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, although the therapeutic value of
      administering the two types of agents concurrently has rarely been evaluated.
      This study was designed to compared the efficacy, safety, and impact on quality
      of life of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (FP ANS), loratadine, FP
      ANS plus loratadine, and placebo (an aqueous nasal spray plus tablet) in the
      treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis during the mountain cedar allergy season 
      in south central Texas. METHODS: Six hundred patients with seasonal allergic
      rhinitis were treated for 2 weeks with either FP ANS 200 microgram once daily,
      loratadine 10 mg once daily, the FP ANS and loratadine regimens combined, or
      placebo in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group 
      study. RESULTS: Clinician- and patient-rated total and individual nasal symptom
      scores after 7 and 14 days of therapy and overall evaluations were significantly 
      lower (P < .001) in the FP ANS and FP ANS plus loratadine groups compared with
      the loratadine only and placebo groups. Loratadine was not statistically
      different from placebo in clinician and patient symptom score ratings nor in
      overall clinician and patient evaluations. FP ANS plus loratadine and FP ANS
      monotherapy were comparable in efficacy in almost all evaluations; for some
      patient-rated symptoms the combination was found superior. Mean score changes in 
      the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire from baseline to day 14
      showed significantly greater improvement (P < .001) in quality of life in the FP 
      ANS group than in the group of patients receiving loratadine only or placebo and 
      no significant benefit was demonstrated in the FP ANS plus loratadine group over 
      the FP ANS monotherapy group. No serious or unusual drug-related adverse events
      were reported. Combining loratadine with FP ANS did not alter the adverse events 
      profile or frequency.

TI  - Atorvastatin does not produce a clinically significant effect on the
      pharmacokinetics of terfenadine.
PG  - 753-7
AB  - The effect of atorvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate, on the pharmacokinetics of
      terfenadine and its carboxylic acid metabolite, fexofenadine, were evaluated.
      Single 120-mg doses of terfenadine were given 2 weeks apart to healthy volunteers
      with 80-mg daily doses of atorvastatin administered from 7 days before through 2 
      days after the second terfenadine dose. Concentrations of terfenadine and
      fexofenadine were measured for 72 hours after each terfenadine dose.
      Administration of terfenadine alone or in combination with atorvastatin produced 
      no alterations in the QTc interval. For terfenadine, atorvastatin
      coadministration produced an 8% decrease in maximum concentration (Cmax), a 35%
      increase in area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity
      (AUC0-infinity), and a 2% decrease in elimination half-life (t1/2). For
      fexofenadine, atorvastatin coadministration produced a 16% decrease in Cmax, a 2%
      decrease in AUC0-infinity and a 51 % increase in t1/2. None of these changes
      achieved statistical significance. Coadministration of atorvastatin with
      terfenadine does not result in a clinically significant drug interaction. Because
      80 mg is the highest atorvastatin dose used clinically, drug interactions
      mediated by CYP3A4 inhibition are unlikely in clinical practice.

TI  - [Levocabastine versus cetirizine for perennial allergic rhinitis in children].
PG  - 7-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of levocabastine nasal spray asid
      cetirizine oral for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis in children.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this randomized, prospective experimental, open clinical
      trial. We studied 30 children with ages between 6 and 16 years with perennial
      allergic rhinitis. Group 1, 17 subjects (7 female, 10 male) received cetirizine
      once daily, 5 mg children weientig less dian 30 k asid 10 mg in children weighing
      more trw' 30 k during 15 days. Group 2, 13 subjects (7 male, 6 female) received
      levocabastine 2 puffs BID on each nostril during tbe same time. A nasal symptoms 
      score, nasal peal: flow vid eosinophils in a nasal smear were performed before
      and after treatment. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in age,
      weight, height and arid duration of symptoms. Both groups showed improvement of
      symptoms via nasal peak flow with no differences between them (intergroup); nasal
      eosinophils remained unchanged. We for third statistical differences pre vid
      postreatment in each group (intragroup): Group 1, nasal congestion p = 0.002,
      ocular itch p = 0.01, sneezing p = 0.007, nasal secretion p = 0.01, nasal itch O 
      = 0.009, total points O = 0.0005. Group 2, nasal congestion O = 0.02, ocular itch
      p = 0.05, sneezing p = 0.01, nasal secretion p = 0.01, nasal itch p = 0.04, total
      points p = 0.005. Significant differences were found in nasal peal' flow in Group
      1 (p = 0.01) but no differences in eosinophils between file two groups. Side
      effects: 3 subjects in Group 1 (drowsiness, 1 appetite increase said 1 rhinorrea 
      with epistaxis) vide 1 in Group 2 sensation of facial edema. CONCLUSION: Bofil
      drugs are effective the clinical relief of symptoms of perennial allergic
      rhinitis in children vied levocabastine has less side effects.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of sublingual immunotherapy with
      standardized olive pollen extract in pediatric patients with allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis and mild asthma due to olive pollen sensitization.
PG  - 662-72
AB  - For evaluation of the efficacy and the safety of specific sublingual
      immunotherapy with high allergen dose, 66 children with seasonal asthma,
      rhinitis, and conjunctivitis due to sensitization to olive pollen were enrolled
      in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study between October 1994 and 
      October 1996 in Greece. Thirty-four patients were randomly allocated to the
      active group, and 32 received placebo. Immunotherapy consisted of olive-allergen 
      extracts (Stallergenes SA) administered sublingually pre- and coseasonally from
      January to July for 2 consecutive years. Serial concentrations from 1 to 300 IR. 
      were used up to the maintenance dose of 20 drops of 300 IR daily. The cumulative 
      dose for each patient was 300 times higher than in parenteral immunotherapy, and 
      the cumulative dose of the major allergen Ole e 1 was 8.1 mg/2 years. The
      patients were assessed by clinical parameters (symptom and medication scores from
      patients' daily diaries) and immunologic measurements (specific IgE, IgG4,
      eosinophil cationic protein [ECP]) were performed. The actively treated patients 
      had a significantly lower score for dyspnea (P<0.04 during the first season;
      P<0.03 during the second season). At the pollinic peak during the second year, a 
      lower score of conjunctivitis was recorded (P<0.05) in the actively treated
      patients. The analysis of intragroup evolution showed that the total score of
      rhinitis increased significantly during the pollinic peak in the group under
      placebo, whereas there was no symptomatic peak for the same period in the group
      under active treatment. However, the difference between the groups was not
      significant. The medication score did not differ significantly between the
      groups. Oral steroids were the only variables with a P value near the
      significance level (P=0.06) in favor of the actively treated group. A significant
      decrease in skin reactivity was recorded in the active group after 2 years of
      treatment. No significant variation in specific IgE and IgG4 was detected. A
      significantly lower level of serum ECP was observed at the pollinic peak in the
      actively treated patients during the first pollen season (P=0.01), but this was
      not confirmed the second year when the ECP levels doubled in both groups without 
      correlation to the clinical findings. Tolerance was excellent with only a few
      minor side-effects reported. In conclusion, high-dose specific sublingual
      immunotherapy appears to be safe and effective in improving mild seasonal asthma 
      and conjunctivitis linked to olive-pollen sensitization.

TI  - Changes in skin-test reactivity do not correlate with clinical efficacy of
      H1-blockers in seasonal allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 579-85
AB  - New-generation H1-blockers may possess antiallergic properties, and their effect 
      may differ, depending on the target organ. A double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study was carried out during the pollen season to compare the
      clinical effect on nasal and conjunctival symptoms of astemizole (10 mg o.d.) and
      loratadine (10 mg o.d.) with their effect on skin-test reactivity to allergen and
      histamine. Thirty-eight patients (12-56 years of age) were studied. Nasal and
      ocular symptoms were recorded daily from days 4 to 7. Skin prick tests with
      serial concentrations of allergens and one concentration of histamine were
      carried out before and at the end of the 7-day treatment period. Parallel-line
      bioassay, analysis of variance, and covariance were used to analyze skin test
      data. Loratadine and astemizole significantly decreased symptoms from baseline (P
      < 0.004 and P < 0.006). Skin-test reactivity to allergen and histamine was more
      profoundly decreased by astemizole than loratadine. The histamine covariant was
      more important in the allergen effect of astemizole than in that of loratadine.
      Two H1-blockers having the same clinical effect on nasal and ocular symptoms
      during the pollen season have totally different effects on skin-test reactivity. 
      Skin-test reactivity to allergen or histamine is not predictive of the clinical
      efficacy of H1-blockers during seasonal allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Effects of H1 antagonists on the cutaneous vascular response to histamine and
      bradykinin: a study using scanning laser Doppler imaging.
PG  - 806-14
AB  - Histamine plays an important part in the cutaneous weal and flare response which 
      underlies many allergic skin conditions. It has a direct effect on the local
      vasculature to promote vasodilatation and increase microvascular permeability and
      may also initiate the more widely spread neurogenic flare. Quantification of
      these responses and studies of the mediator mechanisms underlying them have been 
      limited by the lack of appropriate techniques to investigate them. To address
      this we have used two relatively new techniques, scanning laser Doppler imaging
      (LDI) and dermal microdialysis to measure changes in skin blood flow and the
      release of histamine within the weal and flare, following intradermal injection
      of histamine or bradykinin. These measurements have been made both in the absence
      and presence of the H1 receptor blockers cetirizine and loratadine. Scanning LDI 
      of the inflammatory response revealed marked differences in both the development 
      and steady state responses to the intradermal injection of histamine (1-3
      mumol/L) and bradykinin (1 mumol/L). The development of the flare and the weal
      response to both histamine and bradykinin was significantly reduced by cetirizine
      but not by loratadine. The histamine-induced flare area fell by 57 +/- 4% (mean
      +/- SEM, n = 10, P < 0.001) after cetirizine and the area of the weal fell by 73 
      +/- 11% (P < 0.009). Bradykinin-induced inflammatory responses were similarly
      reduced by cetirizine, the weal by 60 +/- 16% (P < 0.02) and the flare by 61 +/- 
      4% (P < 0.005). Measurement of histamine concentration in skin using
      microdialysis, in six subjects, confirmed that histamine levels rose in the
      dialysate collected from the weal to 310 +/- 16 nmol/L following injection of
      histamine. Histamine levels also rose following bradykinin injection in some
      subjects (mean 147 +/- 46 nmol/L, range 18-336). Little increase in histamine
      concentration was seen in the dialysate from the flare following injection of
      either histamine or bradykinin. The histamine concentration in dialysate from
      unprovoked skin was 4.19 +/- 0.75 nmol/L. These data reveal differences in the
      dermal responses to different mediators when assessed using scanning LDI. They
      confirm that histamine is released within the weal but not the flare response to 
      the intradermal injection of both histamine and bradykinin and that its effects
      on the local vasculature to cause the oedematous weal and the axon
      reflex-mediated flare are significantly attenuated by the H1 antagonist
      cetirizine and to a lesser extent by the H1 antagonist loratadine.

TI  - Effects of methysergide and loratadine on food intake, mood, and performance of
      humans living in a residential laboratory.
PG  - 159-64
AB  - The effects of loratadine, a peripherally acting histamine (H1) antagonist, and
      methysergide, a serotonin (5-HT) antagonist, were evaluated in seven
      normal-weight, male research volunteers, participating in a placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, 17-day residential study. Participants received oral loratadine (10
      or 20 mg), methysergide (4 or 8 mg), or placebo at 1000 and 1700 hours daily.
      Active drug was administered on Days 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, and 16; placebo was 
      administered on all other days. Drug and dose order were counterbalanced across
      participants. Food intake, performance, and subjective ratings were measured
      repeatedly throughout the day. Loratadine had no effect on food intake,
      performance, or subjective ratings. In contrast, total caloric intake
      significantly decreased from approximately 3500 kcal during placebo
      administration to 3065 kcal on the first but not the second day of methysergide
      administration. Consumption of carbohydrate (p < 0.055), protein, and fat
      decreased on the first day of methysergide administration. This decrease in food 
      intake was due to a decrease in meal size; the number of meals consumed was not
      affected. The proportion of calories derived from carbohydrates significantly
      increased on the first day of methysergide administration. Methysergide also
      significantly impaired performance of a psychomotor task on the first day of
      high-dose administration and increased ratings of several subjective measures,
      including "Vomiting," "Stomach Pain," and "Miserable." These results suggest that
      the anorectic effect occurred as a result of the somatic and mood changes
      produced by methysergide. In addition, the inability of loratadine to affect food
      intake indicates that antagonism of central histamine receptors may be
      responsible for the increases in food intake produced by other antihistamines
      (e.g., diphenhydramine).

TI  - Clinical efficacy of sublingual-swallow immunotherapy: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of a standardized five-grass-pollen extract in rhinitis.
PG  - 493-8
AB  - Sublingual-swallow immunotherapy (SLIT) using high doses of standardized allergen
      extracts has been found to be effective in reducing allergic symptoms and
      medication needs. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out in a
      large number of patients to determine whether medication needs can be reduced by 
      SLIT. Some 136 patients with grass-pollen rhinitis with or without mild asthma
      were studied. Patients received either placebo or SLIT with a standardized
      grass-pollen extract administered daily with increasing doses up to 300 IR (index
      of reactivity) from January to the end of July 1994. During the grass-pollen
      season, patients were instructed to use medications as required and to visit
      their doctors in case of asthma. Symptom-medications scores were assessed during 
      the pollen season, and serum-specific IgG4 was measured before and at the end of 
      SLIT. In the SLIT group, drug consumption dropped significantly throughout the
      pollen season (P < 0.02). Moreover, at the peak of the pollen season,
      betamethasone consumption was significantly reduced in the SLIT group (P < 0.02).
      Only one patient in the SLIT group had an asthma attack compared to eight
      patients in the placebo group (P < 0.02). IgG4 levels increased significantly in 
      the SLIT group (P < 0.001) but without correlation with symptoms. Side-effects
      were comparable in both groups. This study indicates that SLIT in grass-pollen
      rhinitis is well tolerated, improves overall clinical symptoms, and reduces drug 
      consumption and the need for oral corticosteroids.

TI  - Troglitazone in type II diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 539-48
AB  - Troglitazone, a new antihyperglycemic agent, is approved for use alone, with oral
      sulfonylureas, or with insulin in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus.
      Rather than stimulating insulin secretion, it enhances insulin sensitivity.
      Potential advantages of troglitazone over oral sulfonylureas include decreased
      endogenous insulin concentrations, decreased exogenous insulin requirements,
      reduced hypoglycemic risk, and convenient once/day administration. The effect on 
      morbidity and mortality from lowering endogenous and exogenous insulin
      concentrations remains to be determined. Troglitazone also has potential
      disadvantages. It induces cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4, although few drug
      interactions have been identified to date. Serum transaminases must be monitored 
      routinely because of rarely reported cases of idiosyncratic hepatocellular
      injury. In addition, the cost of troglitazone is much higher than that of other
      oral antihyperglycemic agents or insulin. Given the available information,
      troglitazone has limited benefit over oral sulfonylureas or metformin as
      monotherapy or in combination with oral sulfonylureas. Until additional
      combination and comparative studies have been done, the agent should be reserved 
      for patients with poor glycemic control receiving high daily doses of insulin.

TI  - Determinants of interindividual variability and extent of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2
      inhibition by paroxetine and fluvoxamine in vivo.
PG  - 198-207
AB  - Major depression may require antidepressant treatment for several years. This
      necessitates consideration of the long-term effects of antidepressants on
      multiple clinical endpoints. The antidepressants paroxetine and fluvoxamine are
      potent in vitro inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 isozymes, respectively. CYP2D6
      and CYP1A2 are important for the clearance of 30 or more frequently used
      medications. Moreover, CYP1A2 also contributes to metabolism of 17beta-estradiol 
      and metabolic activation of environmental procarcinogens (e.g., arylamines in
      cigarette smoke). The aim of this study was to assess the determinants of
      interindividual variability and extent of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 inhibition during
      paroxetine and fluvoxamine treatment. Healthy volunteers and patients received
      caffeine (100 mg) and dextromethorphan (30 mg) at baseline and at steady state of
      paroxetine (10-20 mg/day, 5-74 days, N = 13) or fluvoxamine (50-100 mg/day, 5-43 
      days, N = 8). The caffeine metabolic ratio (CMR) and the log O-demethylation
      ratio (ODMR) of dextromethorphan in overnight urine were used as in vivo indices 
      of the CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 isozyme activities, respectively. All subjects had an
      extensive metabolizer phenotype for CYP2D6. After fluvoxamine treatment, baseline
      CMR 5.1 +/- 1.4 (mean +/- SD) decreased to 2.7 +/- 1.1 (p < 0.01). Paroxetine did
      not have a significant effect on CMR (p > 0.05). In seven of eight subjects in
      the fluvoxamine group, posttreatment CMR was comparable with the minimum CMR
      value (2.0) attainable in nonsmoking healthy volunteers. After paroxetine
      treatment, log ODMR changed from a baseline value of -2.28 +/- 0.37 to -1.13 +/- 
      0.44, indicating significant inhibition of CYP2D6 (p < 0.001). Subjects' CYP2D6
      phenotype did not change after paroxetine treatment. Fluvoxamine had no
      significant effect on log ODMR (p > 0.05). The extent of inhibition of CYP2D6 and
      CYP1A2 by paroxetine and fluvoxamine, respectively, displayed a positive
      correlation with baseline enzyme activity (p < 0.05). In addition, a negative
      association was found between the plasma paroxetine concentration and the CYP2D6 
      activity after paroxetine treatment (r = -0.47, p < 0.05). These data indicate
      that paroxetine and fluvoxamine treatment with minimum clinically effective doses
      significantly inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, respectively. The extent of inhibition
      of CYP2D6 by paroxetine and of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine is dependent in part on the 
      baseline enzyme activity. The interindividual variability in CYP2D6 inhibition by
      paroxetine can also be explained by variability in plasma paroxetine
      concentration. Most patients treated with fluvoxamine (50-100 mg/day) will reach 
      population minimums for CYP1A2 activity. These results have potential
      implications for interindividual variability in the risk for drug-drug
      interactions mediated by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 as well as for the disposition of
      17beta-estradiol and environmental procarcinogens.

TI  - Antiinflammatory properties of cetirizine in a human contact dermatitis model.
      Clinical evaluation of patch tests is not hampered by antihistamines.
PG  - 194-7
AB  - The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over pilot
      study was to assess the antiinflammatory properties of cetirizine. A group of 27 
      patients with a positive patch test to an allergen consecutively received
      cetirizine 10 mg o.d. or placebo during a 14-day period, respectively. At day 11 
      of each period, patch testing was performed with the allergen. The image analysis
      showed a skin reaction significantly reduced under cetirizine (p = 0.03), but the
      clinical recording and the standardized chromatometry did not show any difference
      between groups. In the cross-over analysis the results of image analysis were
      influenced by the period, but this effect disappeared after adjustment of the
      ambient temperature during the 3 days of the test. These results demonstrate that
      cetirizine has an impact on the inflammatory process in a clinical model of
      cell-mediated allergic reaction, although this effect is only detected with a
      very sensitive technique. They also show that it is useless to stop
      antihistamines before patch testing, since clinical evaluation of tests is not
      hampered by a potent antihistamine. Additionally this study suggests that ambient
      temperature has an influence on the results of tests.

      placebo-controlled comparative clinical trial.
PG  - 382-9
AB  - A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study
      was conducted to compare the effectiveness of an extended-release formulation of 
      a classical antihistamine, brompheniramine, and a second-generation compound,
      loratadine, in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Subjects with symptoms of
      allergic rhinitis received brompheniramine 12 mg twice daily (n = 112),
      loratadine 10 mg once daily (n = 112), or placebo twice daily (n = 114) for 7
      days. Study medications were blinded using a double-dummy technique. Subjects
      completed an overall evaluation of symptom relief on a daily basis and returned
      on treatment days 3 and 7, at which times the investigator assessed symptom
      severity. The investigator and subject each completed a global efficacy
      evaluation, and subjects were interviewed regarding adverse experiences. The
      primary efficacy variable was the physicians' global efficacy evaluation on day
      3. Symptoms also were analyzed as summed severity scores for all symptoms and for
      the nasal symptom cluster of rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal blockage. At all
      post-baseline evaluations (days 3, 7, and averaged over the two days),
      brompheniramine was significantly better than loratadine and placebo for both
      sets of summed symptom scores and all three global assessments. Loratadine was
      significantly better than placebo for physician ratings of total symptom severity
      averaged over the two days and for the physician and subject ratings of the nasal
      cluster on day 3. Central nervous system-related symptoms were the most
      frequently reported adverse experiences; somnolence was reported most frequently 
      by patients taking brompheniramine, and its occurrence was less frequent as
      treatment continued. A nonprescription, extended-release formulation of
      brompheniramine 12 mg twice daily provided significantly better relief of
      symptomatic allergic rhinitis than loratadine 10 mg once daily.

TI  - [From atopic dermatitis to asthma].
PG  - 477-81
AB  - Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic skin disorder in infancy and
      childhood and is the main hallmark of atopic constitution. The disease is
      multifactorial, and although genetic predisposition is certainly a prerequisite, 
      a number of environmental factors modulate the phenotypic expression of AD. The
      majority of affected children shows IgE sensitisation towards a large variety of 
      foods and aeroallergens. Since at least 1600, it has been recognized that
      patients with AD have a high predisposition to develop asthma. Recent
      epidemiological studies show that AD is commonly seen in individuals from
      families with a history of asthma. In addition, in population where asthma is
      uncommon, AD is also uncommon. The sex distribution of AD and asthma is the same,
      with boys affected significantly more often by these two atopic diseases and in
      similar proportions. The ETAC project (Early Treatment of the Atopic Child) is a 
      large multicenter, multi-national, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised
      trial. The main objective of the study is to stop the progression from AD to
      asthma in young children with AD using early therapeutic intervention with
      Cetirizine and the second objective is to investigate the main risk factors for
      the onset of asthma. The results of this study indicate that exposure to potent
      allergens such as cat or mite significantly increased the risk of sensitisation
      to these allergens. Prolonged breast feeding was associated with a lowest
      sensitisation rate to cow milk proteins and to egg. Therefore environmental
      factors seem to play a crucial role in IgE sensitisation in children with AD.

TI  - Cetirizine reduces conjunctival nonspecific hyperreactivity in children with mite

PG  - 23-6
AB  - As mite allergy is characterized by a continuous allergen exposure, persistent
      inflammation is always detectable even during symptomless periods. It has been
      reported that mite allergic patients present a nonspecific hyperreactivity to
      different stimuli, including hyperosmolar solution. Since it has been reported
      previously that cetirizine is able to reduce minimal persistent inflammation due 
      to mite allergy, the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of cetirizine
      on nonspecific conjunctival hyperreactivity. Twenty children with mite allergy
      were studied; two hyperosmolar conjunctival challenges were performed before and 
      after cetirizine or placebo treatment, lasting one week. Patients treated with
      cetirizine showed a significant reduction in nonspecific conjunctival
      hyperreactivity compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). In conclusion,
      cetirizine was able to reduce nonspecific hyperreactivity related to allergic
      inflammation.

TI  - Troglitazone: review and assessment of its role in the treatment of patients with
      impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 337-48
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To introduce troglitazone (CS-045, Rezulin), a new oral antidiabetic
      agent and discuss its pharmacology, therapeutics, pharmacokinetics, dosing
      guidelines, adverse effects, drug interactions, and clinical efficacy. DATA
      SOURCES: A MEDLINE database search was completed to identify relevant articles
      including reviews, recent studies and abstracts, and data from Parke-Davis. STUDY
      SELECTION: Due to the small number of published human studies available, some
      data are derived from animal studies and abstracts of human studies. Studies and 
      abstracts chosen summarize the clinical action of troglitazone in healthy
      volunteers, in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, and in patients with
      diabetes mellitus. Three of the six published human studies used subjects in a
      placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized environment (type 2 diabetic patients
      or obese subjects with insulin resistance). DATA EXTRACTION: All clinical trials 
      available, including unpublished reports, were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Troglitazone is the first member of a new class of medications, the
      thiazolidinediones, to be approved for clinical use. Troglitazone increases
      insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and in hepatic and adipose tissue. It has 
      been shown to decrease hepatic glucose output while having no effect on
      stimulating insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta-cells. Its metabolic
      effects decrease fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia, insulin concentrations, 
      and triglyceride concentrations, while increasing high-density lipoprotein
      concentrations. There is some evidence, based on short-term trials, that
      troglitazone causes only minimal decreases in glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C)
      concentrations. Data suggest that troglitazone decreases impaired glucose
      tolerance in nondiabetic obese subjects and leads to a reduction in both systolic
      and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
      Troglitazone has a mild adverse effect profile, with rare instances of abnormal
      liver function tests. CONCLUSIONS: Troglitazone appears to be a safe, effective, 
      and useful new agent in the treatment of insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes
      mellitus patients, although its HbA1C-lowering effects have been minimal in
      short-term trials, and its insulin dosage-reduction activity remains unclear. The
      Food and Drug Administration has also approved its use as monotherapy and in
      combination with sulfonylureas for patients with type 2 diabetes. It may have use
      in the treatment of patients with impaired glucose tolerance, but more clinical
      experience is needed before definitive conclusions can be made. The role of
      troglitazone therapy in diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose intolerance will
      continue to evolve as the results of studies and our clinical experience with
      this agent become available.

TI  - Fexofenadine.
PG  - 269-74; discussion 275-6
AB  - The nonsedating histamine H1 receptor antagonist fexofenadine is the active
      metabolite of terfenadine. It reduced the allergic response in animal models of
      allergy and did not prolong the QT interval (QTc) in dogs or rabbits at plasma
      concentrations many times higher than those seen after administration of
      therapeutic dosages. Similarly, relative to placebo, fexofenadine did not affect 
      mean QTc in patients given dosages of up to 480 mg/day for 2 weeks or in
      volunteers who received up to 800 mg/day for 6 days or 240 mg/day for 12 months. 
      In a double-blind clinical trial, oral fexofenadine 120 or 180mg once daily
      controlled symptoms in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis as effectively as
      cetirizine. Other double-blind clinical trials showed that fexofenadine 40 to
      240mg twice daily was significantly more effective than placebo. Fexofenadine 180
      or 240mg once daily was significantly more effective than placebo in patients
      with chronic idiopathic urticaria. The drug was well tolerated in these clinical 
      trials, with an adverse event profile similar to that seen with placebo. The most
      common adverse events were headache, throat irritation, viral infection, nausea, 
      dysmenorrhoea, drowsiness, dyspepsia and fatigue.

TI  - Loratadine-pseudoephedrine in children with allergic rhinitis, a controlled
      double-blind trial.
PG  - 147-50
AB  - AIMS: To conduct a randomized placebo controlled double-blind crossover trial in 
      order to evaluate a loratadine-pseudoephedrine combination (L + PS) in children
      with seasonal allergic rhinitis. METHODS: Forty children (15 males; 25 females), 
      aged 3-15 years, were included in this study. They were randomized to receive L +
      PS (0.2 mg kg[-1] body weight-2.4 mg kg[-1] body weight respectively) or placebo 
      (PLA) for 14 days. After 7 days of washout, patients were shifted to the other
      treatment for a further 14 days. Nasal symptoms (sneezing/itching, congestion,
      nasal dripping) and signs (turbinal swelling, retronasal drainage), rated on a
      scale ranging from: 1. absent to 5. very intense, and their sum or mean total
      symptom score (MTSS) were used as efficacy measurement. RESULTS: Significant
      relief was observed; post-treatment MTSS difference and its percent change were
      respectively; L + PS = -4.29; 95% CI: -3.64 and -4.94 (27.8%), and PLA = -1.63;
      95% CI: -0.95 and -2.31 (10.7%) (P < 0.001 baseline vs endpoint and between
      treatments). Furthermore, L + PS and PLA significantly modified symptoms, but
      only L + PS significantly modified signs. No clinical changes were observed
      during the trial; only one patient showed slight transient insomnia when
      receiving L + PS. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that L + PS is useful and well
      tolerated in children with seasonal allergic rhinitis. However, elements such as 
      placebo effect must be taken into account for planning future trials.

TI  - Effect of continuous allergen challenge on clinical symptoms and mediator release
      in dust-mite-allergic patients.
PG  - 68-72
AB  - This study investigated the early, prolonged immediate, and late-phase reactions 
      of dust-mite-sensitive subjects undergoing long-term challenge in the Vienna
      challenge chamber (VCC) in terms of clinical symptoms and inflammatory mediator
      level patterns in nasal lavage fluids. A concentration of 70 ng Der p 1/m3 of air
      (feces of Dermatophagoides) was maintained over 8 h in the VCC. To show the
      clinical impact of this challenge model, the effect of a histamine H1-receptor
      antagonist that also has some antiallergic properties (loratadine) was also
      investigated. The study followed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
      design. Medication was given orally over 7 days before the provocation at a dose 
      of 10 mg once daily. All 12 patients, whose dust-mite sensitivity was confirmed
      by disease history, skin prick test, and RAST, completed the challenge session.
      The documentation of the chosen parameters was performed every 30 min. Subjective
      nasal and ocular symptoms were assessed via a visual analog scale of 100 mm,
      nasal flow was recorded by active anterior rhinomanometry, and mediator release
      was evaluated with nasal lavages. Clinical aspect: the whole sample population
      showed a rise of nasal and ocular symptom severity and a nasal flow reduction,
      which were perceptibly, but not significantly attenuated by active drug
      treatment. Mediator pattern: in each patient, prostaglandin (PG)D2 and
      leukotriene (LT)C4 levels peaked within the first 2 h of provocation, PGD2 then
      moving toward baseline levels, and LTC4 then again rising continuously.
      Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) exhibited a constant level increase over the
      whole provocation period, and tryptase levels did not change significantly.
      Whereas the area under the curve values of tryptase and ECP were higher in
      drug-treated patients than the placebo group, the early PGD2 peak occurring
      during the first two challenge hours seemed to be mitigated by loratadine. These 
      results reveal that there is no link between the clinical symptoms, the drug
      efficacy, and the released mediators (LTC4, PGD2, ECP, and tryptase).

TI  - Opiate and H1 antagonist effects on histamine induced pruritus and alloknesis.
PG  - 239-43
AB  - Itching is a well known side-effect of opiate therapy. To gain insight into the
      possible contribution of opiate receptors to itching we compared the antipruritic
      effect of naltrexone (Nemexin), an opiate antagonist, to an H1-receptor
      antagonist and to placebo. In a double blind cross-over study on 15 healthy
      volunteers, 25 mg naltrexone or placebo was orally given 60 min prior to a
      histamine stimulus. In a second, otherwise identical experiment, 10 mg
      cetirizine, an H1 blocker, or placebo was orally given 12 h before the experiment
      to the same group of volunteers. Histamine was applied iontophoretically to the
      forearm skin and the following parameters were assessed thereafter: weal and
      flare size, itch intensity and the extension of the area of alloknesis ('itchy
      skin') around the application site. Naltrexone had no effect on the vascular
      histamine reactions 'weal' and 'flare', whereas cetirizine abolished the weal
      reactions and greatly diminished the flare reactions. Both naltrexone and
      cetirizine significantly diminished histamine induced itching. In contrast to
      placebo and cetirizine, naltrexone abolished alloknesis completely in four of 15 
      volunteers and in the others alloknesis was greatly reduced after naltrexone.
      Since vascular reactions to histamine are of peripheral origin, whereas
      alloknesis depends on central nervous mechanisms, our findings suggest a
      pronounced centrally mediated action of naltrexone on histamine induced pruritus.

      adult males.
PG  - 1002-12
AB  - The pharmacokinetic profiles of single and multiple doses of loratadine,
      descarboethoxyloratadine (DCL) (the major active metabolite of loratadine), and
      pseudoephedrine were determined in a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover
      study in 24 healthy men. Subjects received a single dose (day 1) and multiple
      doses (days 3 to 10) of a once-daily (QD) formulation of loratadine 10 mg in an
      immediate-release coating and pseudoephedrine sulfate 240 mg in an
      extended-release core (CLAR-ITIN-D 24 HOUR tablets), and a twice-daily (BID)
      formulation of loratadine 5 mg in an immediate-release coating and
      pseudoephedrine sulfate 120 mg, with 60 mg in an immediate-release coating and 60
      mg in the barrier-protected core (CLARITIN-D 12 HOUR tablets) in study sessions, 
      each separated by a 10-day washout period. Both regimens were safe and well
      tolerated. On day 1, plasma loratadine, DCL, and pseudoephedrine concentrations
      were higher following the QD formulation than following the BID formulation, as
      expected. On day 10, loratadine and DCL maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)
      values were, on average, 87% and 35% higher, respectively, for the QD formulation
      than for the BID formulation; however, the values of the area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) for loratadine and DCL were
      equivalent (90% confidence interval [CI]: 83% to 110% for loratadine; 90% to 107%
      for DCL). On day 10, pseudoephedrine Cmax and AUC0-24 values were equivalent (90%
      CI for Cmax: 94% to 109%; for AUC: 91% to 106%) for the two formulations, and
      lower pseudoephedrine concentrations were observed from 16 to 24 hours with the
      QD formulation. Both loratadine/pseudoephedrine formulations produced equivalent 
      loratadine and DCL AUC0-24 values and equivalent pseudoephedrine Cmax and AUC0-24
      values following multiple dosing. The lower pseudoephedrine concentrations in the
      evening with the QD formulation may minimize the potential for insomnia in
      patients when compared with the BID formulation.

TI  - Paroxetine does not affect the cardiac safety and pharmacokinetics of terfenadine
      in healthy adult men.
PG  - 451-9
AB  - Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole can cause dangerous increases in
      plasma concentrations of the H-1 antagonist terfenadine. In light of recent
      reports that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants may be
      weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, this study was designed to investigate the effects of
      paroxetine on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of terfenadine.
      Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in a randomized open-label,
      two-period, steady-state crossover study. Terfenadine (60 mg twice daily for 8
      days) was administered alone and with paroxetine at steady state (20 mg once
      daily for 15 days, with terfenadine on days 8 through 15). Extensive
      electrocardiogram monitoring was conducted throughout, and terfenadine and
      carboxyterfenadine pharmacokinetics were assessed at the end of each treatment
      period. One subject withdrew because of adverse experiences related to
      paroxetine, but the other 11 subjects completed the study uneventfully. On the
      final day of coadministration, the rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) was unaltered
      compared with terfenadine dosed alone; maximum QTc values (mean [SEM]) were 404
      (4) and 405 (5) msec, respectively. Terfenadine pharmacokinetics were also
      unchanged; geometric mean steady-state area under the curve (AUC)tau values were 
      30.0 ng.hr/mL during coadministration compared with 30.8 ng.hr/mL when dosed
      alone (p > 0.05). The corresponding Cmax values were 3.68 and 3.64 ng/mL (p >
      0.05). There was, however, a small (on average 17-20%), unexplained reduction in 
      the steadystate Cmax and AUCtau of carboxyterfenadine during coadministration
      with paroxetine. In conclusion, paroxetine does not affect the pharmacokinetics
      or cardiovascular effects of terfenadine. The small reduction in
      carboxyterfenadine plasma concentrations is unlikely to be important clinically.

TI  - Can a serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist reduce experimentally-induced 
      itch?
PG  - 412-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists have been reported to
      be a novel therapeutic principle for the treatment of cholestatic and uremic
      pruritus. OBJECTIVE: To determine the antipruritic effect of a 5-HT3 receptor
      antagonist (tropisetron) on histamine and serotonin-induced itch under
      experimental conditions in comparison to native skin and after pretreatment with 
      an orally applied antihistamine (cetirizine). METHODS: Histamine and serotonin
      were iontophoretically applied in 10 healthy volunteers. Wheals and flares were
      planimetrically evaluated. Itching and burning sensations were entered on a scale
      over 24 min. The examination also comprised alloknesis, elicitation of perifocal 
      itch sensation by usually non-itching (e.g. mechanical) stimuli. RESULTS:
      Tropisetron did not have any significant influence on histamine-induced reactions
      but could significantly reduce serotonin-induced flares. Cetirizine led to a
      significant reduction of all histamine-induced parameters and abolished
      serotonin-induced wheals. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonin has an own pruritic potency and 
      does not only act over histamine containing mast cells. The antipruritic effect
      of tropisetron reported in cholestatic and uremic pruritus could not be verified 
      in healthy persons under experimental conditions.

TI  - Effects of antihistamines in adult asthma: a meta-analysis of clinical trials.
PG  - 2216-24
AB  - A meta-analysis of clinical trials of antihistamines was performed to assess the 
      risk-benefit ratio of this therapeutic class in asthma. Double-blind randomized
      placebo-controlled trials assessing lung function changes under repeated use of
      antihistamine in adult asthma were selected, and the quality of studies was
      scored. Morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was the primary outcome: an
      effect size was computed for each study, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI),
      and a mean effect size was computed, combining all studies. Effect sizes were
      also determined for secondary outcomes: evening PEFR, forced expiratory volume in
      one second (FEV1) and daily use of inhaled beta-agonists. Nineteen studies were
      included in the meta-analysis. Mean quality score of studies was 59.4%; asthma
      was generally uncontrolled at study inclusion. Altogether, 582
      antihistamine-treated and 557 placebo-treated asthma patients were evaluable.
      Antihistamines had little effect on airway calibre (mean increase in morning
      PEFR: 13 L x min(-1); 95 CI: 8-18 L x min(-1)) and on use of inhaled
      beta-agonists (mean reduction in daily use: 0.4 doses; 95% CI: 0-0.8 doses).
      Sedation occurred more often with antihistamines than with placebo (p<0.001);
      additional side-effects were mentioned, including weight gain, altered taste,
      headache and dry mouth. Respiratory and systemic effects observed after repeated 
      use of antihistamines do not support the use of these medications in the
      treatment of asthma; better designed studies could affect this appraisal.

TI  - Initial and steady-state effects of diphenhydramine and loratadine on sedation,
      cognition, mood, and psychomotor performance.
PG  - 2350-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The classic, first-generation histamine1-receptor antagonists used to
      treat allergic disorders frequently cause sedation. In contrast, sedation is
      reduced or absent after administration of recommended doses of second-generation 
      histamine1-receptor antagonists. We measured the initial and steady-state effects
      of diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine, and loratadine, a
      second-generation antihistamine, by means of a comprehensive battery of
      psychometric tests that mirror real-world tasks. METHODS: Healthy volunteers (N =
      98) were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive loratadine (n =
      33), diphenhydramine (n = 32), or placebo (n = 33). A computerized test battery
      was administered at baseline, on day 1 after administration of the initial dose, 
      and on days 3 and 5. RESULTS: After the initial dose, subjects taking
      diphenhydramine demonstrated poorer cognitive performance than subjects taking
      loratadine or placebo on tasks of divided attention, working memory, speed, and
      vigilance. Subjects taking diphenhydramine also reported greater fatigue and
      sleepiness and lower levels of motivation, and rated the quality of their
      performance as lower than subjects taking loratadine or placebo. On day 3,
      subjects taking diphenhydramine continued to show more fatigue and lower
      motivation, and rated the quality of their test performance as poorer than
      subjects taking loratadine or placebo. There were no differences between
      loratadine and placebo after the initial dose or steady-state (day 5) dosing for 
      any measure of cognitive or psychomotor test performance, mood, or sedation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients taking diphenhydramine may be at risk of lapses and
      significant errors that may lead to potential hazards and decreased work
      productivity.

TI  - Reduction of soluble ICAM-1 levels in nasal secretion by H1-blockers in seasonal 
      allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 1022-5
AB  - ICAM-1, a transmembrane glycoprotein promoting adhesion in immunologic and
      inflammatory reactions, was found to be increased on nasal epithelial cells of
      patients with allergic rhinitis. Loratadine, an H1-blocker, was found to reduce
      in vitro the expression of ICAM-1 on nasal epithelial cells. A double-blind,
      parallel-group study was carried out during the pollen season to compare the
      effect of two H1-blockers, cetirizine (10 mg OD) and loratadine (10 mg OD), on
      the release of soluble ICAM-1 in nasal secretions. A group of untreated patients 
      was used as a control group. sICAM-1 was measured by enzyme immunoassay before
      and after 2 weeks of treatment. Symptoms were significantly decreased in the
      actively treated groups. sICAM-1 levels were unchanged in the control group but
      were significantly reduced in the two treated groups (P < 0.015, Wilcoxon's W
      test). This study shows that two H1-blockers, loratadine and cetirizine, have a
      similar effect on sICAM-1 released in nasal secretions during the pollen season.

TI  - Flare responses of atopic eczema patients analysed with true colour images.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Attenuated flare responses of atopic eczema (AE) patients
      to histamine are well documented, but their origin is still unknown. SUBJECTS AND
      METHODS: Here we studied the development of erythema after histamine
      iontophoresis in 12 AE patients and 12 healthy volunteers by means of a
      RGB-camera for recording true colour images. TREATMENT: 10 mg cetirizine or
      placebo was administered orally 3 h before the experiment in a crossover design. 
      RESULTS: The flare reaction was found to develop after termination of histamine
      iontophoresis in two phases: a first phase lasting 1-2 min in which the flare
      increased by about 10 mm2/s and a second phase lasting another 10-15 min
      characterized by a slower growth in the range of 1 mm2/s. CONCLUSIONS: Flare size
      was diminished in AE patients, mainly due to a slower or absent growth in the
      second phase. Oral application of the H1-antagonist cetirizine (Zyrtec) reduced
      the flare reaction in both groups of volunteers significantly, indicating that
      the reaction is dependent on the activation of chemosensitive nerve fibres via
      H1-receptors.

TI  - Corticosteroids significantly delay the onset of docetaxel-induced fluid
      retention: final results of a randomized study of the European Organization for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer Investigational Drug Branch for Breast Cancer.
PG  - 3149-55
AB  - PURPOSE: To confirm the efficacy of docetaxel in patients with breast cancer
      previously treated with one chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic
      disease and to compare the incidence of fluid retention (FR) and skin toxicity
      when docetaxel is administered with and without prophylactic corticosteroids.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients, pretreated with one chemotherapy
      regimen for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with bidimensionally measurable and
      progressive disease, were eligible for this randomized trial. Docetaxel with
      prophylactic oral antihistamine was administered at a dose of 50 mg/m2 as a
      1-hour infusion on days 1 and 8 every 21 days and patients were randomized to
      receive methylprednisolone (40 mg days -1, 0, 1, 7, 8, and 9 of each cycle) (arm 
      A) or no methylprednisolone (arm B). RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (34%, 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 23% to 45%) achieved on objective response. The median 
      time to disease progression and median overall survival time were 5 and 13.5
      months, respectively. In total, 415 cycles of docetaxel were administered (arm A:
      N = 219, median = six; arm B: N = 196, median = five). The most common toxicity
      observed was grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, which occurred in 79% of patients.
      Clinically significant nonhematologic side effects included skin reactions and
      asthenia. In an intent-to-treat analysis, patients who received
      methylprednisolone premedication had a delayed onset of FR (median time to onset 
      of FR: arm A, 84 days; arm B, 62 days; P = .01) and received a higher median
      cumulative dose of docetaxel before the onset of FR (arm A, 333 mg/m2; arm B, 215
      mg/m2; P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference in the
      incidence of skin toxicity between the two arms. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel, at this
      dose and schedule, has definite antitumor activity in pretreated MBC patients.
      Moreover, this is the first randomized trial to show that corticosteroids have a 
      favorable impact on docetaxel-induced FR.

TI  - Enantioselective pharmacokinetics of mefloquine during long-term intake of the
      prophylactic dose.
PG  - 119-24
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the kinetics of the (+)RS- and (-)SR-enantiomers and the
      carboxylic acid metabolite (MMQ) of the antimalarial drug mefloquine (MQ) in
      healthy volunteers. METHODS: Ten subjects of which three were poor metabolizers
      of debrisoquine received racemic MQ 250 mg once weekly for 16 weeks. The kinetics
      were followed in plasma and urine and evaluated by individual kinetic modelling
      as well as by a nonparametric population kinetic method. RESULTS: A
      two-compartment model adequately described the disposition of (+)RS-MQ. CL/F was 
      6.5 +/- 1.8 l h(-1), V(ss)/F 815 +/- 165 l, and k 0.0081 +/- 0.0023 h(-1). The
      kinetics of (-)SR-MQ were time- and/or concentration dependent with a lower oral 
      clearance (0.92 +/- 0.25 vs 2.14 +/- 0.63 l h(-1), 95% CI for the difference
      0.86-1.60 l h(-1)) and a longer half-life (345 vs 185 h, 95% CI for the
      difference 47-291 h) after the last dose compared with the first dose. Clearance 
      of (+)RS-MQ and (-)SR-MQ was significantly correlated within subjects (r = 0.69, 
      P < 0.05). Urinary recovery of unchanged substance was 8.7% for (+)RS-MQ and
      12.3% for (-)SR-MQ. The elimination of MMQ was disposition rate-limited and not
      determined by its rate of formation. Poor metabolizers of debrisoquine did not
      differ from extensive metabolizers in the kinetics of any compound. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The MQ enantiomers differ extensively in their disposition both with regard to
      parameter values and the kinetic stability over time during repeated dosing with 
      racemic MQ. Kinetic modelling of racemic MQ is therefore inadequate.

TI  - Cetirizine treatment of allergic cough in children with pollen allergy.
PG  - 752-4
AB  - Cetirizine, an antihistamine widely used in the treatment of allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis, also has antiallergic activity. The present study aimed to
      evaluate cetirizine as a treatment for children with allergic cough due to pollen
      allergy. This was a parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized 
      study. Twenty children with pollinosis were enrolled: they were subdivided into
      two groups receiving a 1-month treatment during the pollen season. The following 
      variables were monitored: 1) clinical symptoms and respiratory data (spirometry
      and PEF) evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study by allergists and by a
      daily diary card, and 2) pollen count. This study shows that cetirizine treatment
      reduces cough intensity (P < 0.05) and frequency (P < 0.01). In conclusion,
      cetirizine does clinically improve cough due to pollen allergy.

TI  - Effect of ebastine on mosquito bites.
PG  - 315-6
AB  - Mosquito bites usually cause wealing and delayed bite papules. Cetirizine
      decreases wealing, bite papules and pruritus but the effect of other
      antihistamines on mosquito bites is unknown. We studied the effect of ebastine in
      30 mosquito bite-sensitive adult subjects. Ebastine 10 mg or 20 mg and placebo
      were given for 4 days in a cross-over fashion. Aedes aegypti bites were given on 
      forearms. The size of the bite lesions and pruritus (visual analogue score) were 
      measured at 15 min, 2, 6, and 24 h after the bites. Twenty-five subjects were
      evaluable in the study. At 15 min ebastine decreased significantly the size of
      the bite lesion (p = 0.0017) and pruritus (p<0.0001). The effects of 10 mg and 20
      mg of ebastine were similar. No significant effect was found at 2, 6 or 24 h, but
      when the measurements at all four time points were compiled the size of the bite 
      lesion and pruritus score decreased significantly. Sedation occurred during
      ebastine treatment in 6 (21%) and during placebo treatment in 2 (7%) subjects.
      The present results show that prophylactically given ebastine is effective
      against immediate mosquito bite symptoms.

TI  - Drug interactions with the nonsedating antihistamines.
PG  - 223-31
AB  - The nonsedating antihistamines are frequently prescribed agents. Well-documented 
      drug-drug interactions with two of these agents, terfenadine and astemizole, may 
      result in serious adverse effects, including death, when they are prescribed
      along with macrolide antibiotics and/or the antifungal agents itraconazole or
      ketoconazole. Fexofenadine and loratadine appear to be the least likely
      nonsedating antihistamines to interact with other medications and to result in a 
      life-threatening interaction. This article reviews the known drug-drug
      interactions involving nonsedating antihistamines and provides a basis from which
      the clinician can predict potential interactions.

TI  - Comparison of intranasal triamcinolone acetonide with oral loratadine in the
      treatment of seasonal ragweed-induced allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 1052-8
AB  - A double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group controlled study compared
      the efficacy and safety of intranasal triamcinolone acetonide (220
      micrograms/day) and oral loratadine (10 mg/day) in patients with at least two
      seasons of ragweed-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis. A 28-day screening period,
      including a 5-day baseline period, preceded a 4-week treatment period. Reduction 
      in rhinitis symptom scores was evident in both groups as early as day 1, with no 
      significant between-group differences during week 1. At weeks 2, 3, and 4,
      patients treated with triamcinolone acetonide were significantly (P < 0.05) more 
      improved in total nasal score, nasal itch, nasal stuffiness, and sneezing than
      were patients treated with loratadine. At weeks 3 and 4, rhinorrhea and ocular
      symptoms were significantly (P < 0.05) more improved from baseline among
      triamcinolone acetonide patients compared with loratadine patients. There was no 
      significant between-group difference in relief from postnasal drip at any time
      point. Physicians' global evaluations significantly (P = 0.002) favored
      triamcinolone acetonide at the final visit, with moderate to complete relief of
      symptoms attained by 68% of triamcinolone acetonide patients and 59% of
      loratadine patients. Over the 4-week treatment period, triamcinolone acetonide
      patients had significantly greater improvement in total nasal score, nasal itch, 
      nasal stuffiness, sneezing, and ocular symptoms. Both treatments were well
      tolerated, with headache being the most frequently reported drug-related adverse 
      effect in both the triamcinolone acetonide (15%) and loratadine (11%) groups.
      These results indicate that triamcinolone acetonide is more effective than oral
      loratadine in relieving the symptoms of ragweed-induced seasonal allergic
      rhinitis.

TI  - Cetirizine and pseudoephedrine retard, given alone or in combination, in patients
      with seasonal allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 67-73
AB  - We compared the efficacy and safety of cetirizine (5 mg), pseudoephedrine retard 
      (120 mg), and the combination of cetirizine (5 mg) with pseudoephedrine retard
      (120 mg), each given twice daily for two weeks to subjects with pollen-associated
      allergic rhinitis. The study was multicentre and of randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group design. Five rhinitis symptoms were rated according to severity on
      a scale of 0 - 3, daily by patients and at each clinic visit by investigators. A 
      total of 687 patients, aged 9 - 66 years (mean: 32 years) was randomised to
      treatment (cetirizine: 231; pseudoephedrine: 226; combination: 230). On entry,
      the three groups were comparable in relevant respects. The primary outcome
      measure was based on the five symptoms assessed by the patients over the 2-week
      treatment period. The combination was more effective, providing at least 20% more
      "comfortable days" (symptoms absent or at most mild) than cetirizine or
      pseudoephedrine given alone (median values: 53.3%, 30.8%, and 33.3%,
      respectively; p < 0.001). For nasal obstruction, the combination (mean score:
      1.19) was more effective than cetirizine (mean score: 1.43; p = 0.0005), but
      there was little difference between the combination and pseudoephedrine (mean
      score: 1.22; not significant). Sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal and ocular pruritus
      were better controlled by combination (mean 4-symptom score: 0.77) than by
      pseudoephedrine alone (mean 4-symptom score: 1.12; p < 0.001) and also better
      than by cetirizine alone (mean 4-symptom score: 0.93; p < 0.001). No unexpected
      adverse reactions were observed. A combination of cetirizine and pseudoephedrine 
      retard is well tolerated and superior to each given alone for moderate to severe 
      allergic seasonal rhinitis, especially when nasal obstruction is a predominant
      symptom.

TI  - Adjunct effect of loratadine in the treatment of acute sinusitis in patients with
      allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 650-5
AB  - H1-blockers are often added to the standard treatment of acute sinusitis, but
      this is not supported by a controlled study. A multicentric, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was done in 139 allergic
      patients (15-65 years) to assess the adjunct efficacy of loratadine in acute
      exacerbation of rhinosinusitis. Sinusitis was diagnosed by symptoms and confirmed
      by rhinoscopy and sinus radiograph. Allergy was characterized by skin tests,
      RAST, and history. Patients were treated with antibiotics (14 days), oral
      corticosteroids (10 days), and loratadine (10 mg OD) or placebo (28 days).
      Treatment efficacy was assessed over 28 days by symptom scores quoted daily by
      patients. Physicians also rated total symptom scores at entry and at day 28. At
      entry, both groups had similar symptoms. Placebo-treated patients improved
      significantly, but patients who received loratadine had a significantly greater
      improvement in sneezing (P = 0.003) after 14 days, and in nasal obstruction (P = 
      0.002) after 28 days. Physicians found that patients receiving loratadine were
      significantly improved compared to placebo patients (P = 0.0125). Loratadine in
      addition to standard therapy was found to improve the control of some symptoms of
      sinusitis.

TI  - Clarithromycin. A review of its efficacy in the treatment of respiratory tract
      infections in immunocompetent patients.
PG  - 973-1004
AB  - Clarithromycin is a broad spectrum macrolide antibacterial agent active in vitro 
      and effective in vivo against the major pathogens responsible for respiratory
      tract infections in immunocompetent patients. It is highly active in vitro
      against pathogens causing atypical pneumonia (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma
      pneumoniae and Legionella spp.) and has similar activity to other macrolides
      against Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis and 
      Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae is susceptible or intermediately
      susceptible to clarithromycin alone, but activity is enhanced when the parent
      drug and metabolite are combined in vitro. Absorption of clarithromycin is
      unaffected by food. More than half of an oral dose is systemically available as
      the parent drug and the active 14-hydroxy metabolite. Pharmacokinetics are
      nonlinear, with plasma concentrations increasing in more than proportion to the
      dosage. First-pass metabolism results in the rapid appearance of the active
      metabolite 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin in plasma. Clarithromycin and its active
      metabolite are found in greater concentrations in the tissues and fluids of the
      respiratory tract than in plasma. Dosage adjustments are required for patients
      with severe renal failure, but not for elderly patients or those with hepatic
      impairment. Drug interactions related to the cytochrome P450 system may occur
      with clarithromycin use. In addition to the standard immediate-release
      formulation for administration twice daily, a modified-release formulation of
      clarithromycin is now available for use once daily. In dosages of 500 to 1000
      mg/day for 5 to 14 days, clarithromycin was as effective in the treatment of
      community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections in hospital and
      community settings as beta-lactam agents (with or without a beta-lactamase
      inhibitor), cephalosporins and most other macrolides. Clarithromycin was similar 
      in efficacy to azithromycin in comparative studies and is as effective as and
      better tolerated than erythromycin. Adverse events are primarily gastrointestinal
      in nature, but result in fewer withdrawals from therapy than are seen with
      erythromycin. Clarithromycin provides similar clinical and bacteriological
      efficacy to that seen with beta-lactam agents, cephalosporins and other
      macrolides. It offers a cost-saving alternative to intravenous erythromycin use
      in US hospitals and is available in both once-daily and twice-daily formulations.
      The spectrum of activity of clarithromycin against common and emerging
      respiratory tract pathogens may make it suitable for use in the community as
      empirical therapy of respiratory tract infections in both children and adults.

TI  - Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray compared with oral loratadine in
      patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 445-50
AB  - The effectiveness and safety of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200
      micrograms once daily for 4 weeks) were compared with those of loratadine (10 mg 
      once daily for 4 weeks) in 114 adults and adolescents with seasonal allergic
      rhinitis in this multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized,
      parallel-group study. Patients recorded their nasal symptoms (nighttime and
      daytime obstruction, sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and overall discomfort) using
      a 4-point scale (0 = no symptoms, 3 = very frequent symptoms) in daily diaries.
      Clinicians assessed patients' nasal symptoms (nighttime and daytime obstruction, 
      sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea) using a 4-point scale at every scheduled
      visit. Clinicians and patients assessed the overall effectiveness of treatment at
      the end of the study. Fluticasone propionate improved clinician-rated total nasal
      symptom scores (defined as the sum of five nasal symptoms) more than loratadine
      at the 2-week and 4-week assessments (P < or = 0.008). Clinicians give
      fluticasone propionate better global ratings than loratadine (P = 0.04). After 4 
      weeks of treatment, between-group differences in clinician-rated individual nasal
      symptoms favored fluticasone propionate (P < 0.05), with the exception of nasal
      itching (P = 0.11). These findings were confirmed by between-group differences in
      the percentages of symptom-free days calculated from patient-recorded daily
      diary-card data. Both treatments were well tolerated. The incidence of adverse
      events between groups was similar. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray 200
      micrograms administered once daily in the morning was more effective than
      loratadine 10 mg administered once daily for the treatment of seasonal allergic
      rhinitis.

TI  - Can an antihistamine delay appearance of hay fever symptoms when given prior to
      pollen season?
PG  - 440-4
AB  - Mizolastine is a new, nonsedating antihistamine providing satisfactory symptom
      relief in allergic conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
      the onset of hay fever symptoms could be delayed in patients known to suffer
      seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms if mizolastine was given before
      the pollen season. This double-blind study involved 342 patients, randomly
      allocated to once-daily 10 mg mizolastine (n = 115), once-daily 120 mg
      terfenadine (n = 116), or placebo (n = 111) groups. All patients started
      treatment on 1 May, before the onset of the grass pollen season. The prophylactic
      effect of test drugs was assessed on their ability to delay the time to the first
      hay fever crisis of the season, which was defined by the occurrence of one of the
      following events: use of rescue medication, study withdrawal because of treatment
      failure, or total diary symptom score over 18. Active treatments prolonged the
      time to the first crisis by approximately 1 week (mizolastine 55 days,
      terfenadine 57 days) in comparison with placebo (50 days) (survival curve
      analysis: Logrank test, P = 0.01; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.03). Tolerability was
      satisfactory and comparable between groups. Thus, mizolastine can be safely used 
      to delay and to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Once-daily cetirizine effective in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in
      children aged 6 to 11 years: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study.
PG  - 209-15
AB  - Cetirizine (once daily), a highly selective H1-antagonist, is efficacious for
      treating seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), perennial allergic rhinitis, and
      chronic idiopathic urticaria. A 4-week, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial investigated the safety and efficacy of cetirizine syrup
      (5 or 10 mg daily) in 209 children ages 6 to 11 years with SAR. Parents assisted 
      patients in recording symptom severity (sneezing, nasal discharge, itchy eyes,
      itchy nose or mouth, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion) daily. A total symptom
      severity (TSS) score was derived from all symptoms, excluding nasal congestion.
      At baseline, TSS was comparable for all groups (range 6.8-7.0). Cetirizine 10 mg 
      produced a significantly greater mean TSS reduction (3.2) than placebo (P < 0.05)
      over the treatment period. Cetirizine 5 mg once daily produced mean reductions in
      weekly symptom scores of 2.4; this did not differ statistically from placebo.
      Furthermore, cetirizine 10 mg significantly improved symptoms of itchy eyes,
      nose, or mouth. The most commonly reported adverse reactions to both cetirizine
      and placebo were headache, pharyngitis, and abdominal pain, which did not occur
      with an incidence statistically different from that of placebo. Once-daily
      cetirizine is safe for treating SAR in children ages 6-11 years. Once-daily
      cetirizine 10 mg provides effective improvement in symptoms and is well
      tolerated.

TI  - Pregnancy outcome following first trimester exposure to antihistamines:
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 119-24
AB  - To determine the relative risk for major malformations associated with
      antihistamine (H1 blockers) exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy, a
      literature search of all studies examining the association between antihistamines
      and major malformations for the period 1960 to 1991 was conducted, followed by
      meta-analysis. Odds ratio was calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method.
      Twenty-four controlled studies met the inclusion criteria with more than 200,000 
      participating women. The summary odds ratio of major malformations associated
      with antihistamines taken during the first trimester was 0.76 (95% CI:
      0.60-0.94). This analysis indicates that H1 blockers used mainly for morning
      sickness during the first trimester do not increase the teratogenic risk in
      humans and may, in fact, be associated with a protective effect. More study is
      needed to verify the possibility that by preventing vomiting, antihistamines may 
      ensure better metabolic conditions to the fetus and thus may reduce some birth
      defects. Alternatively, it is possible that pregnancies characterized by vomiting
      are associated with better outcome due to other reasons, such as hormonal status 
      or placental function. Women suffering from morning sickness which is not
      controlled by nonpharmacological methods can safely use antihistamines.

TI  - Onset of action in the nasal antihistaminic effect of cetirizine and loratadine
      in patients with allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 205-9
AB  - Several studies have compared the cutaneous efficacy of cetirizine and loratadine
      and their onset of action. We assessed the nasal effect of these two
      antihistamines in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial
      in order to compare objectively their efficacy and onset of action in the noses
      of patients with allergic rhinitis. Nasal challenge was performed by nebulization
      of increasing doubling doses of histamine (0, 0.04-1.28 mg/nostril) in 12
      patients (eight men, four women, aged 22-39 years). Nasal airway resistance (NAR)
      was measured by posterior rhinomanometry either 1.5 h or 4 h after intake of
      cetirizine (10 mg), loratadine (10 mg), or placebo. Baseline NAR was identical
      between all study days (2.60-2.88 cmH2O.l-1.s). One and a half hours after
      intake, the increase in NAR induced by histamine was significantly reduced by
      both cetirizine and loratadine in contrast to placebo. However, with cetirizine
      the nasal obstruction was significantly lower than with loratadine (P < 0.05).
      Four hours after intake, a similar inhibition of the nasal obstruction caused by 
      histamine was observed with both cetirizine and loratadine (P < 0.05). In
      conclusion, this study found cetirizine and loratadine to have similar nasal
      efficacy at therapeutic dosage 4 h after intake, whereas cetirizine was more
      effective than loratadine 1.5 h after intake. In agreement with the results
      observed in the skin, our study suggests a more rapid onset of action of
      cetirizine in the nose in allergic rhinitis.

PG  - 55-66
AB  - Antihistamines were investigated for use in asthma shortly after discovery over
      fifty years ago. Earlier compounds proved ineffective because of side effects:
      this class of drugs was not thought useful for asthma, and were actually
      considered contraindicated. More recent drugs have greater potency, fewer
      side-effects, and no evidence of adverse effects in asthma. There are some
      studies showing second generation antihistamines, especially cetirizine, improve 
      certain parameters of asthma.

TI  - Effects of a single dose of loratadine on flying ability under conditions of
      simulated cabin pressure.
PG  - 27-33
AB  - Pilots with allergic diseases, who need antihistaminic drug therapy, have to be
      grounded temporarily because this therapy is considered to interfere with flight 
      safety due to its sedative effects. There is evidence that loratadine is
      practically void of these sedative effects, and therefore might be prescribed to 
      pilots. A study was conducted to determine the effects of loratadine on
      performance and alertness. In a randomized, double-blind, within subjects design,
      18 male subjects were studied, employing loratadine 10 mg, triprolidine
      hydrochloride 5 mg, and placebo. Objective (vigilance, complex tasks) and
      subjective tests, tailored to the specific tasks of aircrew, were applied under
      hypobaric conditions that prevail in an intact cockpit. With respect to alertness
      and performance, the results of this study showed no significant differences
      between loratadine and placebo during a period of 1 to 6 hours after drug
      ingestion. Triprolidine, used as a positive control, showed significant
      detrimental effects on both subjective and objective measures. It is anticipated 
      that a single dose of loratadine 10 mg will not affect flying performance. This
      finding might also have implications for the treatment of allergic disorders of
      personnel involved in other highly skilled jobs.

PG  - 330-2
AB  - When comparing the fate of a drug in the body with the location of its receptors,
      it appears that a large amount of the administered dosage will never reach these 
      receptors. Thus this large amount is useless in terms of drug efficacy whereas it
      may generate side of toxic effects in other tissues. An attempt to optimize drug 
      distribution is to limit or even to suppress its useless localisations. This is
      possible with H1 antagonists as these drugs develop benefic effects in organs
      which are distinct from those where toxic effects may occur. Cetirizine is an
      example of choice of this strategy. It is poorly distributed into tissues,
      especially in heart and liver which favors preferential binding at its target H1 
      selected receptors.

TI  - Sedation in allergic rhinitis is caused by the condition and not by antihistamine
      treatment.
PG  - 893-906
AB  - Sedation is regarded as a common side-effect of most H1-antihistamines. This view
      must be accepted, yet can hardly be assessed under treatment of allergic
      disorders. Since central sedative potency is hard to evaluate, different methods 
      of measurement have been introduced in the four phases of clinical investigation.
      While tests of high complexity in early trials can detect true central effects,
      they seem to have the disadvantage of not taking into consideration the important
      interactions of drugs with the disorder. Therefore, we used a visual analog scale
      (VAS) as an instrument to demonstrate sedative effects in five clinical studies
      carried out between 1989 and 1994 with a total number of 1070 patients. Thereby, 
      we could assess the result of the different components of the central
      interaction. In 1989, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we could show 
      that the vigilance of patients suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis
      increased significantly more under treatment with an antihistamine (mizolastine) 
      than under placebo. From 1992 until 1994, we compared azelastine nasal spray
      either by the double-dummy technique with oral antihistamines (cetirizine,
      loratadine, and astemizole) or by the double-dummy or placebo-controlled design
      with monotherapy or combined therapy with azelastine tablets. A marked or
      statistically significant improvement of vigilance was found for all compounds
      (loratadine: P < 0.0001; cetirizine: P < 0.0254; and azelastine nasal spray: P < 
      0.1409 to P < 0.0001). Even when taking azelastine as oral application, patients,
      in spite of the warning, reported a similar increase in vigilance (P < 0.2628 to 
      P < 0.0001). Finally, we assessed the range of physiologic vigilance using the
      same VAS in healthy volunteers. In conclusion, we could prove that in all trials 
      the baseline values of vigilance of untreated symptomatic patients were far below
      physiologic condition and improved under treatment to the upper range of healthy 
      persons. Therefore, any sedative properties of modern H1-antihistamines should
      not limit their therapeutic use, since the truly threatening sedation results
      from the disorder itself.

TI  - Sinusitis in children and adolescents.
PG  - 701-17
AB  - Sinusitis is common in children and adolescents, most frequently as a
      complication of a viral upper respiratory tract infection or allergic rhinitis.
      The diagnosis usually is suggested by symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract
      infection persisting beyond 10 days without improvement or severe symptoms with
      fever and purulent rhinitis. Young children frequently do not have the symptoms
      (headache) or physical findings (sinus tenderness) seen in older patients.
      Radiographic evaluation may be helpful if the clinical presentation is atypical
      or severe. Antibiotics remain the primary therapeutic agent of choice in
      pediatric sinusitis, with other therapeutic modalities having little proven
      efficacy.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of astemizole-D and Loratadine-D during prolonged,
      controlled allergen challenge in the Vienna Challenge Chamber.
PG  - 1077-81
AB  - This randomized, double-blind, single-dummy, cross-over trial was initiated to
      compare the efficacy and tolerability of once-daily astemizole-D (CAS
      141623-30-5; 10 mg astemizole/240 mg pseudoephedrine) with twice-daily loratadine
      D (CAS 132316-36-0; 5 mg loratadine/120 mg pseudoephedrine) during prolonged,
      controlled allergen challenge in the Vienna Challenge Chamber. Twelve atopic
      patients participated in this study with a treatment duration of 3 days. Pollen
      challenges were made on days 1 and 3: the first to assess onset of drug action;
      the second to determine duration of drug effect. Drug efficacy was assessed using
      a number of standard objective and subjective measures. Onset of action was found
      to be generally comparable in both treatment groups for all parameters tested
      with a mean overall onset of action of 65 min during treatment with astemizole-D 
      compared with 70 min on loratadine-D. As expected, astemizole-D tended to have a 
      longer duration of action, with symptom severity lower with this agent than with 
      loratadine-D during the second challenge session despite the differences in
      dosing schedule. However, inter-group differences did not attain statistical
      significance. Patient evaluations of therapeutic efficacy confirm these findings.
      Both drugs were well-tolerated, although a non-significant trend towards greater 
      sleep impairment was seen during treatment with loratadine-D. In conclusion,
      astemizole-D was shown to be at least as effective and well tolerated as
      loratadine-D for the treatment of allergen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis during
      prolonged, controlled allergen challenge.

AB  - The effect of a high-fat breakfast on the bioavailability of the components of an
      extended-release tablet containing 10 mg loratadine in the immediate-release
      coating and 240 mg pseudoephedrine sulfate in the extended-release core was
      studied in 24 healthy male volunteers in a single-dose, two-way crossover study. 
      The drug was administered after a 10-hour overnight fast or within 5 minutes of
      consuming a standardized high-fat breakfast. Serial blood samples were collected 
      over a 48-hour period, and plasma was analyzed for loratadine and its active
      metabolite descarboethoxyloratadine (DCL), and pseudoephedrine. For
      pseudoephedrine, maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the
      concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCzero-infinity) were similar
      after both treatments, indicating no relevant food effect on the bioavailability 
      of pseudoephedrine. Also, the absorption profiles of pseudoephedrine (from
      Wagner-Nelson analysis) were similar for the fed and fasted treatments,
      indicating no apparent differences in absorption. Plasma concentration-time
      profiles and values for Cmax and AUCzero-infinity of DCL were similar for the two
      treatments, indicating no relevant food effect on the pharmacokinetics of DCL. In
      contrast, for loratadine, administration with food resulted in a significantly
      increased mean Cmax (53%) and AUC from time zero to the final quantifiable sample
      (AUCif) (76%). However, the resultant Cmax and AUC of loratadine under fed
      conditions were well below those previously obtained at steady-state after
      multiple-dose administration of loratadine (40 mg/day) that were shown to be safe
      and well-tolerated in several clinical studies. The effect of food on the
      bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles of the components of a combination
      loratadine/pseudoephedrine extended-release tablet is not likely to be clinically
      significant.

TI  - The effect of cetirizine and loratadine on codeine-induced histamine release in
      human skin in vivo assessed by cutaneous microdialysis.
PG  - 486-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: To determine whether or not cetirizine and loratadine
      inhibit codeine- induced histamine release in human skin in vivo, we conducted a 
      placebo-controlled double-blind trial in which histamine release was assessed by 
      dermal microdialysis. SUBJECTS: A group of ten normal volunteers were studied,
      each subject visiting the laboratory on three occasions with intervals of at
      least 2 weeks between visits. TREATMENT: Cetirizine, loratadine (both 10 mg) or
      placebo was given orally 4 h before provocation of weal and flare responses in
      the skin by intradermal injection of 25 microliters of 3 or 10 mg/ml codeine 1 mm
      from the centre of individual 216 microns diameter microdialysis fibres inserted 
      in the dermis. METHODS: Dialysate was collected at 2 min intervals for 4 min
      before and 20 min after codeine injection and histamine assayed
      spectrofluorometrically. Weal and flare responses to codeine were assessed in the
      opposite arm. RESULTS: Histamine concentrations in the microdialysis fibre
      outflow with 3 and 10 mg/ml codeine were maximal at 2-4 min when 910 +/- 156 and 
      1194 +/- 304 nM respectively were found in the placebo group. Cetirizine and
      loratadine did not modify either the kinetics or total histamine release while
      significantly (p < 0.01) inhibiting weal and flare responses. CONCLUSIONS:
      Neither cetirizine nor loratadine inhibited codeine-induced histamine release or 
      modified the time course of its release in human skin in vivo when given in
      clinically used doses which are sufficient to significantly reduce weal and flare
      responses.

TI  - Treating allergic rhinitis with second-generation antihistamines.
PG  - 905-14
AB  - Allergic rhinitis afflicts close to 40% of the nation's population and costs more
      than $1.8 billion a year. The toll exacted by this disorder has been greatly
      alleviated by nonsedating second-generation antihistamines loratadine,
      terfenadine, and astemizole. The three agents effectively reduce symptoms without
      the sometimes intolerable adverse effects of older drugs, but they are not
      completely equivalent. For example, terfenadine requires twice/day dosing,
      whereas the others can be given once/day. Astemizole has a slow onset and
      extremely prolonged duration of action. Both terfenadine and astemizole may have 
      cardiotoxic effects (e.g., torsades de pointes) when serum concentrations rise
      due to overdosing or drug interactions. Cetirizine, a recently approved
      second-generation antihistamine, has sedative and anticholinergic effects,
      although to a lesser degree than the first-generation antihistamines.

TI  - The contribution of histamine to the action of bradykinin in the human nasal
      airway.
PG  - 181-9
AB  - Bradykinin, 10 to 1000 micrograms given by aerosol into the nasal cavity of
      normal, healthy volunteers, produced a dose-related increase of nasal airway
      resistance. Bradykinin also reduced the minimal nasal cross-sectional area
      (Amin), increased albumin release into nasal lavage fluid and increased the
      symptoms of nasal inflammation. Pretreatment with cetirizine (10 mg orally)
      reduced the fall in Amin induced by bradykinin, 300 micrograms, but not by
      bradykinin, 100 micrograms. Pre-treatment of the subjects with the H1 histamine
      receptor antgonist cetirizine (10 mg, orally) or terfenadine (60 mg, orally) 3 h 
      before bradykinin administration caused significant reduction of the
      bradykinin-induced increase in nasal airway resistance in the upper range of
      bradykinin doses (300-1000 micrograms) but not in the lower range (10-100
      micrograms). Cetirizine reduced the albumin release into the nasal airway and the
      symptoms induced by bradykinin, 1000 micrograms. Following nasal challenge with
      bradykinin 300 micrograms or 1000 micrograms, no increase could be detected in
      the histamine content of nasal lavage fluid. Isolated human nasal cells released 
      histamine in response to bradykinin, 33 and 100 microM, anti-IgE and calcium
      ionophore, A23187. We conclude that the actions of bradykinin in the human nasal 
      airway are, in part, accounted for by the release of histamine.

PG  - 887-90
AB  - The effects of dimethindene maleate (CAS 3614-69-5) on the central nervous
      system-as sustained release pellets (Fenistil OAD; OAD = once a day) and
      sustained release tablets (Fenistil retard) with an immediate release
      fraction-were investigated by means of the oculodynamic test (ODT) and visual
      analogue scales and compared to loratadine (CAS 79794-75-5) and placebo. In the
      confirmatory part of the study 18 healthy volunteers were included in a
      single-blind, randomised, 3-way change-over design with Fenistil OAD, loratadine,
      and placebo. An additional, fourth exploratory arm with Fenistil retard was run
      in 6 (out of the 18) subjects after completing the main part of the study. The
      ODT includes electro-oculography, choice reaction task, and cardiologic
      parameters under workload. Visual analogue scales were used for subjective
      ratings on well-being and drug effects concerning wakefulness (sedation),
      excitation, dizziness, performance, effort, and dry mouth. The results show no
      relevant differences between either of the active drugs and placebo. Therefore it
      can be stated that after a single dose there is no sedating effect of
      dimethindene maleate compared to loratadine or placebo.

TI  - Safety of antihistamines in the treatment of allergic rhinitis in elderly
      patients.
PG  - 464-8
AB  - Elderly patients may be more susceptible than younger persons to the sedating and
      anticholinergic effects of first-generation antihistamines. Second-generation
      antihistamines, such as loratadine, astemizole, and terfenadine, cause minimal
      sedation and little if any impairment in cognitive and psychomotor activity in
      healthy nonelderly patients. Although less extensively studied in elderly
      patients, it is probable that second-generation antihistamines are also less
      likely to induce the adverse central nervous system effects in older patients
      that are characteristic of the first-generation antihistamines. Toxic effects to 
      the cardiovascular system, an issue of greater concern among elderly patients who
      may have subclinical heart disease, has not been observed with first-generation
      antihistamines. Among the second-generation antihistamines, however, astemizole
      and terfenadine, but not loratadine, can cause serious cardiovascular adverse
      effects, including death, when taken in high doses or coadministered with
      ketoconazole, itraconazole, or macrolide antibiotics.

TI  - Once-daily mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray (Nasonex) in seasonal allergic 
      rhinitis: an active- and placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 569-76
AB  - Mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray (Nasonex) was compared with beclomethasone
      dipropionate (BDP) aqueous nasal spray in a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-dummy, parallel-group study of adults with moderate to
      severe seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients allergic to at least one tree and/or 
      grass aeroallergen received one of the following regimens for up to 4 weeks;
      mometasone furoate 100 micrograms once daily [OD] (n = 126) or 200 micrograms OD 
      (n = 126), BDP 200 micrograms twice daily (n = 126), or only placebo spray (n =
      123). Physician-rated nasal and total symptom scores, and global evaluation of
      overall condition and therapeutic response by physicians and patients, showed
      that the three active treatments were equally effective, and all three were
      significantly superior to placebo at most time points. Overall, mometasone
      furoate 200 micrograms OD demonstrated somewhat greater numerical, but not
      statistical, superiority to mometasone furoate 100 micrograms OD at the earliest 
      evaluation time point. At the end of treatment, complete or marked relief was
      obtained in 77% of patients with mometasone furoate 100 micrograms/day, 79% with 
      mometasone furoate 200 micrograms/day, and 74% with BDP, compared with 54% of
      placebo vehicle control patients. Mometasone furoate and BDP were equally well
      tolerated. It was concluded that mometasone furoate adequately controls symptoms 
      of moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhinitis, offers the advantage of OD
      treatment, and is well tolerated.

TI  - Effect of loratadine, an H1 antihistamine, on induced cough in non-asthmatic
      patients with chronic cough.
PG  - 810-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: H1 antihistamines have been shown to have an antitussive effect in
      patients with asthma, postnasal drip, and allergic rhinitis. No study has been
      performed to determine whether orally administered H1 antihistamines can reduce
      the number of coughs induced by stimulation of cough receptors in non-asthmatic
      patients with chronic dry cough. METHODS: The effect of loratadine (10 mg) on the
      number of coughs induced by ultrasonically nebulised distilled water (UNDW) was
      examined in 10 patients with nasal disease and in seven patients with unexplained
      chronic cough using a randomised, double blind crossover method. Eleven normal
      volunteers were also studied. Each subject inhaled UNDW for one minute, and the
      numbers of coughs during the one minute inhalation and the 30 seconds following
      it were counted. RESULTS: There was no difference in the results of pulmonary
      function tests performed before and one minute after UNDW inhalation for either
      patients or normal subjects. There was also no significant difference between the
      results of pulmonary function tests before or after oral administration of
      loratadine. Loratadine significantly reduced the number of coughs in patients
      with nasal disease and in those with unexplained chronic cough, but not in normal
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The H1 antihistamine loratadine reduces cough induced by
      UNDW. The release of histamine may contribute to the chronic cough in patients
      with unexplained chronic cough or nasal disease.

TI  - Acute urticaria: clinical aspects and therapeutic responsiveness.
PG  - 295-7
AB  - Although acute urticaria is common, its eliciting factors, clinical course and
      therapeutic responsiveness have not been intensively investigated. We have
      therefore prospectively studied all patients with acute urticaria attending the
      department of dermatology (n = 72) and a rural dermatology office (n = 37) during
      the course of 1 year. After a standardized history and physical examination,
      patients were randomized into treatment with either loratadine (10 mg/day for 3
      days) or prednisolene (50 mg/day for 3 days). All patients were followed up until
      complete remission. Most patients suffered from moderate (42%) to severe (40%)
      disease. Possible eliciting factors were identified in less than 50% of the
      cases. Associated upper respiratory tract infections were found most commonly
      (39.5%), followed by possibly eliciting drugs, mostly analgesics (9.2%) and
      suspected food intolerance (0.9%). The course of the disease was self-limited in 
      all cases, the longest episode lasting for 3 weeks. Both treatment regimens were 
      effective in controlling whealing, but in corticosteroid-treated patients,
      symptoms ceased earlier, with complete remission occurring within 3 days of
      treatment in 93.8%, compared to 65.9% of patients treated with loratadine (p <
      0.001). Acute urticaria is thus frequently idiopathic and only rarely associated 
      with IgE-mediated events. It is, however, largely self-limited, with prompt
      response to symptomatic treatment.

AB  - Total skin examination during public screening for malignant melanoma is often
      advocated, but the benefit of this approach has not been established properly. We
      assessed the yield of examination of the entire skin, in addition to examination 
      of intentionally shown skin lesions, in people attending melanoma screening
      clinics in southern Limburg, the Netherlands, in 1993. Of the 4146 attenders,
      2910 (70%) showed a specific skin spot. Additional examination of the entire skin
      was offered to 1385 people. There were 1221 evaluable cases. Fourteen presumptive
      diagnoses of malignancies were encountered: seven malignant melanomas, all with
      low clinical suspicion, and seven basal cell carcinomas. Histology revealed three
      basal cell carcinomas. No malignant melanomas were confirmed by histology. It is 
      concluded that additional total skin examination during screening for malignant
      melanoma is not worthwhile, except perhaps for persons presenting lesions that
      are suspicious of melanoma or dysplastic naevi.

TI  - Comparison of mizolastine with loratadine in the treatment of perennial allergic 
      rhinitis.
PG  - 101-4
AB  - Mizolastine is a new, non-sedating antihistamine providing satisfactory
      symptomatic relief in seasonal allergic rhinitis. The purpose of this study has
      been to compare mizolastine to loratadine in perennial allergic rhinitis. This
      multicentre, double-blind study has involved 68 patients, randomly allocated,
      after a one-week placebo run-in, to 10 mg mizolastine or 10 mg loratadine, both
      given on a once-daily basis, for four weeks. Comparable symptom relief occurs in 
      both groups resulting, respectively for mizolastine and loratadine, in a 66.6%
      and a 61.3% decrease in total nasal score, to a 74.8% and a 76.4% decrease in
      total ocular score, and to a 69.0% and a 64.8% decrease in global total score.
      Safety is satisfactory in both groups. Mizolastine is at least as effective as
      loratadine in relieving perennial allergic rhinitis symptoms and its safety
      profile allows its use in the treatment of this disease.

TI  - Cetirizine and pseudoephedrine retard alone and in combination in the treatment
      of perennial allergic rhinitis: a double-blind multicentre study.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - We compared the efficacy and safety of 5 mg cetirizine (CTZ), 120 mg
      pseudoephedrine retard (PER) and their combination (COM), given twice daily for
      three weeks, for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis. Two hundred and
      ten evaluable patients (97 males and 113 females) were included in the study and 
      randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups, each of 70 patients. Nasal
      obstruction, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal and ocular pruritus were scored each
      day throughout the study by patients using a symptom scale ranging from 0 (no
      symptom) to 3 (severe). The mean proportion of days without symptoms was higher
      in the COM group (11.8%) than in the CTZ (6.8%) and PER (5.1%) groups, but the
      differences were not statistically significant. The mean percentage of days when 
      symptoms were absent or at most mild was significantly higher in the COM group
      (64.8%) than in either CTZ (45.5%; p = 0.003) or PER groups (40.6%; p = 0.0001). 
      In addition, evaluation of symptoms by investigators and their global evaluation 
      at the end of treatment showed statistically significant differences in favour of
      COM compared, to both CTZ and PER. The most frequent adverse events were
      somnolence in the CTZ and COM groups (8.6% and 12.9%, respectively) while
      insomnia was most frequent in the PER group. No clinically significant
      abnormalities were found in haematological or biochemical tests. These results
      indicate that the combined treatment was more effective than and as well
      tolerated as treatment with each individual agent.

      of sedation in man.
PG  - 33-41
AB  - The cutaneous antihistaminic action (prick test; 1:100, 1:200 and 1:1000) and
      neuropsychological and electroencephalographic (EEG) concomitants of sedation
      following the histamine H1 receptor antagonist cetirizine (10- and 20-mg acute
      oral doses) and chlorpheniramine, 4 mg, were investigated in a cross-over,
      placebo-controlled study in healthy male volunteers (age 23-29 years). With an
      average Cmax of cetirizine of 697.0 ng/ml (10 mg) and 1000.2 ng/ml (20 mg), the
      diameter of histamine-induced skin weals was reduced by 24.0-74.9% depending on
      histamine concentration and with no dose dependence for cetirizine. Placebo and
      chlorpheniramine were ineffective. Behavioral or neuropsychological signs of
      sedation were never observed. An increase of the 6.5-14.5 Hz EEG power, with
      anterior scalp preponderance, was observed after chlorpheniramine or cetirizine
      20 mg. This effect of cetirizine was accounted for by a substantial increase of
      power in the 6.5-8.0 Hz frequency subsegment and is regarded, for these
      experimental conditions, as an established early EEG indication of mild sedation 
      (vigilance 'state A'). No EEG effects were observed after placebo or cetirizine
      at the 10 mg dose. The existence of some histaminergic (H1) specificity of the
      mechanisms modulating vigilance and of a threshold dose of cetirizine for
      sedative action is suggested.

TI  - Pachydermatous eosinophilic dermatitis.
PG  - 469-74
AB  - We report three South African black teenage girls with extensive pruritic papular
      lesions arising on a pachydermatous base, resembling severe atopic dermatitis or 
      onchodermatitis. All three had peculiar hypertrophic genital lesions and
      peripheral blood eosinophilia. Histological studies showed an eosinophil-rich
      lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and variable fibrosis. Extensive fibrillar
      extracellular deposition of eosinophil granule major basic protein was
      demonstrated by an indirect immunofluorescence technique. A beneficial
      therapeutic effect was obtained using dapsone, prednisolone and cetirizine. The
      term pachydermatous eosinophilic dermatitis is proposed and its position among
      other conditions characterized by peripheral blood and skin tissue eosinophilia, 
      is discussed.

TI  - Effects of loratadine and terfenadine on the induced nasal allergic reaction.
PG  - 309-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of terfenadine and loratadine on the early
      nasal allergic response to challenge and the subsequent cellular influx and
      hyperresponsiveness. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, triple-crossover
      study. SUBJECTS: Fourteen, asymptomatic, allergic volunteers. INTERVENTIONS:
      After an initial challenge with methacholine chloride, subjects received
      treatment with placebo, loratadine (10 mg by mouth daily), or terfenadine (60 mg 
      by mouth twice daily) for 1 week, followed by a nasal allergen challenge with
      lavages; 24 hours later, while the subjects were still receiving medication, the 
      quantity of cells in the nasal lavage was determined, and another challenge with 
      methacholine was done. Mediator levels were quantified in the nasal lavages after
      the allergen c hallenge, and the weight of the methacholine-induced nasal
      secretions was measured. RESULTS: Both loratadine and terfenadine treatment
      resulted in significant reductions in allergen-induced sneezing and the levels of
      histamine, kinins, albumin, and N-alpha-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester-esterase
      activity in recovered nasal lavages compared with the reductions that resulted
      from placebo treatment, with no significant difference among the treatments.
      Treatment had no effect on the levels of tryptase, prostaglandin D2 or
      leukotriene C4. A significant eosinophil influx into nasal secretions 24 hours
      after the allergen challenge in patients who were receiving placebo (P=.006) was 
      not affected by loratidine or terfenadine treatment. Comparing
      methacholine-induced secretions between screening challenges and challenges with 
      the patients who were being treated with either loratadine or terfenadine, there 
      was a significant decrease in secretions after the use of these antihistamines
      (P<.05). CONCLUSION: Both loratadine and terfenadine partially inhibit the early 
      nasal response to allergen challenge and the subsequent reactivity to a challenge
      with methacholine without affecting the influx of eosinophils into nasal
      secretions.

TI  - Double-blind crossover study of high-dose cetirizine in cholinergic urticaria.
PG  - 324-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholinergic urticaria does not respond well to treatment with
      conventional antihistamines and is difficult to study because of its highly
      variable clinical expression which depends on the presence of eliciting factors. 
      OBJECTIVE: We have therefore designed a double-blind, crossover,
      placebo-controlled trial, with a 3-week treatment period using either 20 mg/day
      of cetirizine or placebo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Presence of eliciting factors and 
      symptoms were scored daily on a diary card by the patient, with a scale from 0 to
      3 for erythema, wheals and pruritus. Statistical analysis was done on 11
      evaluable patients during the last 2 weeks of each treatment period (to allow for
      1 week of washout) and only for days when eliciting factors were present.
      Compared to placebo, cetirizine caused a statistically significant reduction of
      wheals (p = 0.015), erythema (p = 0.033), pruritus (p = 0.006) and all symptoms
      (p = 0.013). No adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: These data show a high 
      efficacy of cetirizine at twice its normally recommended dose which may be
      related to the specific antiallergic effects of this newer-generation
      antihistamine.

      histamine injections as a measure of the antihistamine effect of repeated doses
      of mizolastine. Eight volunteers were enrolled in this four-arm, double-blind,
      cross-over, randomized study. Three dose levels of once-daily mizolastine (5 mg, 
      10 mg, and 15 mg) were compared with placebo during 5-day dose periods. Histamine
      tests were performed before drug intake on days 1 and 5, and then 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 
      10, 12, 14, and 24 hours after drug intake on day 5. All 3 doses of mizolastine
      were more effective than placebo in suppressing wheal and flare reactions, and
      the antihistamine activity was highest at both the 10- and 15-mg dose levels. The
      effect on the flare reaction appeared within 1 hour, reached a maximum effect 4
      hours after administration, and persisted for as long as 24 hours. The relative
      changes in wheal and flare areas were correlated with mizolastine trough plasma
      levels on day 5. Safety was satisfactory in all groups. This study confirms that 
      mizolastine is a rapid and potent antihistamine; and its long-lasting
      effectiveness indicates that a once-daily regimen is acceptable for clinical use.

PG  - 19-24
AB  - 875 adolescents of both sexes, aged between 12 and 15 years, who had presented
      with a perennial allergic rhinitis, were included in an open study that was
      conducted by pediatricians and allergologists on the efficacy of ZYRTEC
      (CETIRIZINE). There were four evaluations in the study, at Day-10, D 0, D15 and
      D30 and it was conducted according to the following plan: A first period (D-10 to
      D 0) to establish the eligibility of the subjects to be tested, and to establish 
      the clinical allergic history, before definitive inclusion at D 0. A second
      period, of therapy, of 30 days, during which the subjects took a 10 mg tablet of 
      ZYRTEC as a daily dose. Efficacy was evaluated at each visit by scores of
      intensity of major symptoms (sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, nasal 
      pruritus) and secondary symptoms (ocular score ... ) of rhinitis, as well as
      anterior rhinoscopy. The patients made an auto-evaluation of symptoms at
      different times. Analysis of the different parameters showed a real efficacy of
      ZYRTEC, for 30 days of treatment, in young patients. Furthermore, the tolerance
      of the product is excellent. This study has shown an overall improvement in the
      symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis in patients who were treated with ZYRTEC 
      in conditions similar to those of usual medical practice by pediatricians and
      allergologists.

      permeability in human skin.
PG  - 365-9
AB  - A new technique which combines skin microinjection of minute amounts of drugs
      (0.5 microliter) and measurement of capillary permeability by intravital
      fluorescence videomicroscopy and densitometry is introduced. Glass micropipettes 
      with a tip diameter of 7-9 microns are inserted by a micromanipulator into the
      stratum papillare containing the capillary loops and used for microinjection by
      microsyringe and special dispenser. Transcapillary diffusion of sodium
      fluorescein applied by intravenous bolus injection is visualised by fluorescence 
      videomicroscopy and stored on videotape. Perivascular fluorescent light intensity
      (FLI) is measured in arbitrary units (AU) by videodensitometry around the site of
      microinjection during playback of the videotapes. The method was tested by
      microinjection of 0.5 microliter histamine (1% solution) at the distal tibial
      plateau. Mean FLI values representing microvascular permeability were 2186 AU 10 
      min after microinjection of histamine, 420 AU after physiologic saline and 1228
      AU after histamine combined with oral intake of 20 mg cetirizine. Cetirizine
      significantly reduced (P < 0.01) the increased permeability induced by histamine.
      However, the mean values after injection of the H1-blocker were still
      significantly enhanced (P < 0.01) when compared to the mean values observed after
      injection of physiologic saline solution, which provoked only minor microtrauma. 
      The technique offers new scope for pharmacological testing in man.

PG  - 182-8
AB  - 60 patients aged 16 to 46 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis were selected for
      study. Daily symptom scores of seasonal allergic rhinitis and nonspecific
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine (PC20H in mg/ml) before, during the
      pollen season and after 3 weeks of treatment with loratadine, beclomethasone
      dipropionate were evaluated. The control group received oxymetazoline.
      Nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness for 11 patients (18.3%) before the
      seasons was observed. At the beginning of the season frequency of nonspecific
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness increased to 26.3% and to 36.8% after 3-week
      treatment course. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was not related to any of the way
      of treatment. The patients treated with beclomethasone dipropionate and
      oxymetazoline showed significant relief of nasal symptoms. The patients without
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness showed lower value of symptom scores.

AB  - Two experiments were performed during the pollen season to study the activity of 
      different antiallergic drugs in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
      Nasal allergen challenge (NAC) was performed to mimic an acute attack of allergic
      rhinitis and to objectively evaluate the effect of the drugs on the early-phase
      reaction during the season. The first study assessed the effect of H1 (Cetirizine
      10 mg a day) and of a combination of H1 (Cetirizine 10 mg) plus H2 (Cimetidine
      800 mg a day) antagonists on nasal symptoms, mediator release and eosinophil
      count in a group of 16 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. During the same 
      season a second study compared in a randomized way (2 parallel groups) the effect
      of Budesonide (Rhinocort Aqua) and Azelastine (Allergodil nasal spray) in a group
      of 14 patients. Results showed that both antihistamines, applied topically of
      dosed orally, reduced sneezing even when significant increases of histamine
      concentration in nasal secretions were evidenced immediately after NAC. When a
      combination of Cetirizine and Cimetidine was administered, a significant (p <
      0.01) reduction of nasal airway resistance and increase of nasal airflow after
      NAC were demonstrated as well. In addition, topical application of Budesonide
      showed a strong (p < 0.01) effect on the infiltration and activation of
      eosinophils during the season, and on tryptase release after NAC. These effects
      lasted at least for one week after therapy.

TI  - The effect of cetirizine on sulfidoleukotriene production by blood leukocytes in 
      children with allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 964-9
AB  - Twelve children with allergic rhinitis due to monosensitivity to Dermatophagoides
      pteronyssinus (Dp) took part in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover
      study to evaluate the effect of cetirizine, a second-generation, nonsedating
      H1-blocker-type antihistamine, on sulfidoleukotriene releasability by blood
      leukocytes and to determine its correlation with clinical findings and nasal
      challenge scores. Sulfidoleukotriene release by blood leukocytes was determined
      by the cellular allergen stimulation test (CAST), which measures leukotriene
      (LT)C4, LTD4, and LTE4, all in one assay. Compared to placebo, cetirizine
      significantly (P < 0.05) decreased daily symptom scores of nasal discharge, nasal
      itching, and sneezing, as well as the number of sneezings after nasal challenge
      with the antigen, without alleviating nasal obstruction (P > 0.05). It also
      suppressed both early (P < 0.05) and late skin reactions to intradermal tests.
      Although cetirizine did not influence in vitro sulfidoleukotriene production by
      blood leukocytes with buffer or anti-IgE (P > 0.05), it substantially reduced the
      release of these mediators upon challenge with Dp antigen. Furthermore, there was
      a high correlation between the number of sneezes after challenge and the amount
      of sulfidoleukotriene released in nine patients (r = 0.78; P < 0.01). It is
      concluded that the amount of sulfidoleukotrienes produced by blood leukocytes in 
      vitro may reflect the nasal hyperreactivity of the patient, and that cetirizine, 
      which is highly effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, owes part of its
      effect to inhibition of sulfidoleukotriene releasability by blood leukocytes in
      children.

TI  - Levocabastine. An update of its pharmacology, clinical efficacy and tolerability 
      in the topical treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis.
PG  - 1032-49
AB  - Levocabastine is a potent and selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist which
      has been evaluated as a topical treatment (nasal spray and/or eyedrops) for
      allergic rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis. Data available at the time of the
      previous review in Drugs, together with more recent results, have clearly
      demonstrated that levocabastine nasal spray and eyedrops are clinically
      effective, have a rapid onset of action and are well tolerated in patients with
      nasal and/or ocular allergic conditions. Previous evidence indicating that
      topical levocabastine has efficacy similar to or better than that of topical
      sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn sodium) has been confirmed in more recent studies. 
      Furthermore, results from a number of controlled clinical trials have also shown 
      that topical levocabastine is at least as effective as oral terfenadine for the
      treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Notably, topical levocabastine appears
      to be more effective than oral terfenadine in improving the severity of selected 
      symptoms. Limited data indicating efficacy equivalent to that of oral loratadine,
      oral cetirizine or azelastine nasal spray will need to be confirmed. Data from
      several studies have shown that topical levocabastine has a tolerability profile 
      similar to that of placebo, topical sodium cromoglycate or oral terfenadine. The 
      main adverse events seen in patients treated with topical levocabastine are
      ocular irritation after application of eyedrops, and headache, nasal irritation, 
      somnolence and fatigue after administration of the nasal spray. Administered
      doses of topical levocabastine, and subsequent plasma concentrations, are low,
      and the risk of systemic adverse events is therefore expected to be minimal.
      Thus, topical administration of levocabastine rapid and effective symptom relief 
      with no apparent serious adverse events in patients with allergic rhinitis and/or
      conjunctivitis. Topical levocabastine is a useful alternative to topical sodium
      cromoglycate or oral terfenadine. Additional data supporting current evidence
      that topical levocabastine can provide more effective symptom relief than oral
      terfenadine, together with clarification of the relative efficacies of these
      agents in relation to varying pollen exposure, would help to further confirm its 
      clinical potential. However, the results available to date suggest that the
      topical formulations of levocabastine are a valuable treatment option in patients
      with allergic rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis.

TI  - Comparative wheal and flare study of mizolastine vs terfenadine, cetirizine,
      loratadine and placebo in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 459-65
AB  - 1. Mizolastine, a new benzimidazole derivative with potent selective,
      non-sedative H1-histamine antagonist activity was compared with terfenadine,
      cetirizine and loratadine using the histamine-induced wheal and flare model in
      healthy volunteers. 2. Study design was a five way double-blind crossover design 
      using a single dose of mizolastine 10 mg, terfenadine 120 mg, cetirizine 10 mg,
      loratadine 10 mg and placebo. 3. Histamine tests were performed on 10 occasions
      up to +24 h after dosing using an intradermal injection of histamine 2 micrograms
      with concommittant contralateral injection of a saline control. 4. Mizolastine,
      terfenadine, cetirizine and loratadine significantly (P < 0.001 vs placebo)
      inhibited the wheal and flare formation starting 1 to 2 h after dosing up to 24 h
      after dosing. 5. Mizolastine was significantly more active than loratadine on the
      wheal (P < 0.01) and flare (P < 0.05) inhibition from 3 up to 6 and 8 h
      respectively, as active as terfenadine on both parameters and as active as
      cetirizine on wheal inhibition while less active (P < 0.01) than cetirizine on
      flare inhibition at 2 and 12 h post-dosing.

PG  - 105-9
AB  - The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      astemizole-pseudoephedrine solution compared to loratadine-pseudoephedrine syrup 
      in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Fifty children (34 boys and 16 girls) ages
      between 2 and 7 years were enrolled and randomly assigned to each group. Patients
      were evaluated before treatment and on the third and seventh days of therapy.
      Children treated with astemizole-pseudoephedrine had better results with an
      average effectiveness of 84% compared to 64% for children treated with
      loratadine-pseudoephedrine. Differences were significant for eye symptoms by
      medical evaluation and for blocked nose, sneezing and itchy nose according to the
      patients diary. Both treatment groups started action within 30 minutes after drug
      intake. 4 hours later, 38% of the patients in the astemizole-pseudoephedrine
      group and 16% in the loratadine-pseudoephedrine groups had experienced
      improvement. One patient in the former and three in the latter showed adverse
      effects.

TI  - Evaluation of a composite scoring system in conjunctival challenge with allergen:
      reproducibility and evolution during loratadine treatment.
PG  - 841-3
AB  - The reproducibility of any challenge and its sensitivity to change during
      therapeutic interventions should always be examined before any drug trial is
      conducted. Conjunctival challenge has been widely used to assess objectively the 
      efficacy of antiallergic treatments. A double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      crossover study was carried out in 26 patients allergic to grass pollen to test
      the reproducibility of a composite symptom score during placebo and control days,
      and to check the ability of loratadine to increase the provocative dose inducing 
      a positive challenge. Conjunctival challenge was carried out with increasing
      concentrations of a standardized orchard grass pollen extract until a composite
      symptom score of 5 was reached. The provocative dose inducing a positive
      challenge was similar for the baseline (6.94 +/- 8.7 index of reactivity (IR))
      and placebo days (20.0 +/- 32.5 IR) and was significantly increased (P < 0.01 and
      P < 0.001) when patients received loratadine (117.3 +/- 136.8 IR). This study
      shows that the composite score used was reproducible and sensitive to change,
      making it possible to use in drug trials.

TI  - Quantifying systemic absorption of topical hydrocortisone in erythroderma.
PG  - 403-8
AB  - The systemic absorption of topical hydrocortisone (HC) was quantified in seven
      patients with erythroderma, using the ratio of the areas under the curves for
      plasma concentration vs. time, following topical and intravenous administration. 
      Over a period of 24 h, 19-93 mg of HC was absorbed systemically, corresponding to
      4-19% of the total topical dose of 500 mg. Thus, topical HC therapy of
      erythroderma is accompanied by a pharmacologically significant systemic dose.

TI  - Pharmacologic modulation by cetirizine of some adhesion molecules expression in
      psoriatic skin lesions.
PG  - 510-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adhesion molecules play a major role in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory skin diseases by regulating lymphocyte trafficking and homing in an 
      inflamed area. METHODS: The expression of the lymphocyte function-associated
      antigen-1 (LFA-1) and of its ligand, the intercellular adhesion molecule-1
      (ICAM-1) has been studied in psoriatic skin lesions of 10 patients with guttate, 
      nummular, and palmoplantar psoriasis. In addition, the peculiar immunophenotype
      of infiltrating cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25) and their correlation with HLA-DR
      expression before and after treatment with oral cetirizine, a highly selective,
      third generation H1-receptor antagonist has been examined using the labeled
      avidin biotin (LAB) system. RESULTS: Cetirizine treatment modulated in vivo the
      expression of adhesion molecules LFA-1/CAM-1 as shown in all cases by decreased
      levels of their expression on keratinocytes and on dermal endothelial cells (P < 
      0.001). The expression of HLA-DR on keratinocytes and endothelial cells was also 
      inhibited after treatment. The numbers of infiltrating CD3-, CD4-, CD8-positive
      cells were reduced, whereas there was no significant modification of
      CD25-positive cells within the epidermis and the dermis. CONCLUSION: This open
      clinical trial suggests that cetirizine could be effective in treating psoriasis:
      (1) for its symptomatic control on itching; (2) for its immunopharmacologic
      modulation of leukocyte integrins and on the immunophenotype pattern of
      infiltrating and resident cells, and (3) for contributing to the clearing of the 
      lesions clinically.

TI  - The influence of betahistine on the dynamics of the cutaneous hypersensitivity
      reaction in patients with grass pollen allergy.
PG  - 71-8
AB  - Histamine has been well documented as an immune modulator, but the dynamics of a 
      number of histamine receptor agonists and antagonists have not been similarly
      established. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of betahistine (an
      H3-receptor blocker with partial H1- and H2-agonism) on the dynamics of the
      cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction. The skin blister technique was used to
      collect inflammatory cells after intradermal (i.d.) administration of grass
      pollen antigen, histamine and betahistine to 11 atopic volunteers. In this open, 
      cross-over study, volunteers were randomly allocated to five treatment protocols 
      i.e. (a) histamine 1 microgram i.d.; (b) betahistine 57, 114 and 285 micrograms
      i.d.; (c) i.d. grass pollen antigen; (d) (c) plus oral betahistine; (e) (c) plus 
      oral betahistine, cetirizine, (H1-blocker) and cimetidine (H2-blocker). Blister
      fluid containing cells were collected on microscope slides at 6 and 24 h after
      i.d. injections. The areas of the wheal and flare and of induration were
      measured, respectively, at 0.25, and, 1, 6 and 24 h. Combined oral therapy with
      cetirizine, cimetidine and betahistine reduced the area of grass pollen-induced
      induration significantly at all time periods, but caused a significant increase
      in eosinophil and neutrophil vacuolisation during the late phase reaction. This
      did not occur with orally administered betahistine alone. Intradermal betahistine
      induced significantly more neutrophil and eosinophil vacuolization than histamine
      and, in contrast to the latter, also mediated a concentration-dependent late
      phase induration. The results of this study suggest that the H3-receptor
      regulates a feedback system in conjunction with that previously proven for the
      H2-receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Astemizole-D causes less sleep impairment than loratadine-D.
PG  - 167-74
AB  - This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial was initiated
      to evaluate and compare the tolerability of once-daily astemizole-D capsules (10 
      mg astemizole/240 mg pseudoephedrine) and twice-daily loratadine-D tablets (5 mg 
      loratadine/120 mg pseudoephedrine), with particular reference to the impact of
      treatment on quality of sleep. A total of 240 healthy volunteers participated in 
      this study with a treatment duration of 3 days. Astemizole-D consistently
      produced less sleep impairment than loratadine-D with statistically significant
      differences in favour of astemizole-D reported for night-time waking on days 4
      and 5 (P = 0.004 and P = 0.006, respectively), as well as for night-time
      restlessness on day 4 and the total score for all sleep parameters on day 4 (P < 
      0.05). Global evaluations of overall sleep quality at the end of the trial also
      revealed some statistically significant differences in favour of astemizole-D.
      Both drugs were well tolerated and there were no differences in the incidence and
      type of adverse events reported in the two treatment groups. Slight changes in
      heart rate and blood-pressure were observed in both treatment groups, but these
      were small and were not considered to be of clinical significance. In conclusion,
      once-daily astemizole-D is well tolerated and appears to cause less sleep
      impairment than twice-daily loratadine-D.

TI  - Comparison of intranasal triamcinolone acetonide with oral loratadine for the
      treatment of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 479-92
AB  - This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study
      compared the safety and efficacy of intranasal triamcinolone acetonide with oral 
      loratadine in relieving symptoms of ragweed-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis.
      Patients from community-based allergy practices with a history of at least two
      seasons of seasonal allergic rhinitis verified by a positive skin test received
      either once-daily treatment with intranasal triacinolone acetonide 220 micrograms
      plus 1 placebo capsule or oral loratadine 10 mg plus placebo nasal spray. Other
      medications for rhinitis were prohibited. Changes in rhinitis symptoms were
      assessed by using patient evaluations, physician global evaluations, and
      withdrawal rates. Efficacy was evaluated in 274 of 298 patients randomized to
      treatment (134 to triamcinolone acetonide and 140 to loratadine). Mean total
      nasal symptom scores for weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the overall score showed
      greater improvement (P = 0.001) with triamcinolone acetonide than with
      loratadine. Improvement in all rhinitis symptoms was significantly greater with
      triamcinolone acetonide than with loratadine; there was a trend for greater
      improvement in ocular symptoms with triamcinolone acetonide. Physicians' global
      evaluations indicated triamcinolone acetonide provided moderate-to-complete
      relief in 78% of patients compared with 58% of loratadine-treated patients (P <
      or = 0.0001). Both treatments were well tolerated; headache was the most commonly
      reported adverse event in both groups. Intranasal triamcinolone acetonide was
      significantly more effective than oral loratadine in relieving the symptoms of
      seasonal allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Effects of loratadine on anti-IgE-induced inflammation, histamine release, and
      leukocyte recruitment in skin of atopics.
PG  - 414-20
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the ability of the H1-receptor antagonist
      loratadine to modify anti-IgE-induced cutaneous wheal-and-flare and late-phase
      reactions (WFR and LPR), as well as histamine release and leukocyte accumulation 
      in skin chambers. For this purpose, 10 atopics with allergic rhinitis were
      entered into a double-blind crossover study in which they received either placebo
      or loratadine (20 mg/day orally) for 8 days separated by a 7-day washout period. 
      Blisters were induced on both forearms on day 7 of each treatment period, and
      were unroofed on day 8 and covered with plastic skin chambers. Chamber fluids
      were collected during 7 h after 1-h incubation with anti-IgE or control IgG.
      Intradermal challenge with histamine and anti-IgE was performed at the same
      occasion. As compared to placebo treatment, loratadine inhibited the immediate
      WFRs to anti-IgE by 35% (wheal) and 65% (flare), respectively (P < 0.01), and
      corresponding reactions to histamine challenge by 50% and 70% (P < 0.001),
      respectively. Moreover, the initial phase (0-2 h) of the LPR induced by anti-IgE 
      was attenuated by up to approximately 60% (P < 0.001) during loratadine
      treatment. Thereafter, no inhibition of the LPR was observed. The magnitude and
      time course of histamine release into skin chambers was virtually the same after 
      loratadine and placebo treatment, with a peak during 0-1 h and a progressive
      decline during the following 2 h. Accumulation of alpha 2-macroglobulin,
      reflecting extravasation of large plasma proteins, also peaked during the first
      hour and was unaffected by loratadine during the 8-h observation period.(ABSTRACT

TI  - [Non-sedative antihistaminics in the treatment of chronic urticaria].
PG  - 137-44
AB  - Antihistamines are the drugs of choice in the symptomatic relief of chronic
      idiopathic urticaria; however, the usefulness of classic antihistamines has been 
      limited by side effects. In the 1980s a new class of antihistamines has been
      developed that maintains effectiveness and produces less side effects (eg
      anticholinergic side effects, daytime sedation, etc). This review analyzes each
      of the new nonsedating antihistamines commercially available in Spain
      (astemizole, ebastine, cetirizine, loratadine and terfenadine) and evaluates its 
      clinical efficacy and safety in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria.

TI  - Investigation of the stereoselective metabolism of the chiral H1-antihistaminic
      drug terfenadine by high-performance liquid chromatography.
PG  - 219-25
AB  - The enantiomers of the racemic H1-antihistaminic drug terfenadine (1) have been
      resolved by fractional crystallization of the diastereomeric salts with optically
      active 2-chlorotartranilic acid. The enantiomeric excess of both terfenadine
      enantiomers was determined using an achiral and a chiral HPLC system after
      formation of diastereomers with S-(+)-naphthylethylisocyanate. To investigate the
      metabolism of terfenadine after oral administration, an achiral HPLC system,
      equipped with a conventional reversed-phase column, was used to quantify the main
      metabolite MDL 16.455 (2) in human serum and urine. The determination of the
      enantiomeric composition of 2 was achieved using an Ultron ES-OVM column as
      chiral stationary phase. Metabolite 2, extracted from human blood plasma, was
      found to be enriched in the R-enantiomer, but was excreted in urine as racemate. 
      The results of a study including six volunteers are presented.

AB  - The effects of two selective H1 receptor blockers, cetirizine and loratadine, in 
      comparison with placebo, on basophil histamine release and the bronchial response
      to histamine were assessed. The studies were performed in a group of 18 patients 
      with pollinosis and 22 with atopic asthma. Both tests were performed before and
      after medication. Histamine release from isolated basophils was evaluated by
      Shore's method using anti-IgE and pollen antigen as stimulants. The bronchial
      provocation tests were performed by Ryan's method. The results were expressed as 
      PC20FEV1. It was shown that both drugs significantly inhibited basophil histamine
      release induced by anti-igE or specific allergen. It was also found that these
      drugs effectively reduced the bronchial response to histamine challenge. These
      findings confirm the beneficial clinical effect of a new generation of selective 
      H1 blockers in the treatment of IgE-mediated allergic diseases, and also the
      possible role of these drugs in the therapy of atopic asthma.

PG  - 147-9
AB  - In order to examine the efficacy of cetirizine in cholinergic urticaria, we
      studied 24 patients in a double-blind crossover design during 3-week treatment
      periods, with either 10 or 20 mg/d cetirizine or placebo. The placebo period was 
      always placed in between the two verum treatments to allow for a washout of the
      drug. Evaluation of the patients' daily symptom scores based on itching, erythema
      and whealing showed a highly significant improvement (p < 0.01). The percentage
      of days with mild or no symptoms was also increased significantly with the drug
      (p < 0.05). Except for whealing (p < 0.05), no significant differences between
      the two dosages of cetirizine could be determined. Since antihistamines have
      previously been shown to be frequently unsatisfactory in the treatment of
      cholinergic urticaria, the present data are encouraging regarding the control of 
      symptoms in this condition.

TI  - The effect of H1 receptor antagonists on peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
      adenoid cells and primary cell lines.
PG  - 98-106
AB  - This study describes the in vitro effect of three H1 receptor antagonists
      (dexchlorpheniramine, terfenadine and loratadine) on human peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC, n = 30) from allergic patients and healthy individuals. 
      The three H1 receptor antagonists significantly inhibited antigen/mitogen-induced
      PBMC proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Allergen-specific T-cell 
      responses in allergic individuals were similarly inhibited. The effect of the
      three drugs was also tested in cultures of mononuclear cells derived from adenoid
      tissue. The growth kinetics were investigated using spontaneously proliferating
      cell lines to examine whether the inhibition was caused by general toxicity.
      Three cell lines, HCT 8 (an ileocaecal adenocarcinoma) RPMI 8866 (B-cell line)
      and 166 A2 (T hybridoma) were tested. Loratadine (< 0.03 microM) and
      dexchlorpheniramine (< 0.62 microM) altered the kinetics of HCT 8 and RPMI 8866, 
      respectively. When testing RPMI 8866 and 166 A2, the growth-inhibitory effect of 
      terfenadine and loratadine could be neutralized by addition of cell culture
      filtrate from RPMI 8866 or 166 A2. These culture filtrates are rich in soluble
      low-affinity IgE receptor (sCD23) and IgE-binding factor (IgEBF), respectively.
      Our findings show that the antihistamines investigated display some
      non-convential in vitro anti-allergic properties possibly not related to their
      interaction with the H1 receptor. In addition, our results suggest: a) The H1
      receptor antagonists used differ in their pattern of cell inhibition; b) The
      inhibitory effect is completely reversible at low drug concentrations.

      seasonal rhinitis. In addition, patients recorded the extent of individual
      symptoms on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Tolerability was assessed on the basis
      of adverse events reported. Data from a total of 129 patients were included in
      the analysis of drug efficacy. Treatment groups had significant reductions in the
      investigators' total symptom score during treatment. These reductions were 47%
      and 55% for azelastine and cetirizine, respectively, at day 7 and 61% and 67% at 
      day 14. There were no differences between the two groups whether they were
      analyzed overall or separately for nasal and ocular symptoms. Patients' daily VAS
      scores showed a significantly better resolution of nasal stuffiness and
      rhinorrhea in the azelastine-treated group than in the cetirizine-treated group. 
      There were no differences for any other symptom. Adverse events were reported by 
      12 patients in the azelastine group and 20 patients in the cetirizine group.
      Drowsiness was the only frequently occurring event and this was reported by 9
      patients in the cetirizine group and 2 patients in the azelastine group (P =
      0.003).

TI  - Lack of interaction between two antihistamines, mizolastine and cetirizine, and
      ethanol in psychomotor and driving performance in healthy subjects.
PG  - 143-50
AB  - The pharmacodynamic interaction between mizolastine, a new H1 antihistamine, and 
      ethanol was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, three-way crossover,
      placebo-controlled study. Eighteen healthy young male volunteers received
      mizolastine 10 mg, or cetirizine 10 mg or placebo once daily for 7 days with a
      1-week wash-out interval. An oral dose of ethanol or ethanol placebo, given 2 h
      after dosing on days 5 or 7 of each treatment period, was administered to achieve
      a peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.7 g/l then maintained for 1 h by
      two further doses of ethanol. Driving ability and psychomotor performance were
      evaluated using actual and simulated driving tests, critical flicker fusion
      threshold (CFF), adaptive tracking and divided attention (DAT) tasks. Ethanol
      produced a significant decrement in all tasks up to 5.5 h after administration:
      an increase in steering movements of 4.6, in lateral deviation of 0.45 m, in
      braking reaction time of 80 ms, in driving test and DAT performance of + 3.2; and
      a decrease in CFF and in tracking speed of 2.6 m.s-1. Neither mizolastine nor
      cetirizine significantly impaired driving ability or arousal (CFF) compared with 
      the placebo. However, both drugs significantly impaired DAT performance 6:00 h
      post-dose (increase of + 2.1 for mizolastine and + 2.4 for cetirizine). The
      tracking speed was significantly decreased 7:50 h after mizolastine
      administration (-1.3 m.s-1) and more consistently from 1:30 to 7:50 h after
      cetirizine administration (-1.4 m.s-1). No significant adverse interaction, i.e. 
      potentiation, occurred between ethanol and either antihistamine.(ABSTRACT

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the duration of Loratadine effect on
      histamine H1 receptor in the airway. Six patients with mild or moderate asthma
      were examined. Bronchial reactivity to histamine was measured according to
      Cockcroft. The significant blockade of histamine H1 receptors in airway was
      observed from the 2nd day when 10 mg of Lo was given daily. The maximal
      protection with 10 mg doses was observed after 3-4 days. After another 5-6 days
      without Loratadine bronchial responsiveness return to the initial values. Single 
      dose of 30 mg Loratadine given better protection against histamine
      bronchoconstriction than 10 mg given for 5 days. This effect was observed as
      early as 60 minutes after administration of Loratadine.

TI  - Comparative study of terfenadine and cetirizine in hay fever: assessment of
      efficacy and central nervous system effects.
PG  - 40-6
AB  - A daily dose of either terfenadine 120 mg or cetirizine 10 mg was compared in two
      parallel groups of patients suffering from hay fever. According to a
      double-blind, double-dummy, randomized design, 28 patients were treated with one 
      of the two drugs once daily in the morning for 2 weeks during the 1990 grass
      pollen season. The severity of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing,
      nasopharyngeal itching and itchy, watery, red eyes was evaluated by the
      investigator after a 1-week run-in period and at the end of the treatment. The
      patients made a daily record of the severity of symptoms on a diary card. In
      addition, drug-related central nervous system (CNS) effects were assessed at
      baseline and at the end of the treatment by neuropsychological tests aimed at
      investigating selective and sustained attention, visuomotor abilities and
      anxiety, and by quantitative, bit-mapped EEG. Both terfenadine and cetirizine
      produced a significant improvement in symptoms at endpoint without any
      significant difference between the two drugs. Drowsiness was referred by one
      patient in each treatment group. No significant impairment of psychomotor
      performance occurred with either drug. Quantitative EEG showed a significant
      power increase in the relative (%) delta band in both groups of treated patients.
      Although the difference was not statistically significant, a tendency towards
      greater involvement of the CNS was observed with the use of cetirizine. In
      conclusion, the results of this study confirm that terfenadine and cetirizine are
      equally effective in the management of hay fever. Some differentiated untoward
      EEG changes were also observed in relation to the drugs used, without any
      variation in neuropsychological performance.

AB  - Nonsedating selective peripheral H1 receptor antagonists are an important advance
      in antihistaminic therapy in allergic patients. This is a randomised,
      double-blind parallel group study comparing the use of two such agents viz
      loratadine 10mg daily and astemizole 10mg daily for two weeks in 39 Malaysian
      allergic rhinitis patients. At these dosages, both drugs were demonstrated to be 
      efficacious (p < 0.05) for controlling nasal symptoms and safe in terms of short 
      term biochemical and haematological changes and adverse effects noted. Evaluating
      efficacy criteria utilised in this study loratadine and astemizole were
      comparable but loratadine was significantly more effective in three areas viz:
      (i) in diminishing nasal symptoms after 2 weeks of treatment (p = 0.03); (ii)
      physician's efficacy evaluation after 2 weeks' treatment (p = 0.009); (iii)
      patient's efficacy evaluation after 2 weeks' treatment (p = 0.019).

TI  - Urticaria. Recognition, causes and treatment.
PG  - 717-30
AB  - The urticarias are a complex group of disorders characterised by transient
      whealing or swelling of the skin. Understanding the many possible causes is the
      first step in assessing urticaria. Allergic and drug-induced urticaria respond to
      removal of the cause. The physical urticarias, particularly delayed pressure
      urticaria and also urticarial vasculitis, require separate consideration. For the
      majority of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, nonsedating
      antihistamines are the mainstay of treatment. There are several to choose from,
      including cetirizine, astemizole, loratadine, terfenadine and acrivastine, each
      with its own pharmacokinetics and antiallergic properties. When these fail,
      histamine H2-antagonists may help either alone or in combination with
      H1-antagonists. Older sedative antihistamines are still useful. Ketotifen,
      oxatomide and azelastine have mast cell stabilising effects that are considered
      an advantage in treating these disorders. Second-line therapies include a wide
      range of drugs such as doxepin, dapsone, attenuated androgens, calcium
      antagonists, antimalarials, gold and methotrexate. The most effective and
      regularly used second-line agents are corticosteroids. These are best limited to 
      short term crisis management, except in severe recalcitrant cases, and in
      patients with pressure urticaria or urticarial vasculitis. Recent work on
      circulating histamine releasing autoantibodies suggests that there is scope for
      more aggressive immunosuppression in selected patients. However, effective
      treatment with immunosuppression often requires plasma exchange and more toxic
      agents such as cyclosporin. Such treatments are only likely to be entertained in 
      exceptional cases.

TI  - Loratadine. A reappraisal of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use
      in allergic disorders.
PG  - 617-37
AB  - Loratadine is a long-acting antihistamine agent, exhibiting partial selectivity
      for peripheral histamine H1-receptors. To date, loratadine has been evaluated in 
      allergic rhinitis, urticaria and, to a limited extent, in asthma. In several
      large controlled comparative clinical studies, loratadine was superior to
      placebo, faster acting than astemizole and as effective as azatadine, cetirizine,
      chlorpheniramine (chlorphenamine), clemastine, hydroxyzine, mequitazine and
      terfenadine in patients with allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. The
      clinical effectiveness of loratadine in asthma is at present unclear. Loratadine 
      is well tolerated. At dosages of 10 mg daily, commonly reported adverse events
      were somnolence, fatigue and headache. Sedation occurred less frequently with
      loratadine than with azatadine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine and
      mequitazine. Serious ventricular arrhythmias, as reported with some other second 
      generation histamine H1-receptor antagonists, have not been observed with
      loratadine to date. Thus, loratadine, with its attributes of once daily
      administration, fast onset of action and essentially nonsedating properties,
      would appear to be an appropriate first-line agent for the treatment of allergic 
      rhinitis or urticaria.

      allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 235-9
AB  - The efficacy of loratadine as prophylactic therapy for seasonal allergic rhinitis
      was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled
      study. One hundred eighteen subjects received either loratadine, 10 mg once
      daily, or placebo for 6 weeks. Treatment was begun prior to the onset of grass
      pollen seasonal symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Total symptom-free days occurred
      more frequently in subjects receiving loratadine. More loratadine than placebo
      subjects (65% versus 49%) had no symptoms or mild rhinitis at the end of the
      study. In contrast, the differences between loratadine and placebo in symptom
      scores did not achieve significance. The incidence of sedation and
      anticholinergic effects were comparable between the groups. Prophylactic
      loratadine therapy was effective in suppressing symptoms of seasonal allergic
      rhinitis and providing patients with symptom-free days throughout the pollen
      season.

AB  - A total of 360 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized in a
      placebo-controlled, dose-finding study comparing three concentrations (0.06%,
      0.125%, and 0.25%) of a cetirizine nasal spray, administered three times a day
      for 2 weeks. The primary criterion of efficacy was the percentage of days with no
      or only mild symptoms of rhinitis (PDMax1), as evaluated by the patients. The
      median PDMax1 were 16.7%, 30.8%, 42.9%, and 26.7% for the placebo, 0.06%, 0.125%,
      and 0.25% groups, respectively. Although the global comparison among the four
      groups only approached statistical significance (P = 0.076), the difference
      (26.2%) between the placebo and 0.125% groups was clinically and statistically
      significant (P = 0.011). For the global evaluation by the investigator, the best 
      results were seen in the 0.125% group (P = 0.03). The occurrence of adverse
      events did not differ among the four treatment groups and consisted mainly of
      nasal events, occurring in 22.5%, 17.1%, 12.9%, and 24.4% of the patients for the
      placebo, 0.06%, 0.125%, and 0.25% groups, respectively (P = 0.184). These results
      indicate that the 0.125% concentration is significantly better than placebo and
      offers the best therapeutic ratio.

TI  - Topical levocabastine compared with oral loratadine for the treatment of seasonal
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Swedish GP Allergy Team.
PG  - 611-5
AB  - This multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial was initiated 
      to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two antihistamines, topical
      levocabastine (eye-drops and nasal spray) and oral loratadine, for the treatment 
      of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the primary care setting. A total of 
      95 adult patients participated in the study with a treatment duration of 5 weeks.
      Forty-seven patients were randomized to receive twice daily levocabastine
      eye-drops and nasal spray plus an oral placebo, and 48 to receive once daily oral
      loratadine with placebo eye-drops and nasal spray. Naphazoline eye-drops and
      xylometazoline nasal spray were permitted as rescue medication. No statistically 
      significant intergroup differences in therapeutic efficacy were observed. Symptom
      severity was comparable in the two treatment groups throughout the trial period. 
      At the end of the study, 86% of levocabastine-treated patients considered global 
      therapeutic efficacy to be excellent or good, as compared with 77% of those who
      received loratadine. This difference was not statistically significant. There
      were no significant differences in the use of rescue medication or in the
      incidence or severity of adverse events in the two treatment groups. In
      conclusion, levocabastine eye-drops and nasal spray appear to be as effective and
      well tolerated as oral loratadine for the treatment of seasonal allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis.

TI  - Assessment of the efficacy and safety of three dose levels of cetirizine given
      once daily in children with perennial allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 598-604
AB  - The present study compared the efficacy and safety of three dose levels of
      cetirizine (2.5, 5, and 10 mg) once a day with placebo over 14 days in
      6-12-year-old children with perennial allergic rhinitis. The design was a
      double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study. Five symptoms
      (sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, nasal pruritus, and ocular
      pruritus) were rated according to severity by investigators at the visits and
      daily by patients. Eighty-three patients were randomized to placebo, 84 to 2.5 mg
      cetirizine, 85 to 5 mg cetirizine, and 76 to 10 mg cetirizine. Groups were
      comparable at inclusion. The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of days
      with no or only mild symptoms: at all doses, cetirizine appeared to be more
      effective than placebo, but a significant difference was reached only in the
      10-mg group (difference in medians of 22%; P = 0.016). The test of linearity was 
      significant (P = 0.026) for the percentage of asymptomatic days. The
      investigators' assessments at each visit scored the symptoms in the placebo group
      higher, i.e., more severe, than in the active groups, the 10-mg dose causing the 
      greatest reduction in symptoms. Adverse events were infrequent and generally mild
      or moderate in severity. It was concluded that cetirizine at a 10-mg, once daily 
      dose could be used to treat effectively 6-12-year-old children with perennial
      allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Double-blind study of cetirizine in atopic eczema in children.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - An 8-week, double-blind study of the clinical efficacy of cetirizine was
      performed in a group of 6 to 12-year-old children suffering from atopic eczema.
      Patients were enrolled in the study if they presented the diagnostic criteria of 
      atopic dermatitis established by Hanifin and Rajka. Pruritus in the
      cetirizine-treated group diminished significantly more rapidly than in the
      control group receiving only placebo. During the 8 weeks of the study, diary card
      scores showed a statistically significant decrease in erythema and other
      cutaneous symptoms, such as lichenification, in the cetirizine group. The
      children's parents did not observe any side effects (somnolence or decreased
      attention) during the study. The results of this preliminary study suggest that
      cetirizine can effectively control pruritus and other cutaneous symptoms in
      children suffering from atopic eczema without noticeable side effects.

TI  - Lectin-induced increase in microvascular permeability to colloidal carbon in
      vitro may involve protein kinase C activation.
PG  - 136-9
AB  - Two plant lectins, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and concanavalin A (Con A), which 
      are known to bind to endothelial cells (ECs), were found to increase the leakage 
      of colloidal carbon (CC) into the walls of microvessels in the villi of rat small
      intestine, when added to a gelatin-containing perfusate (GPSS) at a concentration
      of 10 micrograms/ml. Pretreatment of the microvessels with the protein kinase C
      (PKC) inhibitor Ro 31-8220 (1 x 10(-6) M) significantly reduced this effect. In
      contrast, the leakage of CC in response to A23187 (1 x 10(-4) M) was not affected
      by Ro 31-8220. Peanut agglutinin (PNA) and succinyl concanavalin A (SuccCon A),
      which do not bind to ECs, had no effect at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml. A
      lower concentration of WGA (1 microgram/ml) had no significant effect of its own,
      but significantly reduced the leakage of CC in response to both
      platelet-activating factor (PAF, 5 x 10(-6) M) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 1 x
      10(-4) M), but not to beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB, 1 x 10(-6) M). These
      results suggest that all these effects of WGA and Con A involve cell surface
      receptors, albeit in a non-specific way. A possible mode of action is discussed.

TI  - H1-receptor antagonists. Comparative tolerability and safety.
PG  - 350-80
AB  - First-generation histamine H1-receptor antagonists, such as diphenhydramine,
      triprolidine, hydroxyzine or chlorpheniramine (chlorphenamine), frequently cause 
      somnolence or other CNS adverse effects. Second-generation H1-antagonists, such
      as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine and cetirizine, represent a true advance
      in therapeutics. In manufacturers' recommended doses, they have a more favourable
      benefit/risk ratio than their predecessors with regard to lack of CNS effects,
      and do not exacerbate the adverse CNS effects of alcohol or other CNS-active
      chemicals. Rarely, some of the newer H1-antagonists may cause cardiac
      dysrhythmias after overdose or under other specific conditions. The concept of a 
      risk-free H1-antagonist is proving to be an oversimplification. An H1-antagonist 
      absolutely free from adverse effects under all circumstances is not yet available
      for use. The magnitude of the beneficial effects of each H1-antagonist should be 
      related to the magnitude of the unwanted effects, especially in the CNS and
      cardiovascular system, and a benefit-risk ratio or therapeutic index should be
      developed for each medication in this class.

AB  - This study aimed at evaluating loratadine efficiency versus placebo in the
      treatment of patients with chronic urticaria. The single blind trial involved 31 
      patients divided into the group treated with active drug (21 patients), and
      placebo (10 patients). Loratadine in a daily dose of 10 mg (1 tablet in the
      evening) was administered for 28 days whereas placebo was given for 14 days.
      Patients filled so-called self-observation charts in which a severity of disease 
      symptoms and/or adverse reactions were noted every day. Skin test with histamine 
      was performed in the hospital before the trial, after 2 weeks, and in the last
      day of the treatment. The obtained results showed a marked decrease in erythema, 
      wheals, and prurigo in patients treated with loratadine. No such an improvement
      was seen in placebo group. Skin reaction to histamine was also markedly reduced
      in loratadine group. Loratadine proved an efficient agent in the treatment of the
      chronic urticaria in 71% of patients.

PG  - 121-3
AB  - We report a 41-year-old Caucasian woman with polycystic liver and kidney disease,
      and a 9-year history of severe cyclical urticaria related to her menses. The
      urticaria was not adequately controlled by antihistamines or Prempak-C
      (conjugated oestrogens and norgestrel). Intradermal testing with progesterone was
      strongly positive at 30 min and 18 h. Buserelin, administered intranasally at
      doses of up to 800 micrograms daily, controlled the urticaria within 4 weeks, and
      she was completely symptom-free thereafter. She had therapy-induced amenorrhoea
      and occasional hot flushes. Unfortunately, her liver cysts progressively
      enlarged, and a right hepatectomy was performed in June 1992, but she died after 
      complications 3 weeks later. Prior to this she had been free of urticaria for 6
      months after starting buserelin. Buserelin, a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone
      analogue, may be useful in the management of progesterone-induced urticaria, in
      patients in whom conjugated oestrogens are contraindicated or unhelpful.

TI  - Tolerability of nimesulide in aspirin-sensitive patients.
PG  - 29-32
AB  - In most patients with aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)
      intolerance, antiinflammatory treatment is a clinical problem. In this study we
      evaluated the tolerance to a new nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, nimesulide
      (Aulin, Boehringer Mannheim, Italia), in 429 patients presenting with clear
      histories of intolerance to NSAIDs. Nimesulide has been chosen due to its weak
      inhibitory action on cyclooxygenase and its peculiar mechanism of action. We
      carried out a single-blind challenge with cumulative doses of nimesulide
      administered on three different days, until the therapeutic dose of 200 mg or
      intolerance symptoms were reached. Nimesulide has been well tolerated in 418
      subjects and only 11 patients (3.3%) showed a positive test. Our study
      demonstrates that nimesulide seems to be a suitable drug in aspirin
      hypersensitivity.

TI  - Therapeutic effect of loratadine on pruritus in patients with atopic dermatitis. 
      A multi-crossover-designed study.
PG  - 22-6
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of loratadine on
      pruritus in patients with atopic dermatitis, considering the patients' sensation 
      of itch. Sixteen patients, mean age 24.8 years, with moderate or severe atopic
      dermatitis were included in a double-blind and placebo-controlled study with a
      six-period, multi-crossover design. The patients were given 10 mg loratadine or
      placebo every day, alternating between loratadine and placebo every 2 weeks. The 
      degree of pruritus during the day and during the night was recorded by the
      patients every morning and every evening, respectively, on a 10-cm visual analog 
      scale. The study detected a significant effect of loratadine, as compared with
      placebo, on pruritus during the day, pruritus during the night, and severity of
      rash. At least nine of the 16 patients included were classified as responders and
      only one as a nonresponder to loratadine treatment. It is concluded that
      loratadine may be tried as an adjuvant therapy in the management of severe and
      moderate atopic dermatitis, in patients complaining of pruritus.

TI  - A comparison of azelastine nasal spray and cetirizine tablets in the treatment of
      allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 17-23
AB  - A total of 40 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with either 
      azelastine nasal spray 0.14 mg/nostril twice daily (0.56 mg/day) or cetirizine
      tablets 10 mg once daily. Treatment was for a period of eight weeks. The rhinitis
      symptoms were evaluated according to a four-point scale (0 = absent, 3 = severe).
      The Total Rhinitis Symptom Score (TRSS) was derived from the sum of the
      individual symptom scores. Symptoms were assessed at baseline prior to treatment 
      and at weeks 2, 4 and 8. Compared baseline, TRSS for both the azelastine and
      cetirizine groups were less at each assessment during treatment, a slight
      non-significant advantage was seen in the azelastine group. At the end of the
      study, physicians rated global efficacy as being "good" or "excellent" in 73.7%
      of azelastine patients and 55.5% of cetirizine patients. Both treatments were
      well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported, however, two
      cetirizine patients withdrew from the study because of somnolence. In conclusion,
      azelastine has been shown to be at least as effective as cetirizine in the relief
      of the symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Acoustic rhinometry compared with posterior rhinomanometry in the measurement of 
      histamine- and bradykinin-induced changes in nasal airway patency.
PG  - 33-7
AB  - 1. Acoustic rhinometry is a relatively new method for objectively assessing nasal
      airway patency. In this paper we compare acoustic rhinometry with active
      posterior rhinomanometry. 2. Twenty normal healthy volunteers underwent nasal
      challenge with either histamine or bradykinin, 100 micrograms to 1000 micrograms,
      and responses were assessed by acoustic rhinometry. A further 20 subjects
      received identical nasal challenges and responses were assessed by active
      posterior rhinomanometry. 3. On a subsequent occasion, the subjects challenged
      previously with histamine, were given the selective H1-receptor antagonist,
      cetirizine, 10 mg orally, 3 h before repeat nasal challenge with histamine,
      100-1000 micrograms. Again, responses were assessed by active posterior
      rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry. 4. The acoustic reflection measurements
      and the nasal airway resistance measurements showed comparable, significant
      dose-related changes in nasal patency to both histamine and bradykinin.
      Pretreatment with cetirizine blocked the histamine-induced change in nasal
      patency as measured by both methods. 5. We conclude that acoustic rhinometry has 
      a number of advantages over posterior rhinomanometry. It is quick to perform,
      requires minimal subject co-operation and gives a reliable objective, measurement
      of dose-related changes in nasal airway patency before and after pharmacological 
      treatment.

TI  - Evaluation of the efficacy of H1 blockers by noninvasive measurement techniques.
PG  - 146-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation techniques for determining the strength of action and the 
      onset of activity of H1 receptor blockers have not yet been sufficiently
      standardized. OBJECTIVE: The clinical efficacy of the H1 receptor blocker
      loratadine was to be measured upon a wheal response subsequent to an
      intracutaneous injection of 0.1 ml histamine (0.1%). METHODS: In a pilot study,
      10 patients were treated with the H1 receptor blocker loratadine for a period of 
      7 days. Various noninvasive measurement techniques, i.e. 20-MHz sonography,
      laser-Doppler flowmetry, chromatometry using the Lab* system and
      computer-assisted planimetry, were applied to provide a quantitative evaluation
      of the wheal and the marginal erythema. Using these quantification methods, the
      development of the urticarial reaction 20 min after injection and its decline
      were evaluated. RESULTS: The urticarial reaction was reduced substantially under 
      treatment with 10 mg loratadine over a period of 7 days. The methods we used
      could accurately quantify different aspects of the urticarial reaction
      noninvasively. CONCLUSIONS: All of the chosen measurement techniques are widely
      recognized. For objective assessment of the urticarial reaction with
      high-frequency ultrasound, we recommend the measurement of the distance between
      skin entrance echo and fascia since the demarcation of the wheal is often
      impossible by ultrasound. In order to improve comparison of results of various
      workgroups in the future, we therefore suggest the use of the selected
      combination of noninvasive procedures as a standard for evaluating the efficacy
      of H1 receptor blockers.

TI  - Comparative study of SCH 434 and CTM-D in the treatment of seasonal allergic
      rhinitis.
PG  - 50-6
AB  - The efficacy and safety of an extended-release combination of loratadine plus
      pseudoephedrine sulfate (SCH 434) was compared with that of a tablet containing
      chlorpheniramine maleate plus pseudoephedrine sulfate (CTM-D) in 131 patients
      with symptomatic seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients were randomly assigned to
      receive either SCH 434 (loratadine 5 mg and pseudoephedrine sulfate 120 mg) or
      CTM-D (chlorpheniramine maleate 12 mg and pseudoephedrine sulfate 120 mg) twice
      daily for 2 weeks. Evaluations were made after 3, 7, and 14 days of treatment.
      Demographics (age, race, sex, and duration of seasonal allergic rhinitis) and
      baseline total symptom scores were comparable between groups. Both combination
      products were effective in relieving the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
      Improvement in total symptom scores was 54% on day 3 and 65% on day 14 in the SCH
      434 group versus 57% on day 3 and 64% on day 14 in the CTM-D group. Individual
      symptom scores (nasal discharge, stuffiness, nasal itching, sneezing, and ocular 
      symptoms) responded similarly. A smaller proportion of patients in the SCH 434
      group reported side effects, especially dry mouth (7% vs 19%, P = 0.07), fatigue 
      (6% vs 25%, P < 0.01), and sedation (7% vs 22%, P < 0.03). In conclusion, the
      combination of loratadine plus pseudoephedrine sulfate was equally as effective
      as a classic antihistamine (chlorpheniramine maleate) plus pseudoephedrine
      sulfate but had a lower incidence of side effects.

      modify skin blood flow induced by a histamine prick test. The vasomotor response 
      was compared using a laser Doppler flowmeter. Two hours after intake of the
      antihistaminic drug, there were significant differences between both drugs: at 4 
      h, the antihistaminic effect of cetirizine persists, whereas ebastine only showed
      moderate activity. The reduction of the cutaneous blood flow values (CBFV) showed
      good activity in both groups, but cetirizine was more potent and showed faster
      activity than ebastine.

PG  - 583-8
AB  - The effect of the therapy with Loratadine on skin and bronchial reactivity to
      histamine and on a specific histamine release from isolated basophils of allergic
      patients was assessed. The studies were carried out on a 34 patients (23 with
      pollen rhinitis and 11 with a mild bronchial asthma). The effect loratadine
      versus placebo on the skin reactivity to histamine was measured in patients
      suffering from pollen rhinitis. Outside the pollen season in 12 patients from the
      above group a histamine release from isolated basophils was evaluated by Shore
      method, using a-IgE and pollen allergen as liberators, before and after 4 days
      therapy with loratadine. In the group of the 11 asthmatic patients the effect of 
      the single dose of 10 mg Loratadine on spirometric parameters and on a bronchial 
      response to histamine was studied. The Bronchial Provocation Test with histamine 
      was performed by the Ryan's method. The results were expressed as PC20 FEV1. It
      was shown that loratadine statistically significant limited of the skin
      reactivity to histamine and specific histamine release from basophils. The one
      tablet of Loratadine have not changed of spirometric parameters in the patients
      with mild asthma, but statistically significant reduced their bronchial response 
      to histamine.

TI  - H1-receptor antagonists: does a dose-response relationship exist?
PG  - 592-7
AB  - Objective dose-response studies of histamine receptor blockade in the skin have
      been performed using suppression of the histamine-induced wheal and flare.
      Results with second-generation H1-antagonists indicate a dose-dependent increase 
      in histamine skin test suppression. Few dose-response studies of H1-antagonists
      in allergic rhinitis or chronic urticaria have been published. The manufacturers'
      recommend doses for H1-antagonists appear to be optimal with regard to safety and
      should not be exceeded, as the incidence of adverse effects may increase when
      higher doses are used. Also, even if higher doses are given, complete symptom
      relief may not occur in all patients, as total H1-blockade still leaves the
      effects of other chemical mediators of inflammation unopposed.

TI  - Nonsedating H1 antihistamines in chronic urticaria.
PG  - 585-91
AB  - Histamine type 1 (H1) receptor antagonists are the principal therapy for chronic 
      urticaria. Their usefulness, however, is sometimes compromised by undesirable
      central nervous system (CNS) side effects such as daytime sedation and
      anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth. Second-generation, nonsedating
      antihistamines (terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and cetirizine
      hydrochloride) are just as effective as the potent first-generation
      antihistamines such as hydroxyzine. Yet they do not cause the CNS and
      anticholinergic side effects seen with the older agents. Cardiovascular side
      effects, which have been recently reported with terfenadine and astemizole, are
      dose related and rare, generally occurring in patients who overdose or who take
      concomitant medications that increase serum antihistamine levels. The
      second-generation antihistamines also offer twice daily and once daily dosage
      schedules, which are more convenient than the two- to four-times daily schedules 
      of the older agents. They should therefore be considered first-line agents for
      the treatment of chronic urticaria. This article is a review of the role of the
      nonsedating antihistamines in the treatment of chronic urticaria.

TI  - Comparative study of the efficacy and safety of loratadine syrup and terfenadine 
      suspension in the treatment of chronic allergic skin diseases in a pediatric
      population.
PG  - 1196-9
AB  - The safety and efficacy of loratadine (Sch 29851, CAS 79794-75-5) syrup (5 or 10 
      mg QD) was compared to terfenadine (CAS 50679-08-8) suspension (30 mg b.i.d.) in 
      a randomized, third party blind, parallel-group, multicenter trial. Two hundred
      thirty-six children ages 6-12 years, with chronic allergic skin disorders were
      treated for 14 days. The predominant skin condition was atrophic dermatitis (88% 
      of the efficacy population). Evaluation of efficacy was based on investigator and
      patient assessment of symptoms, overall condition of the disease, and therapeutic
      response to treatment. After 7 and 14 days of treatment, and in the endpoint
      analysis (last valid study visit for all patients) the decreases from baseline in
      mean total sign/symptom scores, and all individual symptoms, did not differ
      significantly (p > 0.05) between treatments. Itching improved 54% in the
      loratadine group and 58% in the terfenadine group in the endpoint analysis.
      Forty-five percent of patients treated with loratadine and 46% of
      terfenadine-treated patients treated had complete or marked relief of their
      symptoms at endpoint. The efficacy of loratadine increased during the study,
      suggesting that patients did not develop tolerance to the medication over the
      14-day course of therapy. Mild to moderate treatment-related adverse experiences 
      were reported in 7/113 patients (6%) treated with loratadine and 11/119 patients 
      (9%) treated with terfenadine. Single daily doses of 5 mg or 10 mg loratadine
      syrup were comparable to terfenadine suspension 30 mg twice daily for improving
      the symptoms of chronic allergic skin disorders in children. Loratadine was safe 
      and well tolerated.

TI  - The effect of cetirizine on symptoms and wealing in dermographic urticaria.
PG  - 580-3
AB  - The effect of cetirizine, 10 mg at night, on dermographic urticaria, was studied 
      in 19 patients. The study design was a randomized, double-blind, crossover
      comparison with placebo, each treatment being given for 7 days. Patients kept a
      daily diary of itch and weal severity (100-mm linear analogue scale), and
      recorded sleep disturbance. The dermographic weal response was measured
      objectively with a spring-loaded stylus, and the weal threshold calculated from
      the force/response curve. There was a small, insignificant subjective response to
      placebo, but no objective response. On cetirizine, the subjective assessment of
      wealing was reduced from 34.3 +/- 6.7 (mean +/- SEM, 0-100 scale) to 16.8 +/- 4.1
      (P = 0.02), itch was reduced from 43.2 +/- 6.6 to 19.4 +/- 4.1 (P = 0.001), and
      nights disturbed from 46.2 to 8.8% (P = 0.03). There was a shift to the right in 
      the position of the force/response curve, and the wealing threshold increased
      from 24.6 +/- 3.2 to 54.7 +/- 4.4 g/mm2 (P = 0.00001), but there was no
      correlation between change in itch scores and wealing threshold. Cetirizine 10 mg
      daily is an effective treatment in dermographic urticaria, and its usefulness
      will depend on the prevalence of unwanted effects.

TI  - In dermographic urticaria H2 receptor antagonists have a small but
      therapeutically irrelevant additional effect compared with H1 antagonists alone.
PG  - 575-9
AB  - Two studies of the additional effect of an H2 receptor antagonist when given in
      combination with an H1 antagonist were undertaken in dermographic urticaria.
      Using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design in 19 patients, a combination 
      of cetirizine (10 mg at night) and ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) was compared
      with a combination of cetirizine (10 mg at night) and placebo. The addition of
      ranitidine did not produce any significant difference in linear analogue scores
      for weal, itch or sleep disturbance. There was a significant depression of the
      frictional force/wealing response curve with an increase in wealing threshold (P 
      < 0.0001) following the addition of H2 blockade. The wealing threshold was 54.7
      +/- 4.4 (mean +/- SEM) g/mm2 for the H1 antagonist alone, and 73.2 +/- 5.7 for
      the combination of H1 and H2 antagonists. In a second similar study involving
      nine different patients, comparing terfenadine (120 mg twice daily) with a
      combination of terfenadine and ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), the weal
      threshold was 59.8 +/- 6.6 for the H1 antagonist alone, and 73.0 +/- 6.4 for the 
      combination of H1 and H2 antagonists. Thus, in dermographic urticaria, adding an 
      H2 antagonist to treatment with a potent H1 antagonist gives a small, significant
      reduction in wealing response, but no symptomatic benefit. We conclude that
      involvement of the H2 receptor in this urticarial disease is minimal, and does
      not justify the use of H2 receptor antagonists.

      third-party-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. A total of 96 children were 
      included in the efficacy analysis: 49 children received 5 or 10 mg of loratadine 
      once daily, and 47 received 15 mg of terfenadine twice daily, for 14 days. The
      mean total score for both nasal and non-nasal symptoms was decreased
      significantly from baseline at days 3, 7, and 14 in both treatment groups. At
      endpoint, these scores had improved 73% in each group. There were no
      statistically significant differences between the two groups in the total symptom
      scores at any point during the study. Both treatments were effective in relieving
      individual nasal and nonnasal symptoms. Therapeutic response to treatment was
      good or excellent in 82% of loratadine-treated children and in 60% of
      terfenadine-treated children. Few adverse events were reported during the study; 
      all were mild or moderate and were not significantly different between the two
      treatment groups. There were no reports of sedation or dry mouth in either group.
      Once-daily treatment with 5 or 10 mg of loratadine was as effective as
      twice-daily treatment with 15 mg of terfenadine in improving the symptoms of
      seasonal allergic rhinitis in children 3 to 6 years old. Both treatments were
      well tolerated.

      treatment of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis].
PG  - 179-84
AB  - Our patients with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis usually present severe
      clinical symptoms. A single daily dose of cetirizine 10 mg might be insufficient 
      for these patients. To investigate this hypothesis we compared clinical efficacy 
      and adverse side effects between two daily doses of cetirizine, 10 and 20 mg. We 
      designed a comparative open randomized study, including 38 patients, with hay
      fever sensitized to local pollens (grass, olive, parietaria judaica, chenopodium 
      album, artemisia vulgaris and plantago lanceolata) diagnosed by clinical history 
      and a positive skin prick test (wheal > 3 mm), 20 women and 18 men, aged 17 to 57
      years (x: 31.32 +/- 9.73), living in the same geographic area. Randomly, after a 
      week run in period, 21 subjects received a daily dose of cetirizine 10 mg during 
      2 weeks, and the other 17 received 10 mg twice a day. The symptomatic score used 
      was based on: sneezes number, nasal itching, nasal secretion, nasal congestion,
      ocular itching, lacrimation, weight gain, sedation and additional
      methylprednisolone usage. All symptoms were scored on a 0-3 scale (0: absent; 1: 
      mild; 2: moderate; 3: severe). A mean 8 points daily score during the previous
      week was required for recruitment. Nasal eosinophilia was determined at baseline 
      and at the end of treatment. The study was conducted in may 1992. We did not find
      significant differences between the two groups, except in sneezes number and
      sedation. Both groups improved their symptoms, in comparison with the basal week 
      (p < 0.01) and reduced their oral steroid use (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

      rhinitis. Patients were treated with either loratadine (10 mg) or placebo for 1
      month. At the end of treatment, a significant decrease in the symptom scores was 
      noted in both groups of patients. However, the clinical score was significantly
      lower in the loratadine group compared to the placebo group. At the end of
      treatment, the numbers of IL-2R+, HLA-DR+ and PCNA+ cells were significantly
      decreased only in the group on loratadine. An almost significant correlation was 
      also observed between the numbers of IL-2R+ cells and symptoms in the loratadine 
      group. Our results show that loratadine exerts its beneficial effect possibly by 
      inhibiting both the action of histamine and immune activation.

PG  - 258-62
AB  - The efficacy of the new nonsedating antihistamines loratadine and cetirizine was 
      compared in a randomized, single-blind, crossover, controlled study with that of 
      the classical antihistamines cyproheptadine and ketotifen in seven patients with 
      primary acquired cold urticaria (ACU). The patients received each of the four
      drugs for 14 consecutive days with a 7-day interval between drugs. We evaluated
      clinical symptomatology, adverse effects, minimum time of cold contact
      stimulation required to induce an immediate coalescent wheal (CSTT), and
      inhibition of histamine-induced wheal response. Both loratadine and cetirizine
      showed suppression of symptoms with infrequent adverse effects. Important
      side-effects were observed in patients receiving cyproheptadine. Improvement in
      CSTT was statistically significant for all drugs compared with baseline values,
      without differences among them. The histamine-induced skin test was significantly
      inhibited by all antihistamines. Wheal reductions were 34.6% for loratadine and
      50.9% for cetirizine. This study suggests that both loratadine and cetirizine may
      be effective in the treatment of primary ACU.

TI  - Multicenter double-blind comparative study of terfenadine and cetirizine in hay
      fever.
PG  - 162-6
AB  - The efficacy and safety of terfenadine in the management of hay fever were
      compared with those of cetirizine in a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group 
      study, carried out during the 1990 spring pollen season. The patients were
      randomly assigned to one of two groups of treatment, 70 patients being given
      terfenadine 120 mg, and 72 patients cetirizine 10 mg, once daily for 7 days. The 
      severity of the main symptoms was evaluated at baseline and after treatment by a 
      4-point rating scale. In addition, the overall symptom severity was recorded
      daily by the patient on a diary card. Both terfenadine and cetirizine produced
      significant relief of symptoms by the end of treatment, with a decrease in
      symptom severity ranging from 46 to 69% for terfenadine and from 40 to 55% for
      cetirizine. Adverse effects experienced by terfenadine- and cetirizine-treated
      patients were mainly drowsiness, with minor differences between the two groups.
      The results of this study confirmed previous experiences, showing that both
      terfenadine and cetirizine once daily should be regarded as effective drugs for
      the management of hay fever.

TI  - Comparative effects of terfenadine and loratadine in the treatment of hay fever.
PG  - 368-72
AB  - This double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study was undertaken in 40
      patients with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis during the 1990 hay fever
      season. The patients were randomized and treated for seven days with either 120
      mg terfenadine or 10 mg loratadine, each drug taken once daily in the morning.
      The severity of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasopharyngeal itching,
      and itchy, watery, red eyes was evaluated before and at the end of treatment. The
      global severity of symptoms was ranked daily by the patient on a diary card. Both
      treatment groups experienced a significant improvement of symptoms after
      treatment (p < 0.01), without any significant difference between the two study
      drugs. Terfenadine and loratadine significantly improved symptom severity by 69
      and 55% compared with the baseline values, respectively. Headache and fatigue
      were reported in three loratadine-treated patients, and sedation in one patient. 
      No side effects were observed in patients receiving terfenadine. This study
      confirmed that terfenadine 120 mg once daily is a safe and effective treatment
      for hay fever.
