TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of a novel estradiol vaginal ring for relief of
      menopausal symptoms.
PG  - 823-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy, tolerability, and acceptance of a vaginal ring
      delivering the equivalent of 50 or 100 microg per day of estradiol (E2), compared
      with placebo, for relief of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and urogenital 
      symptoms in postmenopausal women. METHODS Women with moderate to severe
      vasomotor symptoms (seven or more per day or 56 per week average) received 13
      weeks of treatment with a vaginal ring delivering 50 microg per day E2 (n = 113) 
      or 100 microg per day E2 (n = 112), or a placebo vaginal ring (n = 108). Severity
      of vasomotor symptoms was assessed by a daily diary card and the Greene
      Climacteric Scale. Urogenital signs and symptoms were evaluated via patient and
      physician assessment and vaginal cytology. Participant satisfaction with the
      vaginal ring was evaluated via questionnaire. RESULTS Vasomotor symptoms
      significantly improved in both treatment groups, compared with placebo (P .05). 
      There was a trend toward greater improvement in patient assessment of urogenital 
      signs with active rings compared with placebo. For women with vaginal atrophy at 
      baseline (n = 60), the maturation index improved significantly in both treatment 
      groups compared with placebo. Total Greene Climacteric Scale scores significantly
      improved for both E2 vaginal ring groups (P .05) compared with placebo. The
      vaginal rings were well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild or moderate and 
      consistent with estrogen therapy. CONCLUSION A novel vaginal ring delivering the
      equivalent of 50 or 100 microg per day of E2 significantly reduced the number and
      severity of vasomotor symptoms and improved urogenital symptoms, compared with
      placebo. The E2 vaginal ring was well tolerated.

TI  - Effects of estrogen plus progestin on risk of fracture and bone mineral density 
      the Women's Health Initiative randomized trial.
PG  - 1729-38
AB  - CONTEXT In the Women's Health Initiative trial of estrogen-plus-progestin
      therapy, women assigned to active treatment had fewer fractures. OBJECTIVE To
      test the hypothesis that the relative risk reduction of estrogen plus progestin
      on fractures differs according to risk factors for fractures. DESIGN, SETTING,
      AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized controlled trial (September 1993-July 2002) in which
      16 608 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years with an intact uterus at baseline
      were recruited at 40 US clinical centers and followed up for an average of 5.6
      years. INTERVENTION Women were randomly assigned to receive conjugated equine
      estrogen, 0.625 mgd, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mgd, in 1 tablet (n 
      = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All confirmed osteoporotic 
      fracture events that occurred from enrollment to discontinuation of the trial
      (July 7, 2002); bone mineral density (BMD), measured in a subset of women (n =
      1024) at baseline and years 1 and 3; and a global index, developed to summarize
      the balance of risks and benefits to test whether the risk-benefit profile
      differed across tertiles of fracture risk. RESULTS Seven hundred thirty-three
      women (8.6%) in the estrogen-plus-progestin group and 896 women (11.1%) in the
      placebo group experienced a fracture (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.69-0.83). The effect did not differ in women stratified by age, 
      body mass index, smoking status, history of falls, personal and family history of
      fracture, total calcium intake, past use of hormone therapy, BMD, or summary
      fracture risk score. Total hip BMD increased 3.7% after 3 years of treatment with
      estrogen plus progestin compared with 0.14% in the placebo group (P.001). The HR
      for the global index was similar across tertiles of the fracture risk scale
      (lowest fracture risk tertile, HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.93-1.58; middle tertile, HR,
      1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.46; highest tertile, HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.88-1.24) (P for
      interaction =.54). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that estrogen plus
      progestin increases BMD and reduces the risk of fracture in healthy
      postmenopausal women. The decreased risk of fracture attributed to estrogen plus 
      progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women examined. When
      considering the effects of hormone therapy on other important disease outcomes in
      a global model, there was no net benefit, even in women considered to be at high 
      risk of fracture.

TI  - Ultralow-dose micronized 17beta-estradiol and bone density and bone metabolism in
      older women a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1042-8
AB  - CONTEXT Estrogen therapy is known to prevent osteoporosis, but studies have
      shown that conventional doses increase adverse events. Whether lower doses, one
      quarter of standard treatment, prevent bone loss is not known. OBJECTIVE To
      examine the effect of 3 years of treatment with 0.25 mgd of micronized
      17beta-estradiol on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover in healthy older
      postmenopausal women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from July 24, 1998, through June
      14, 2002, at a university general clinical research center in the United States. 
      Healthy, community-dwelling women (N = 167) who were older than 65 years at
      enrollment. INTERVENTION Dosage of 0.25 mgd of micronized 17beta-estradiol (n =
      83) or placebo (n = 84); all women who had not had a hysterectomy received 100
      mgd of oral micronized progesterone for 2-week periods every 6 months. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES The BMD of the hip, spine, wrist, and total body measured
      annually for 3 years. Serum and urine biochemical markers of bone resorption and 
      formation and sex hormones were measured at baseline, 3 months, and during years 
      1 and 3 of treatment. RESULTS Mean BMD increased at all sites for participants
      taking low-dose estrogen (17beta-estradiol) compared with placebo (P.001).
      Compared with participants receiving placebo, participants taking low-dose
      estrogen had BMD increases of 2.6% for the femoral neck; 3.6%, total hip; 2.8%,
      spine; and 1.2%, total body. Markers of bone turnover, N-telopeptides of type 1
      collagen, and bone alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly (P.001) in
      participants taking low-dose estrogen compared with placebo. Estradiol, estrone, 
      and sex hormone-binding globulin levels increased in the estrogen-treated group
      compared with placebo. The adverse effect profile was similar; specifically,
      there were no statistically significant differences in breast tenderness, changes
      in endometrial thickness or pathological effects, or annual mammographic results 
      between the 2 groups. The number of abnormal mammograms over 3 years was 15 for
      the low-dose estrogen group and 10 for the placebo group (8 occurred at baseline)
      (P =.26). There were no reports of breast cancer during the study. CONCLUSIONS
      In older women, a dosage of 0.25 mgd of 17beta-estradiol increased bone density 
      of the hip, spine, and total body, and reduced bone turnover, with minimal
      adverse effects. Future studies evaluating the effect of low-dose estrogen on
      fractures are indicated.

TI  - Effect of combined oral estrogenprogestogen preparation (Kliogest) on bone
      mineral density, plasma lipids and postmenopausal symptoms in HRT-naive Thai
      women.
PG  - 857-66
AB  - BACKGROUND Kliogest is commonly prescribed for the relief of acute
      postmenopausal symptoms and prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. However,
      there have been few data on its effect in Asian women. METHODS This 1-year,
      single-center, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study evaluated
      the efficacy and safety of Kliogest in hormone replacement therapy (HRT)-naive
      Thai women. The subjects were 120 healthy Thai women aged between 45 and 65
      years, with intact uterus, and who had been amenorrheic for at least 1 year.
      RESULTS Kliogest increased spine (+ 6%, p  0.01) and hip (+2%, p  0.01) bone
      mineral density (BMD), and lowered plasma total cholesterol (TC) (-16%, p  0.05)
      and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (-16%, p  0.05) concentrations. 
      However, Kliogest also resulted in a decrease in high density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration (-18%, p  0.05). Compared to placebo, the
      reduction in menopausal symptoms by Kliogest was not statistically significant.
      The frequency and severity of treatment-related uterine bleeding decreased with
      the duration of Kliogest treatment. Furthermore, there was a fairly strong
      relationship between the change in serum estrone concentration and the average
      monthly weighted bleeding scores over the first 6 months (Spearman's correlation 
      r = 0.54; p  0.001), which became weaker over the entire treatment period
      (Spearman's correlation r = 0.27; p  0.01). Although there was a small to
      moderate relationship between baseline estrone concentration and both lumbar (r =
      0.23, p  0.02) and hip (r = 0.20, p  0.05) BMD, there was no significant
      relationship between Kliogest-induced change in estrone concentration and change 
      in lumbar and hip BMD. CONCLUSIONS Continuous treatment with Kliogest for 1 year
      reversed the potential postmenopausal bone loss in HRT-naive Thai postmenopausal 
      women. However, its effect on cardiovascular risk is uncertain. Furthermore,
      Kliogest is safe but appears to have no significant effect on climacteric
      symptoms in the patients in the present study.

PG  - 118-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE To compare a novel vaginal ring releasing estradiol acetate (Menoring;
      Galen Holdings) with oral estradiol for relief of moderate to severe vasomotor
      symptoms in healthy postmenopausal women. DESIGN This was a prospective,
      double-blind, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study. METHOD Women (n =
      159) aged  65 years experiencing or= 20 hot flushesnight sweats per week
      received either a vaginal ring releasing estradiol acetate at a rate equivalent
      to 50 microgday estradiol plus placebo tablets or oral estradiol 1 mgday plus a
      placebo vaginal ring for 24 weeks. For patients with inadequate control of
      symptoms, the dosage was doubled at 12 weeks. A 24-week, open-label extension of 
      the vaginal ring treatment followed double-blind treatment. RESULTS The
      frequency of hot flushesnight sweats was significantly reduced (p  0.001) in
      both groups at 12 and 24 weeks from baseline, by 84% and 94% for the vaginal ring
      group and by 73% and 83% for the oral group, respectively. The mean intensity of 
      urogenital symptoms decreased from screening to the end of treatment in both
      groups. The incidence of adverse events was similar for both groups. No
      clinically relevant local effects of the vaginal ring were observed. CONCLUSIONS
      The vaginal ring relieved both systemic and urogenital symptoms and was well
      tolerated and accepted. Overall, the efficacy, safety and acceptability of the
      vaginal ring were comparable with those of oral estradiol therapy.

TI  - Postmenopausal femur bone loss effects of a low dose hormone replacement
      therapy.
PG  - 175-83
AB  - OBJECTIVES Previous studies indicate that low-dose hormone replacement therapy
      (LD-HRT) can relieve vasomotor symptoms and prevent spine bone loss. METHODS In 
      the present study, we evaluated the effects of a low dose of conjugated equine
      estrogens (CEE; 0.3 mg) associated with different progestins in continuous
      combined scheme [2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n=25), 5 mg
      dydrogesterone (n=27), 2.5 mg nomegestrol (n=11)] as single group, on femur bone 
      mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism in young postmenopausal women (or=56
      years). All women were supplemented with 1 g of calcium per day, and compared
      with women treated with 1 g of calcium per day alone (control group, n=15). There
      were no significant differences in age, body mass index (BMI), hormone values,
      bone metabolism markers and femur BMD in the treatment and control groups before 
      the study. RESULTS In calcium-treated women serum plasma osteocalcin (BGP) and
      hydroxyprolinecreatinine urinary excretion (OHPCr) remained stable during all
      the observation period. In this group, femoral neck, Ward's triangle and
      trochanter BMD showed a progressive and significant (P0.05) decrease. In the
      LD-HRT group, a significant (P0.05) decrease in serum BGP and OHPCr was
      observed. In these women, the values of these markers of bone turnover at 36
      months were significantly (P0.01) different from those of calcium-treated women.
      During the LD-HRT administration, all BMD measures did not show any significant
      modifications. In these women, treated with LD-HRT the BMD values were
      significantly (P0.05) different from those measured in calcium-treated women in 
      all the femur sites of measurements. In the control group, BMI significantly
      (P0.05) increased from baseline value with a weight gain of 3%, while in the
      LD-HRT group, BMI did not change after 36 months of treatment and the 1.3% gain
      in body weight was not significant. LD-HRT was effective in reducing menopausal
      clinical symptoms and provided a favorable bleeding profile, and minimal side
      effects. CONCLUSION LD-HRT was effective in reducing menopausal clinical
      symptoms and minimal and transient side effects were reported. In addition, the
      0.30 mgday of CEE, in addition to a proper calcium supplementation, irrespective
      of the progestin used, can provide effective protection against activation of
      bone turnover and femur osteopenia.

TI  - Effect of low-dose transdermal E2NETA on the reduction of postmenopausal bone
      loss in women.
PG  - 241-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of a continuous-combined transdermal patch
      (estradiol norethisterone acetate [E(2)NETA] 25125; Estragest TTS, Novartis,
      Basel, Switzerland) in the reduction of bone loss in postmenopausal women.
      DESIGN In a 96-week, double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel study, 124 
      healthy women with an intact uterus more than 4 years after menopause received
      either transdermal continuous-combined E(2)NETA (0.0250.125 mgday) or placebo 
      patch for 24 treatment cycles; diet was normalized for calcium intake. Lumbar
      spine bone mineral density (BMD) ranged from 0.969 to 0.805 gcm2 with a mean
      annual BMD decrement ranging from 3% to 8% within the last 24 months. BMD at
      lumbar spine L(2)-L(4) (postero-anterior) and femur were assessed by dual energy 
      x-ray absorptiometry after 6, 12, and 24 cycles. Efficacy variables included
      measurement of biochemical markers of bone turnover (3, 6, 12, and 24 months).
      RESULTS BMD at lumbar spine was significantly higher at all time points in the
      E(2)NETA group than in the placebo group (P  0.0001). Significant increases in 
      BMD (P  0.0008) from baseline were observed at all sites after 24 months in the 
      E(2)NETA group compared with placebo, which demonstrated a decrease from
      baseline. At endpoint, statistically significant decrements in the values of bone
      remodeling markers were observed (P  0.05) with E(2)NETA. CONCLUSIONS
      E(2)NETA 25125 Estragest TTS was more effective than placebo in reducing the
      activation frequency of bone remodeling and in preventing bone loss at the spine 
      and hip. Effects on the hip were similar to those observed for higher doses of
      estrogen.

TI  - Effects of estrogen plus progestin on health-related quality of life.
PG  - 1839-54
AB  - BACKGROUND The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other clinical trials
      indicate that significant health risks are associated with combination hormone
      use. Less is known about the effect of hormone therapy on health-related quality 
      of life. METHODS The WHI randomly assigned 16,608 postmenopausal women 50 to 79 
      years of age (mean, 63) with an intact uterus at base line to estrogen plus
      progestin (0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg of
      medroxyprogesterone acetate, in 8506 women) or placebo (in 8102 women).
      Quality-of-life measures were collected at base line and at one year in all women
      and at three years in a subgroup of 1511 women. RESULTS Randomization to
      estrogen plus progestin resulted in no significant effects on general health,
      vitality, mental health, depressive symptoms, or sexual satisfaction. The use of 
      estrogen plus progestin was associated with a statistically significant but small
      and not clinically meaningful benefit in terms of sleep disturbance, physical
      functioning, and bodily pain after one year (the mean benefit in terms of sleep
      disturbance was 0.4 point on a 20-point scale, in terms of physical functioning
      0.8 point on a 100-point scale, and in terms of pain 1.9 points on a 100-point
      scale). At three years, there were no significant benefits in terms of any
      quality-of-life outcomes. Among women 50 to 54 years of age with
      moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms at base line, estrogen and progestin
      improved vasomotor symptoms and resulted in a small benefit in terms of sleep
      disturbance but no benefit in terms of the other quality-of-life outcomes.
      CONCLUSIONS In this trial in postmenopausal women, estrogen plus progestin did
      not have a clinically meaningful effect on health-related quality of life.

TI  - Combined hormone replacement therapy and risk of breast cancer in a French cohort
      study of 3175 women.
PG  - 332-40
AB  - The largest-to-date randomized trial (Women's Health Initiative) comparing the
      effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and a placebo concluded that the
      continuous use of an oral combination of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) and
      medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA) increases the risk of breast cancer. This
      conclusion may not apply to women taking other estrogen and progestin
      formulations, as suggested by discrepancies in the findings of in vitro studies, 
      epidemiological surveys and, mostly, in vivo studies of human breast epithelial
      cell proliferation showing opposite effects of HRT combining CEE plus MPA or
      estradiol plus progesterone. To evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated
      with the use of the latter combination, commonly prescribed in France, a cohort
      including 3175 postmenopausal women was followed for a mean of 8.9 years (28 367 
      woman-years). In total, 1739 (55%) of these women were users of one type of
      estrogen replacement with systemic effect during at least 12 months, any time
      after the menopause, and were classified as HRT users. Among them, 83% were
      receiving exclusively or mostly a combination of a transdermal estradiol gel and 
      a progestin other than MPA. Some 105 cases of breast cancer occurred during the
      follow-up period, corresponding to a mean of 37 new cases per 10 000 womenyear. 
      Using multivariate analysis adjusted for the calendar period of treatment, date
      of birth and age at menopause, we were unable to detect an increase in the
      relative risk (RR) of breast cancer (RR 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI)
      0.65-1.5) in the HRT users. The RR of breast cancer per year of use of HRT was
      1.005 (95% CI 0.97-1.05). These results do not justify early interruption of such
      a type of HRT, which is beneficial for quality of life, prevention of bone loss
      and cardiovascular risk profile, without the activation of coagulation and
      inflammatory protein synthesis measured in users of oral estrogens.

TI  - Effects of low-dose, continuous combined estradiol and noretisterone acetate on
      menopausal quality of life in early postmenopausal women.
PG  - 157-63
AB  - OBJECTIVES To describe the effects of low dose hormonal replacement therapy
      (LD-HRT) on quality of life in early postmenopausal women, since the
      postmenopausal estrogen deprivation in mid age women often brings along a series 
      of changes and symptoms, which may greatly affect quality of life. METHODS Fifty
      normal postmenopausal women were recruited and randomly treated with LD-HRT,
      17beta-estradiol (1 mgday) and norethisterone acetate (0.5 mgday) (LD-HRT) or
      calcium supplement (controls). No significant differences in age, age at
      menopause, the presence of chronic diseases and socio-economic status were
      present in the two groups. The Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ), a validated
      quality-of-life instrument for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, was
      administered at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment in both groups.
      RESULTS At baseline no significant differences in WHQ scores were present in the
      two groups. In the control group the scores in all different areas showed no
      significant modification either after 6 and 12 weeks of observation. Conversely, 
      the LD-HRT group showed a significant decrease in the scores of vasomotor
      symptoms, somatic symptoms, anxietyfear, depressed mood and sleep problem items.
      No effects on memoryconcentration and menstrual symptoms areas were evident.
      CONCLUSION Although quality of life is also and may be mainly influenced by
      socio-economic and cultural factors, LD-HRT definitively can improve not only
      vasomotor symptoms, but also more general aspects of physical and psychological
      well-being of symptomatic postmenopausal women.

      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a
      constant-estrogen, intermittent-progestogen hormone replacement regimen
      (Ortho-Prefest, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Raritan, NJ, USA) on menopausal
      symptoms measured by the Kupperman Index and on quality of life measured by the
      Menopause Quality of Life-Intervention questionnaire. DESIGN This was a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study of 90 days'
      duration. Nonhysterectomized, postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms and at
      least 6 months' amenorrhea were eligible. On completion of the placebo-controlled
      portion of the study, participants could elect to receive active treatment for an
      additional 90 days. RESULTS The study enrolled 119 participants, 59 and 60 in
      the Prefest and placebo groups, respectively. A marked reduction of menopausal
      symptoms, as measured by the Kupperman Index, was observed in the active
      treatment group compared with the placebo group after 45 days' treatment (mean
      reduction, 14.8 v 7.2 points, respectively), which was sustained to day 90 (16.8 
      v 7.8 points;  0.001). Similarly, greater improvement in quality of life, as
      measured by the Menopause Quality of Life summary score, was also observed in the
      active treatment group for the same period (improvement of up to 1.6 points v 0.7
      points;  0.001). The adverse event profile was unremarkable. Of the 114
      participants who received the active treatment, 6 withdrew because of adverse
      events. CONCLUSIONS The constant-estrogen, intermittent-progestogen regimen was 
      highly effective in relieving menopausal symptoms and in improving quality of
      life and was well received by the study participants.

TI  - Effectiveness of Alora estradiol matrix transdermal delivery system in improving 
      lumbar bone mineral density in healthy, postmenopausal women.
PG  - 343-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE To determine the lowest effective dose of an estradiol (E )
      matrix-type transdermal delivery system (EMTDS; Alora) for preventing bone loss
      in postmenopausal women. DESIGN This double-blind, double-dummy, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study enrolled 355 nonosteoporotic postmenopausal
      women who had been hysterectomized with or without oophorectomy at least 12
      months earlier. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three doses of the 
      EMTDS (0.025, 0.05, or 0.075 mgday) or placebo administered twice weekly. Lumbar
      bone mineral density (LBMD) was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at
      screening and after 1 and 2 years of treatment. Safety was assessed at regularly 
      scheduled visits. RESULTS EMTDS provided statistically significant and
      clinically meaningful changes in LBMD relative to placebo. At 2 years, LBMD
      declined from baseline by 0.59% in the placebo group, but it increased from
      baseline by 1.65% ( = 0.0065), 4.08% ( = 0.0001), and 4.82% ( = 0.0001) in the
      EMTDS 0.025, 0.05, and 0.075 mgday groups, respectively. The corresponding
      responder rates (defined as no change or increase in LBMD at endpoint) were 39.7%
      for placebo, 59.6%, 79.3%, and 83.9% in the EMTDS 0.025, 0.05, and 0.075 mgday
      groups, respectively. Mean serum E concentrations were proportional to the dose
      of the E transdermal system and did not accumulate over the course of the study. 
      Adverse events were generally comparable across treatment groups, with the
      majority being mild or moderate in severity and unrelated to study medication.
      Mammogram findings and other safety assessments were also comparable across
      groups and did not reveal any safety concerns with 2-y transdermal E treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS The EMTDS (Alora) administered twice weekly improves lumbar bone
      mineral density in healthy postmenopausal women, with the benefit of treatment
      evident by 1 year. The lowest effective dose is 0.025 mgday.

TI  - Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women
      principal results From the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 321-33
AB  - CONTEXT Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of
      risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains
      uncertain. OBJECTIVE To assess the major health benefits and risks of the most
      commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States. DESIGN Estrogen
      plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized
      controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16608 
      postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were
      recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998. INTERVENTIONS Participants
      received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mgd, plus medroxyprogesterone
      acetate, 2.5 mgd, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102). MAIN OUTCOMES
      MEASURES The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal
      myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary 
      adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits
      included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial
      cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes. RESULTS 
      On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety
      monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs
      placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the
      stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic
      supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major
      clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 
      95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286
      cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85)
      with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63
      (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases;
      hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes,
      0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for
      composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease
      (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76
      (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and
      1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000
      person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8
      more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk
      reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer
      hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index
      was 19 per 10 000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS Overall health risks exceeded
      benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year
      follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not
      affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not
      consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention
      of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be
      initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.

TI  - Menopausal hormone replacement therapy and risk of ovarian cancer.
PG  - 334-41
AB  - CONTEXT The association between menopausal hormone replacement therapy and
      ovarian cancer is unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine whether hormone replacement
      therapy using estrogen only, estrogen-progestin only, or both estrogen only and
      estrogen-progestin increases ovarian cancer risk. DESIGN A 1979-1998 cohort
      study of former participants in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration
      Project, a nationwide breast cancer screening program. SETTING Twenty-nine US
      clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS A total of 44 241 postmenopausal women (mean age 
      at start of follow-up, 56.6 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incident ovarian
      cancer. RESULTS We identified 329 women who developed ovarian cancer during
      follow-up. In time-dependent analyses adjusted for age, menopause type, and oral 
      contraceptive use, ever use of estrogen only was significantly associated with
      ovarian cancer (rate ratio [RR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.0).
      Increasing duration of estrogen-only use was significantly associated with
      ovarian cancer RRs for 10 to 19 years and 20 or more years were 1.8 (95% CI,
      1.1-3.0) and 3.2 (95% CI, 1.7-5.7), respectively (P value for trend .001), and
      we observed a 7% (95% CI, 2%-13%) increase in RR per year of use. We observed
      significantly elevated RRs with increasing duration of estrogen-only use across
      all strata of other ovarian cancer risk factors, including women with
      hysterectomy. The RR for estrogen-progestin use after prior estrogen-only use was
      1.5 (95% CI, 0.91-2.4), but the RR for estrogen-progestin-only use was 1.1 (95%
      CI, 0.64-1.7). The RRs for less than 2 years and 2 or more years of
      estrogen-progestin-only use were 1.6 (95% CI, 0.78-3.3) and 0.80 (95% CI,
      0.35-1.8), respectively, and there was no evidence of a duration response (P
      value for trend =.30). CONCLUSION Women who used estrogen-only replacement
      therapy, particularly for 10 or more years, were at significantly increased risk 
      of ovarian cancer in this study. Women who used short-term
      estrogen-progestin-only replacement therapy were not at increased risk, but risk 
      associated with short-term and longer-term estrogen-progestin replacement therapy
      warrants further investigation.

TI  - Change in bone mass distribution induced by hormone replacement therapy and
      high-impact physical exercise in post-menopausal women.
PG  - 126-35
AB  - The purpose of this intervention trial was to determine whether changes in bone
      mass distribution could be observed in postmenopausal women following hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT) andor high-impact physical exercise. Eighty healthy
      women, aged 50-57 years, at 5 years after the onset of menopause and with no
      previous use of HRT, were randomly assigned to one of four groups HRT; exercise 
      (Ex); HRT + Ex (ExHRT); and control (Co). HRT administration was conducted in a
      double-blind manner for 1 year using estradiol plus noretisterone acetate
      (Kliogest). The exercise groups participated in a 1 year progressive training
      program consisting of jumping and bounding activities. Subjects participated in
      two supervised sessions per week and were asked to perform a series of exercises 
      at home 4 daysweek. Bone measurements using a quantitative computed tomography
      scanner (Somatom DR, Siemens) were obtained from the proximal femur, midfemur,
      proximal tibia, and tibial shaft. Data were analyzed with a software program
      (BONALYSE 1.3) calculating density (gcm(3)), cross-sectional area (CSA; mm(2)), 
      and moments of inertia (I(max), I(min), I(polar)). In addition, the bone mass
      spectrum was determined as a function of the angular distribution around the bone
      mass center (polar distribution) and the distance from the bone mass center
      through the diaphyseal wall (radial distribution). After the 1 year period, there
      was an overall interaction of group x time in bone mineral density (BMD) at the
      proximal femur (p = 0.05) and tibial shaft (p = 0.035). Women in the ExHRT and
      HRT groups had increased proximal femur and tibial shaft BMD when compared with
      the change observed in the Co group (p = 0.024-0.011). The change was more
      pronounced in the cortical tibia, wherein the ExHRT group also differed from the 
      Ex group (p = 0.038). No significant changes were found in bone CSA at any of the
      measured sites. The radial distribution indicated an increase of BMD in the
      endocortical part of the measured sites in the HRT and ExHRT groups and in the
      proximal tibia in the Ex group. The polar distribution showed that bone mass was 
      redistributed in the anteroposterior direction. The changes in I(max), I(min),
      and I(polar) in the HRT and ExHRT groups differed from those in the Co group at
      the proximal femur, midfemur, and proximal tibia (p = 0.047-0.001). The Ex group 
      also differed from the Co group in I(max) and I(polar) at the proximal tibia (p =
      0.018 and 0.039, respectively). These results support the idea that HRT acts
      primarily at the bone-marrow interface. The exercise intervention chosen for this
      study contributed to the maintenance of bone mass. Our results suggest that both 
      HRT and exercise have local effects on bone mass. The change in bone mass
      distribution induced by HRT and exercise may play an important role in the
      alteration of bone strength.

TI  - Noncardiovascular disease outcomes during 6.8 years of hormone therapy Heart and
      Estrogenprogestin Replacement Study follow-up (HERS II).
PG  - 58-66
AB  - CONTEXT The Heart and Estrogenprogestin Replacement Study (HERS) was a
      randomized trial of estrogen plus progestin therapy after menopause. OBJECTIVE
      To examine the effect of long-term postmenopausal hormone therapy on common
      noncardiovascular disease outcomes. DESIGN AND SETTING Randomized, blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial of 4.1 years' duration (HERS) and subsequent open-label 
      observational follow-up for 2.7 years (HERS II), carried out between 1993 and
      2000 in outpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers.
      PARTICIPANTS A total of 2763 postmenopausal women with coronary disease and
      average age of 67 years at enrollment in HERS; 2321 women (93% of those
      surviving) consented to follow-up in HERS II. INTERVENTION Participants were
      randomly assigned to receive 0.625 mgd of conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 1380) or placebo (n = 1383) during HERS;
      open-label hormone therapy was prescribed at personal physicians' discretion
      during HERS II. The proportions with at least 80% adherence to hormones declined 
      from 81% (year 1) to 45% (year 6) in the hormone group and increased from 0%
      (year 1) to 8% (year 6) in the placebo group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
      Thromboembolic events, biliary tract surgery, cancer, fracture, and total
      mortality. RESULTS Comparing women assigned to hormone therapy with those
      assigned to placebo, the unadjusted intention-to-treat relative hazard (RH) for
      venous thromboembolism declined from 2.66 (95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.41-5.04) during HERS to 1.40 (95% CI, 0.64-3.05) during HERS II (P for time
      trend =.08); it was 2.08 overall for the 6.8 years (95% CI, 1.28-3.40), and 3 of 
      the 73 women with thromboembolism died within 30 days due to pulmonary embolism. 
      The overall RH for biliary tract surgery was 1.48 (95% CI, 1.12-1.95); for any
      cancer, 1.19 (95% CI, 0.95-1.50); and for any fracture, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.87-1.25).
      There were 261 deaths among those assigned to hormone therapy and 239 among those
      assigned to placebo (RH, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.92-1.31). Adjusted and as-treated
      analyses did not alter our conclusions. CONCLUSIONS Treatment for 6.8 years with
      estrogen plus progestin in older women with coronary disease increased the rates 
      of venous thromboembolism and biliary tract surgery. Trends in other disease
      outcomes were not favorable and should be assessed in larger trials and in
      broader populations.

TI  - Cardiovascular disease outcomes during 6.8 years of hormone therapy Heart and
      Estrogenprogestin Replacement Study follow-up (HERS II).
PG  - 49-57
AB  - CONTEXT The Heart and Estrogenprogestin Replacement Study (HERS) found no
      overall reduction in risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events among
      postmenopausal women with CHD. However, in the hormone group, findings did
      suggest a higher risk of CHD events during the first year, and a decreased risk
      during years 3 to 5. OBJECTIVE To determine if the risk reduction observed in
      the later years of HERS persisted and resulted in an overall reduced risk of CHD 
      events with additional years of follow-up. DESIGN AND SETTING Randomized,
      blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 4.1 years' duration (HERS) and subsequent
      unblinded follow-up for 2.7 years (HERS II) conducted at outpatient and community
      settings at 20 US clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS A total of 2763 postmenopausal 
      women with CHD and average age of 67 years at enrollment in HERS; 2321 women (93%
      of those surviving) consented to follow-up in HERS II. INTERVENTION Participants
      were randomly assigned to receive 0.625 mgd of conjugated estrogens and 2.5 mg
      of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 1380), or placebo (n = 1383) during HERS;
      open-label hormone therapy was prescribed at personal physicians' discretion
      during HERS II. The proportions with at least 80% adherence to hormones declined 
      from 81% (year 1) to 45% (year 6) in the hormone group, and increased from 0%
      (year 1) to 8% (year 6) in the placebo group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary 
      outcome was nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death. Secondary
      cardiovascular events were coronary revascularization, hospitalization for
      unstable angina or congestive heart failure, nonfatal ventricular arrhythmia,
      sudden death, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial
      disease. RESULTS There were no significant decreases in rates of primary CHD
      events or secondary cardiovascular events among women assigned to the hormone
      group compared with the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, or overall. The
      unadjusted relative hazard (RH) for CHD events in HERS was 0.99 (95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.81-1.22); HERS II, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.77-1.29); and overall, 0.99
      (0.84-1.17). The overall RHs were similar after adjustment for potential
      confounders and differential use of statins between treatment groups (RH, 0.97;
      95% CI, 0.82-1.14), and in analyses restricted to women who were adherent to
      randomized treatment assignment (RH, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19). CONCLUSIONS Lower
      rates of CHD events among women in the hormone group in the final years of HERS
      did not persist during additional years of follow-up. After 6.8 years, hormone
      therapy did not reduce risk of cardiovascular events in women with CHD.
      Postmenopausal hormone therapy should not be used to reduce risk for CHD events
      in women with CHD.

TI  - Alveolar and postcranial bone density in postmenopausal women receiving
      hormoneestrogen replacement therapy a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1409-15
AB  - BACKGROUND We conducted a 3-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
      study to determine whether the positive effects of hormoneestrogen replacement
      therapy (HERT) on postcranial bone density are accompanied by similar positive
      effects on oral bone mass. METHODS A total of 135 postmenopausal women (aged
      41-70 years) with no evidence of moderate or severe periodontal disease were
      randomized to receive daily oral conjugated estrogen (Premarin; 0.625 mg) alone
      or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (Prempro; 0.625 and 2.5 mg,
      respectively) or placebo. All subjects received calcium carbonate (1000 mgd) and
      cholecalciferol (400 [corrected] IUd) supplements. The primary efficacy end
      points were the changes in alveolar crest height and alveolar bone density.
      Alveolar crest height was measured on bite-wing radiographs, and changes in
      alveolar bone mass were assessed by means of digital-subtraction radiography.
      Postcranial bone density was measured in the lumbar spine and left proximal femur
      by means of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS Hormoneestrogen
      replacement therapy significantly increased alveolar bone mass compared with
      placebo (+1.84% vs +0.95% [P =.04]), and tended to improve alveolar crest height 
      (+4.83% vs +3.46% [P =.34]). Bone mineral density of the proximal femur
      significantly increased in the HERT compared with the placebo group (total
      proximal femur, +3.59% vs +0.22% [P =.001]; neck, +2.05% vs -0.34% [P =.02];
      trochanter, +3.49% vs +0.08% [P.001]), but not the lumbar spine (+1.01% vs
      +0.17% [P =.39]). Changes in alveolar bone mass correlated with bone density
      changes in the total femur (r = 0.28 [P =.02]) and femoral trochanter (r = 0.25
      [P =.04]) in the HERT but not in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS Postcranial and
      oral bone mass were increased in postmenopausal women receiving HERT.
      Improvement in oral bone health constitutes an additional benefit of HERT.

TI  - Effect of lower doses of conjugated equine estrogens with and without
      medroxyprogesterone acetate on bone in early postmenopausal women.
PG  - 2668-76
AB  - CONTEXT Lower-than-commonly-prescribed doses of conjugated equine estrogens
      (CEEs) with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) improve vasomotor symptoms and
      vaginal atrophy, provide acceptable bleeding and lipid profiles, and afford
      endometrial protection. This lower-dose therapy's protection against loss of bone
      mineral density (BMD) associated with menopause has not been thoroughly
      investigated. OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of lower doses of CEEs only or 
      CEEs-MPA on spine and hip BMD, total body bone mineral content (BMC), and
      biochemical markers of bone turnover in postmenopausal women. DESIGN AND SETTING
      Two-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled substudy of the Women's
      Health, Osteoporosis, Progestin, Estrogen trial, conducted at 19 US centers
      between August 1995 and October 2000. PARTICIPANTS Eight hundred twenty-two
      healthy postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years who were within 4 years of their
      last menstrual period. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive 
      CEEs, 0.625; CEEs, 0.625 and MPA, 2.5; CEEs, 0.45; CEEs, 0.45 and MPA, 2.5; CEEs,
      0.45 and MPA, 1.5; CEEs, 0.3; CEEs 0.3 and MPA, 1.5 (all doses in mgd); or
      placebo for 2 years. All participants also received elemental calcium at 600
      mgd. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Changes from baseline in spine and total hip BMD,
      total body BMC, and biochemical markers of bone turnover (serum osteocalcin and
      urinary cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen), assessed at 6-month
      intervals and compared among treatment groups with a modified intention-to-treat 
      approach. RESULTS At 24 months, women assigned to all of the active treatment
      groups had significant gains from baseline (P.001) in spine and hip BMD and
      total body BMC (except total body BMC in the group receiving CEEs, 0.3 mgd).
      These changes were significantly different from those in the placebo group, in
      which losses of bone mass in spine and total body were evident over the course of
      the study (P.001). The loss in hip BMD from baseline in the placebo group was
      significant at 18 (P =.02) but not at 24 months (P =.06). Osteocalcin and
      N-telopeptides of type I collagen were significantly reduced from baseline
      (P.001) for all active treatment groups at all time points; no changes were
      found for the placebo group. For women treated with CEEs alone, the gains in
      spine BMD for the group taking CEEs, 0.625 mgd, were significantly higher than
      those of the group taking CEEs, 0.3 mgd (P =.02), but not the group treated with
      CEEs, 0.45 mgd (P =.48). CONCLUSIONS Doses of CEEs or CEEs-MPA lower than 0.625
      mgd effectively increase BMD and BMC in early postmenopausal women.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of a continuous once-a-week 17beta-estradiollevonorgestrel
      transdermal system and its effects on vasomotor symptoms and endometrial safety
      in postmenopausal women the results of two multicenter, double-blind,
      randomized, controlled trials.
PG  - 195-207
AB  - OBJECTIVE Two prospective multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled
      trials were conducted to examine the safety and efficacy of three once-a-week
      continuous combined 17beta-estradiollevonorgestrel (E2LNG) transdermal systems 
      (E2 0.045 mgday with 0.015, 0.030, and 0.040 mgday LNG) for the treatment of
      vasomotor symptoms and prevention of estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia in 
      healthy, postmenopausal women. DESIGN In study 1, performed in 293
      hysterectomized and nonhysterectomized women with moderate to severe hot flushes,
      transdermal E2LNG (E2 0.045 mgday with 0.030 and 0.040 mgday LNG) was compared
      with placebo for three 28-day treatment cycles. The frequency and severity of hot
      flushes were recorded daily. In study 2, performed in 845 women with intact
      uteri, transdermal E2LNG (E2 0.045 mgday with 0.015, 0.030, and 0.040 mgday
      LNG) was compared with transdermal E2 0.045 mgday monotherapy for thirteen
      28-day treatment cycles. Women with endometrial tissue sufficient for evaluation 
      underwent endometrial biopsy assessment at the end of cycle 13. Bleeding patterns
      were assessed throughout the study, and the Women's Health Questionnaire was used
      to assess well-being. RESULTS In study 1, transdermal E2LNG (E2 0.045 mgday
      with 0.030 and 0.040 mgday LNG) significantly decreased the number and severity 
      of hot flushes when compared with placebo. Symptom relief was seen as early as 2 
      weeks posttreatment. Similarly, in study 2, all three doses of transdermal E2LNG
      and E2 controlled hot flushes with no differences between groups. In study 2, no 
      women receiving transdermal E2LNG developed endometrial hyperplasia compared
      with 19 (12.8%) who received transdermal E2 0.045 mgday (p  0.001 for each
      dose). Significant improvements from baseline in scores on the Women's Health
      Questionnaire for vasomotor symptoms, sleep problems, sexual function, cognitive 
      difficulties, and total score were noted at all or most time points with both
      transdermal E2LNG and E2. Application-site reactions, vaginal hemorrhage, and
      breast pain were the most common adverse events reported with transdermal E2LNG.
      The proportion of women with amenorrhea increased over time in all treatment
      groups in study 2. CONCLUSIONS All three doses of this once-a-week combined
      E2LNG transdermal system rapidly and effectively control vasomotor symptoms in
      postmenopausal women while protecting against endometrial hyperplasia.
      Amelioration of vasomotor symptoms also is accompanied by improvements in aspects
      of subjective well-being. Once-a-week transdermal E2LNG, therefore, offers an
      effective and convenient formulation, the dosing of which can be individualized
      according to the needs of each patient.

TI  - Effects of period-free hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women in
      Taiwan.
PG  - 23-8
AB  - BACKGROUND To compare the effects of continuous combined hormone replacement
      therapy (Kliogest) and placebo on climacteric symptoms, bone turnover markers,
      serum lipid profiles and the safety of Kliogest. METHODS This is a 4-month,
      single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. Fifty-six healthy
      volunteer women with intact uterus, between six months and three years after a
      natural menopause, were recruited and randomised into two groups to have blood
      and urine laboratory test for assessment of bone resorption marker of
      deoxypyridinoline, bone formation marker of bone specific alkaline phosphatase,
      lipid profile including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density 
      lipoprotein and triglyceride, and menopausal symptoms. Information was taken at
      initial visit and 1, 2 and final follow-up after taking medication. RESULTS
      Continuous Kliogest treatment resulted in significant reduction in menopausal
      symptoms, as scored by Integrated Greene Climacteric Scale and in the
      psychological, somatic and vasomotor subscales scores (p = 0.009). Kliogest
      reversed the negative trends in lipoprotein profiles by lowering total
      cholesterol (p  0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p  0.001), and
      triglyceride (p = 0.004), but decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p 
      = 0.002). A significant reduction in bone resorption marker, deoxypyridinoline,
      was also observed in the Kliogest group (p  0.001). There was no report of
      serious adverse events, endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in the Kliogest treated
      patients. CONCLUSIONS Four-month treatment with Kliogest resulted in an
      improvement in menopausal symptoms and lipid profiles as well as reduction in
      bone loss.

TI  - Effect of 1 year of discontinuation of raloxifene or estrogen therapy on bone
      mineral density after 5 years of treatment in healthy postmenopausal women.
PG  - 599-603
AB  - The beneficial effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), selective estrogen
      receptor modulators (SERMs), or bisphosphonates in the prevention and treatment
      of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women have been well established. However,
      little is known about the effects of discontinuation of treatment on bone mineral
      density. We investigated the effect of 1 year of discontinuation of the SERM
      raloxifene (Ral; 60 mg and 150 mg), conjugated equine estrogen (CEE; 0.625 mg),
      and placebo after 5 years of treatment in a double-blind, randomized study.
      Thirty-eight of 59 healthy and hysterectomized postmenopausal women (mean age 55 
      years) completed the treatment and 1 year follow-up period. Lumbar spine and
      femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) were performed with dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry, before, during, and at the end of treatment, as well as after 1
      year of discontinuation of therapy. One year of discontinuation significantly
      reduced the mean lumbar spine BMD in the raloxifene- and estrogen-treated women
      (p  0.05), whereas mean femoral neck BMD was reduced significantly only in women
      treated with 60 mg Ral (p  0.05). The mean percentage change (+-SD) in lumbar
      spine BMD was CEE, -6.2% (+-3.7%); Ral 60 mg, -2.4% (+-2.4%); Ral 150 mg,
      -2.6% (+-3.1%); and placebo, -1.6% (+-4.3%). Our results show that 5 years of
      treatment with either Ral or CEE did not protect against bone loss after 1 year
      of withdrawal of therapy, and that the rate of bone loss was not significantly
      different from that of placebo-treated women.

TI  - Comparison of Alora estradiol matrix transdermal delivery system with oral
      conjugated equine estrogen therapy in relieving menopausal symptoms. Alora Study 
      Group.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of two strengths of an estradiol matrix
      transdermal delivery system with daily oral doses of conjugated equine estrogens 
      in reducing the frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flushes in postmenopausal
      women. DESIGN The design of the study provided for the following treatment
      regimens an estradiol transdermal delivery system (Alora 0.05 or 0.1 mgday)
      administered twice weekly or oral doses of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE 0.625
      or 1.25 mg) administered daily were given to 321 highly symptomatic
      postmenopausal women for 12 weeks following a randomized, parallel-group,
      double-blind, double-dummy design. RESULTS Results indicate no statistically
      significant differences at any time point in mean frequency or mean percentage
      reduction in frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flushes between patients given
      Alora 0.1 mgday and those receiving CEE 1.25 mgday. Similarly, no significant
      differences were observed at any time in mean frequency of moderate-to-severe hot
      flushes between the Alora 0.05 mgday and CEE 0.625 mgday groups, although the
      group receiving CEE 0.625 mgday exhibited a statistically greater percentage
      reduction than the Alora 0.05 mgday group at weeks 3, 4 and 8. By week 12, these
      two treatments were statistically indistinguishable. There were no serious or
      unexpected adverse events with the two transdermal systems and local skin
      tolerability was excellent. Other estrogenic effects such as restoration of
      vaginal cytology, breast tenderness and unexpected vaginal bleeding were
      comparable between transdermal and oral administration groups except for a lower 
      incidence of bleeding in those women receiving the lower dose transdermal
      regimen.

TI  - Bone mass response to discontinuation of long-term hormone replacement therapy
      results from the Postmenopausal EstrogenProgestin Interventions (PEPI) Safety
      Follow-up Study.
PG  - 665-72
AB  - BACKGROUND Accelerated bone loss after stopping hormone therapy (HRT) is
      postulated to explain the lack of hip-fracture protection conferred by former HRT
      use. The abbreviation HRT (traditionally standing for hormone replacement
      therapy) is used herein because of its wide recognition in the field. However,
      the pharmacological doses of estrogens and progestins used are not truly
      replacement in nature. OBJECTIVES To determine whether women lose bone mineral
      density (BMD) after stopping HRT; to assess whether their rate of loss is
      significantly greater than that of women not undergoing HRT; and to determine
      whether long-term HRT is associated with continued gains in BMD. METHODS A total
      of 495 women who were adherent to assigned treatment in the 3-year Postmenopausal
      EstrogenProgestin Interventions randomized controlled trial (PEPI-RCT) and who
      had an additional BMD measurement during the PEPI Safety Follow-up Study were
      observed for an average of 3 years during and 4 years after the PEPI-RCT.
      RESULTS Women who stopped HRT after 1 year during the PEPI-RCT had annual rates 
      of BMD change of -0.54% (hip) and -0.81% (spine) during the following 2 years.
      Those who underwent HRT for 3 years during the PEPI-RCT and then discontinued it 
      had annual changes of -1.01% (hip) and -1.04% (spine). Rates of BMD loss among
      women who stopped HRT during or after the PEPI-RCT did not differ significantly
      from those of women who did not undergo HRT, who lost bone at a rate of
      approximately 1% yearly during the first year of the PEPI-RCT and about half that
      rate afterward. Women who continued HRT after the PEPI-RCT did not show
      additional BMD gains. CONCLUSIONS Our results do not support the hypothesis that
      bone is lost at an unusually fast rate after discontinuation of HRT, nor do they 
      suggest that longer-term HRT leads to additional BMD gain beyond that evident
      after 3 years.

      menopausal symptoms and quality of life in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 176-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE To study the impact of low-dose unopposed esterified estrogens on
      menopausal symptoms and quality of life. METHODS In a long-term, 2-year,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 204 postmenopausal women were
      treated with esterified estrogens 0.3 mg daily or placebo. Menopausal symptoms
      were assessed with a modified Kupperman index at baseline, 3, 6 and thereafter
      every 6 months. In a second 12-week, open-label, short-term pilot study, 25
      postmenopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms were treated with
      esterified estrogens 0.3 mg daily for 12 weeks. Vasomotor symptoms and quality of
      life were assessed using the Greene scale and Quality of Life Menopause Scale
      (QUALMS). RESULTS In the long-term study, significant (p  0.05) reductions in
      total symptom scores were observed at each time point with esterified estrogens
      compared with placebo. Somatic symptom scores (hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal
      dryness) decreased significantly (p  0.01) in patients treated with esterified
      estrogens 0.3 mg compared to baseline and placebo. In the short-term, open-label 
      pilot study, the incidence of vasomotor symptoms was significantly (p  0.01)
      reduced with esterified estrogens 0.3 mg from week 4 until the study end.
      Significant (p  0.05) improvements versus baseline were seen in the somatic and 
      vasomotorsleep domains and in the total quality-of-life score. CONCLUSIONS
      Esterified estrogens 0.3 mg given daily provide adequate menopausal symptom
      relief and improved quality of life in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Effects of transdermal estradiol delivered by a matrix patch on bone density in
      hysterectomized, postmenopausal women a 2-year placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 176-83
AB  - This 2-year, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was designed to 
      evaluate the safety and efficacy in preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women 
      of two doses of transdermal 17betaestradiol (estradiol) delivered by a matrix
      patch, compared with placebo. One hundred and sixty healthy, hysterectomized
      postmenopausal volunteers aged 40-60 years with serum estradiol levels  20 pgml
      were started on treatment at four centers in The Netherlands. Every 6 months,
      bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
      at the lumbar spine, non-dominant wrist and left hip, and markers of bone
      turnover were assessed in urine and serum. The treatment arms were estradiol,
      100 microgday (E-100, n = 53), oestradiol, 50 microgday (E-50, n = 54), placebo
      (P-100, placebo to E-100, n = 27 or P-50, placebo to E-50, n = 26). Treatment was
      continued for up to 2 years. After 24 months, BMD of the lumbar spine in the
      E-100 group differed by 7.7% [5.8-9.5%] (mean [95% confidence interval]) from the
      placebo group and showed a mean (s.e.m.) increase in BMD from baseline of 5.9%
      (0.69%). For the E-50 group the difference compared with placebo was 6.2%
      [4.4-8.0%] and the absolute increase was 4.5% (0.62%); in the placebo group, the 
      absolute change was -2.3% (0.48%). In the total wrist, the changes were E-100
      difference compared with placebo 2.5% [1.5 3.6%], absolute increase 0.6% (0.3%); 
      E-50 difference compared with placebo 2.9% [1.8-3.9%], absolute increase 0.7%
      (0.25%); and absolute change on placebo -2.5% (0.35%). In the total hip, the
      changes were E-100 difference compared with placebo 3.7% [2.2-5.2%], absolute
      increase 2.8% (0.5%); E-50 difference compared with placebo 3.2% [1,8-4.7%],
      absolute change 2.4% (0.36%); and absolute change on placebo -1.4% (0.66%). Three
      markers of bone turnover--serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum
      osteocalcin and urinary CTX--fell significantly during the trial. Breast pain was
      reported by 8% of women on placebo, by 6% of women on E-50 and by 17% of women on
      E-100. Estradiol delivered by the E-50 matrix patch effectively reversed bone
      loss in hysterectomized postmenopausal women with few side-effects. The marginal 
      additional gain in BMD with the higher dose may be offset by a more important
      side effect profile.

      were assessed before and after treatment. Subpopulation analysis according to
      menopausal status was performed. RESULTS Both combinations significantly reduced
      the number and severity of hot flushes, compared to placebo. A reduction of
      approximately 85% in vasomotor symptomatology occurred in the two combination
      groups by week 4 of treatment, and this was further diminished throughout the
      study to approximately 97% reduction by week 12. At the end of the study, 85% of 
      the women receiving 1 mg E20.5 mg NETA and 71% of the women receiving 1 mg
      E20.25 mg NETA were considered to the clinically adequate responders to
      treatment. Both combinations were associated with significant improvements,
      compared to placebo, in visual analog scales for overall general condition,
      Kupperman Menopausal Index, and Greene Climacteric vasomotor and psychological
      subscales. While both combinations resulted in similar bleeding profiles in
      postmenopausal women, the combination of 1 mg E20.5 mg NETA resulted in the
      lowest incidence of bleeding in late perimenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS The
      combinations of 1 mg E20.25 mg NETA and 1 mg E20.5 mg NETA rapidly relieve
      vasomotor symptoms and are efficacious in the majority of menopausal women,
      including those with severe hot flushes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of hormone treatment on psychosocial
      distress of women during the menopausal transition (aged 40-52 years, still
      menstruating and with minor symptoms), in a study carefully designed to reduce
      bias and placebo effect. METHODS The study was randomized, controlled by
      placebo, blinded to the subject, investigators and biostatistician, crossed-over 
      after 6 months, and evaluated by a 77-item questionnaire every month for 12
      months. The medication tested was continuous conjugated estrogens (Premarin) and 
      cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera). RESULTS Of an eligible 105
      apparently healthy women, recruited by advertisement, 83 completed the
      questionnaires for the study. Randomization was successful. While there was a
      substantial variation over time in the change of scores for all the psychosocial 
      outcomes, there was no significant difference between active and placebo
      treatment when order of treatment allocation was ignored. However, a strong and
      consistent effect of the order of treatment allocation for many of the scores was
      found; in particular, the effect of active treatment was substantially stronger
      when it was administered second. Positive effects of active treatment were found 
      for the score for the overall symptom rating test (p  0.009) and its components 
      of depression and feeling of inadequacy (p = 0.011; p = 0.001, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS The use of hormones, given as a continuous estrogen and cyclic
      progestogen formulation after a formal calibrationrun-in period, may have a
      beneficial effect on psychosocial distress experienced by women towards the end
      of their reproductive function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of a new 7-day
      transdermal sequential estradiollevonorgestrel patch (Fem7 Combi; Merck KGaA;
      Germany), versus placebo, as hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women.
      METHODS A multicentre, randomized, clinical study consisting of a 3-week
      screening phase, a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase, and 
      a 12-week open, follow-up phase. Women aged 40-65 years with an intact uterus and
      menopausal complaints were randomized to either 2 weeks of an estradiol mono
      patch (50 microg per 24 h) followed by 2 weeks of an estradiollevonorgestrel
      combination patch (50 microg10 microg per 24 h), or a placebo patch, for three
      28-day cycles. Changes in the Kupperman Index and the frequency of hot flushes
      were assessed. RESULTS The sequential use of a 7-day estradiol patch and a 7-day
      estradiollevonorgestrel patch was superior to placebo in reducing menopausal
      symptoms, and was well tolerated. At the end of the treatment phase, there was a 
      statistically significant reduction in the Kupperman Index score versus placebo
      (P0.0001), and a statistically significant difference between groups in the
      proportion of patients with a reduction in the number of hot flushes (at least
      50% versus baseline). During the open follow-up phase, there was a marked
      reduction in the Kupperman Index score and the number of hot flushes for patients
      switched from placebo to active study medication. The active medication was
      effective throughout the 1-week application period. CONCLUSIONS The new 7-day
      transdermal sequential estradiollevonorgestrel patch was well tolerated,
      providing rapid and effective relief of menopausal symptoms. The addition of
      low-dose levonorgestrel did not influence the beneficial effects of estradiol.

TI  - Quality-of-life and depressive symptoms in postmenopausal women after receiving
      hormone therapy results from the Heart and EstrogenProgestin Replacement Study 
      (HERS) trial.
PG  - 591-7
AB  - CONTEXT Postmenopausal hormone therapy is commonly used by women for disease
      prevention, but its effects on quality of life have not been well documented.
      OBJECTIVE To determine the effect on quality of life of estrogen plus progestin 
      therapy used as secondary prevention in women with coronary artery disease.
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 2763 postmenopausal women with
      documented coronary artery disease (mean age, 67 years) in the Heart and
      EstrogenProgestin Replacement Study, a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind trial conducted from January 1993 to July 1998 at outpatient and
      community settings at 20 US clinical centers. INTERVENTION Participants were
      randomly assigned to receive either 0.625 mgd of conjugated equine estrogen plus
      2.5 mgd of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 1380) or placebo (n = 1383) for 36
      months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Physical activity, measured by the Duke Activity
      Status Index; energyfatigue and mental health, measured by RAND scales; and
      depressive symptoms, measured on the Burnam screening scale, at 3 years of
      follow-up. RESULTS In all patients, scores declined significantly over 3 years
      for physical function (-3.8; P.001), mental health (-0.6; P =.05), and
      energyfatigue (-3.8; P.001), but depressive symptoms were not significantly
      changed (P =.20). The effect of hormone therapy on these measures depended on the
      presence (n = 434) or absence (n = 2325) of flushing at study entry. Women with
      flushing who were assigned to hormone therapy had improved mental health (+2.6 vs
      - 0.5; P =.04) and fewer depressive symptoms (-0.5 vs + 0.007; P =.01) over
      follow-up compared with those assigned to placebo. Women without flushing who
      were assigned to hormone therapy had greater declines in physical function (-4.2 
      vs -3.3; P =.04) and energyfatigue (-4.6 vs -3.1; P =.03) over follow-up.
      Quality-of-life scores were significantly lower among patients with older age,
      diabetes, hypertension, chest pain, or heart failure. These differences in
      quality of life among women classified by clinical characteristics were much
      greater than the effects of hormone therapy. CONCLUSION Hormone therapy has
      mixed effects on quality of life among older women. The effects of hormone
      therapy depend on the presence of menopausal symptoms; women without flushing had
      greater declines in physical measures, while women with flushing had improvements
      in emotional measures of quality of life.

      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 815-20
AB  - CONTEXT Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is an established approach
      for osteoporosis prevention, little is known about the osteoprotective effects of
      HRT in frail elderly women. OBJECTIVE To determine whether HRT increases bone
      mineral density (BMD) in frail elderly women. DESIGN AND SETTING Randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in a US university-based
      research center from September 1995 to August 2000. PARTICIPANTS Sixty-seven
      women aged 75 years or older with mild-to-moderate physical frailty.
      INTERVENTION Participants were randomly assigned to receive conjugated
      estrogens, 0.625 mgd, plus trimonthly medroxyprogesterone acetate, 5 mgd for 13
      days (n = 45), or matching placebo (n = 22), for 9 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
      The primary outcome measure was 9-month change in BMD of the lumbar spine and
      hip, measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes were
      changes in markers of bone turnover. RESULTS Based on intention-to-treat
      analyses, HRT resulted in significantly larger increases in BMD of the lumbar
      spine than placebo (mean change, 4.3% vs 0.4%; between-group difference, 3.9%;
      95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5%-4.3%) and total hip (mean change, 1.7% vs
      -0.1%; between-group difference, 1.8%; 95% CI, 1.5%-2.1%). Compared with placebo,
      HRT resulted in significant decreases in serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase
      levels (mean change, -24% vs 6%; between-group difference, -30%; 95% CI, -26% to 
      -33%) and urine N-telopeptide levels (mean change, -48% vs 4%; between-group
      difference, -52%; 95% CI, -47% to -55%). CONCLUSIONS In physically frail elderly
      women, 9 months of HRT significantly increased BMD compared with placebo in
      clinically important skeletal regions. Further studies are needed to determine
      whether these osteogenic effects of HRT in elderly women are associated with a
      reduction in osteoporotic fractures.

TI  - Efficacy of estradiol for the treatment of depressive disorders in perimenopausal
      women a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 529-34
AB  - BACKGROUND Results of previous studies suggest that estrogen improves somatic
      and mild depressive symptoms experienced by perimenopausal women. This study
      investigated the efficacy of 17beta-estradiol for the treatment of clinically
      significant depressive disorders in endocrinologically confirmed perimenopausal
      women. METHODS Perimenopausal women (aged 40-55 years, with irregular menstrual 
      periods and serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone 25 IUL),
      meeting criteria for major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, or minor
      depressive disorder, according to DSM-IV, were randomized to receive transdermal 
      patches of 17beta-estradiol (100 microgram) or placebo in a 12-week,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A 4-week washout period followed the
      12-week treatment phase. Outcome measures were the Montgomery-Asberg Depression
      Rating Scale and Blatt-Kupperman Menopausal Index scores. RESULTS Fifty women
      were enrolled in the study; 26 met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder,
      11 for dysthymic disorder, and 13 for minor depressive disorder. Remission of
      depression was observed in 17 (68%) women treated with 17beta-estradiol compared 
      with 5 (20%) in the placebo group (P =.001). Subjects responded similarly to
      estradiol treatment, regardless of DSM-IV diagnosis. Patients treated with
      estradiol sustained antidepressant benefit of treatment after the 4-week washout 
      period, although somatic complaints increased in frequency and intensity.
      Treatment was well tolerated and adverse events were rare in both groups.
      CONCLUSION Transdermal estradiol replacement is an effective treatment of
      depression for perimenopausal women.

      osteoporosis is not established. To address this we compared the effect of 1 mg
      estradiol-17 beta with a 2 mg dose, in combination with cyclical dydrogesterone, 
      in the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. We conducted a multicenter
      double-masked prospective randomized, placebo-controlled study in 595 apparently 
      healthy postmenopausal women randomized to either placebo, or continuous oral
      estradiol-17 beta 1 mg or 2 mg with sequential dydrogesterone for 2 years. The
      primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in bone mineral density 
      (BMD) in the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) of actively treated groups
      compared with placebo. Women taking either 1 mg or 2 mg estradiol-17 beta showed 
      a significant increase in BMD of the LS (mean +- SD, 5.2 +- 3.8% and 6.7 +-
      4.0% respectively, both p  0.001) whilst BMD in the placebo group decreased
      (-1.9 +- 4.0%). Increases were also observed in FN BMD in both treated groups
      (2.7 +- 4.2% and 2.5 +- 5.2% respectively, both p  0.001) in contrast to the
      placebo group (-1.8 +- 4.8%). The oldest women showed the greatest treatment
      response. One milligram estradiol-17 beta in combination with dydrogesterone is
      effective in conserving LS and proximal femur bone mass, both of which are
      clinically important sites of osteoporotic fracture, and is as effective as 2 mg 
      in preventing FN bone. The lower dose of estradiol-17 beta is a particularly
      suitable treatment for osteoporosis management in older women since it should
      minimize side-effects and improve the acceptability of HRT.

TI  - Estrogen replacement therapy and ovarian cancer mortality in a large prospective 
      study of US women.
PG  - 1460-5
AB  - CONTEXT Postmenopausal estrogen use is associated with increased risk of
      endometrial and breast cancer, 2 hormone-related cancers. The effect of
      postmenopausal estrogen use on ovarian cancer is not established. OBJECTIVES To 
      examine the association between postmenopausal estrogen use and ovarian cancer
      mortality and to determine whether the association differs according to duration 
      and recency of use. DESIGN AND SETTING The American Cancer Society's Cancer
      Prevention Study II, a prospective US cohort study with mortality follow-up from 
      1982 to 1996. PARTICIPANTS A total of 211 581 postmenopausal women who completed
      a baseline questionnaire in 1982 and had no history of cancer, hysterectomy, or
      ovarian surgery at enrollment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Ovarian cancer mortality,
      compared among never users, users at baseline, and former users as well as by
      total years of use of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). RESULTS A total of 944
      ovarian cancer deaths were recorded in 14 years of follow-up. Women who were
      using ERT at baseline had higher death rates from ovarian cancer than never users
      (rate ratio [RR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.96). Risk was
      slightly but not significantly increased among former estrogen users (RR, 1.16;
      95% CI, 0.99-1.37). Duration of use was associated with increased risk in both
      baseline and former users. Baseline users with 10 or more years of use had an RR 
      of 2.20 (95% CI, 1.53-3.17), while former users with 10 or more years of use had 
      an RR of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.13-2.25). Annual age-adjusted ovarian cancer death rates
      per 100 000 women were 64.4 for baseline users with 10 or more years of use, 38.3
      for former users with 10 or more years of use, and 26.4 for never users. Among
      former users with 10 or more years of use, risk decreased with time since last
      use reported at study entry (RR for last use 15 years ago, 2.05; 95% CI,
      1.29-3.25; RR for last use =15 years ago, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.79-2.17).
      CONCLUSIONS In this population, postmenopausal estrogen use for 10 or more years
      was associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer mortality that persisted up 
      to 29 years after cessation of use.

TI  - Postmenopausal hormones and incontinence the Heart and EstrogenProgestin
      Replacement Study.
PG  - 116-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE To determine whether postmenopausal hormone therapy improves the
      severity of urinary incontinence. METHODS We included measures of incontinence
      and voiding frequency in the Heart and EstrogenProgestin Replacement Study, a
      randomized, blinded trial of the effect of hormone therapy among 2763
      postmenopausal women younger than 80 years with coronary disease and intact
      uteri. This report includes 1525 participants who reported at least one episode
      of incontinence per week at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to
      0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in
      one tablet daily (n = 768) or placebo (n = 757) and were followed for a mean of
      4.1 years. Severity of incontinence was classified as improved (decrease of at
      least two episodes per week), unchanged (change of at most one episode per week),
      or worsened (increase of at least two episodes per week). RESULTS Incontinence
      improved in 26% of the women assigned to placebo compared with 21% assigned to
      hormones, while 27% of the placebo group worsened compared with 39% of the
      hormone group (P =.001). This difference was evident by 4 months of treatment and
      was observed for both urge and stress incontinence. The number of incontinent
      episodes per week increased an average of 0.7 in the hormone group and decreased 
      by 0.1 in the placebo group (P .001). CONCLUSION Daily oral estrogen plus
      progestin therapy was associated with worsening urinary incontinence in older
      postmenopausal women with weekly incontinence. We do not recommend this therapy
      for the treatment of incontinence.

TI  - Hormonal replacement therapy reduces forearm fracture incidence in recent
      postmenopausal women - results of the Danish Osteoporosis Prevention Study.
PG  - 181-93
AB  - OBJECTIVES To study the fracture reducing potential of hormonal replacement
      therapy (HRT) in recent postmenopausal women in a primary preventive scenario.
      METHODS Prospective controlled comprehensive cohort trial 2016 healthy women
      aged 45-58 years, from three to 24 months past last menstrual bleeding were
      recruited from a random sample of the background population. Mean age was 50.
      8+-2.8 years, and the number of person years followed was 9335.3. There were two
      main study arms a randomised arm (randomised to HRT; n=502, or not; n=504) and a
      non-randomised arm (on HRT; n=221, or not; n=789 by own choice). First line HRT
      was oral sequential oestradiolnorethisterone in women with intact uterus and
      oral continuous oestradiol in hysterectomised women. RESULTS After five years, a
      total of 156 fractures were sustained by 140 women. There were 51 forearm
      fractures in 51 women. By intention-to-treat analysis (n=2016), overall fracture 
      risk was borderline statistically significantly reduced (RR=0.73, 95% CI
      0.50-1.05), and forearm fracture risk was significantly reduced (RR=0.45, 95% CI
      0.22-0.90) with HRT. Restricting the analysis to women who had adhered to their
      initial allocation of either HRT (n=395) or no HRT (n=977) showed a significant
      reduction in both the overall fracture risk (RR=0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.97) and the 
      risk of forearm fractures (RR=0.24, 95% CI 0.09-0.69). Compliance with HRT was
      65% after five years. CONCLUSIONS It is possible to reduce the number of forearm
      fractures and possibly the total number of fractures in recent postmenopausal
      women by use of HRT as primary prevention.

PG  - 123-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE To establish whether estrogen treatment affects well-being in
      postmenopausal women without current or previous vasomotor symptoms. DESIGN
      Forty postmenopausal women, aged 45-59 years, without current or previous
      vasomotor complaints, were included. They were randomized to masked treatment
      with either transdermal 17beta-estradiol 50 microg24 h or to placebo. At
      baseline and after 12 and 14 weeks of treatment, the women completed a
      questionnaire which reflects well-being, the Psychological General Well-Being
      (PGWB) Index. RESULTS The women scored high on the PGWB Index, both at baseline 
      and after 12 and 14 weeks of treatment. There was no significant difference in
      well-being according to PGWB Index between the groups treated with estrogen and
      placebo, neither at baseline, nor after therapy. Furthermore, there was no
      difference in change during therapy between the treatment groups. CONCLUSION
      There is a gradual decline in estrogen during the climacteric, and it is
      controversial to which extent this affects women's mental health. The PGWB scores
      in this study were high before therapy, reflecting that these women without
      previous or current vasomotor complaints represented a selected sample. Neither
      short-term estrogen treatment over 12 weeks nor addition with medroxyprogesterone
      acetate during 2 weeks improved well-being in postmenopausal women without
      vasomotor symptoms who had high well-being at baseline.

PG  - 310-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of different doses of
      173-estradiol for the treatment of vasomotor and vulvovaginal symptoms. DESIGN
      This was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group study. One
      hundred forty-five subjects, including naturally postmenopausal women aged 40-60 
      (who had not experienced menses for at least 12 months), women who had undergone 
      hysterectomy, and women aged 25-60 who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy with 
      or without hysterectomy were studied. Either placebo or 17beta-estradiol (1 mg or
      0.5 mg) was given orally every day for 12 weeks, and vasomotor symptoms and
      vaginal epithelial cytology were evaluated. RESULTS There were significant
      differences between placebo and the active treatments in the percentage change
      from baseline in the number of hot flushes (all hot flushes, 1 mg vs. placebo, p 
       0.00 1; 0.5 mg vs. placebo, p = 0.007), with a more substantial proportion of
      subjects responding in the 1-mg group (mean change in mean number of hot flushes 
      of 83.2%). Both doses were also more effective than placebo in increasing the
      proportion of mature vaginal cells (end-of-treatment mean values of 0%, 78.5%,
      and 21.5% for parabasal, intermediate, and superficial cells, respectively, in
      the 1-mg group; mean values of 0.3%, 80.8%, and 18.9% in the 0.5-mg group; and
      mean values of 15.2%, 74.7%, and 10.2% in the placebo group). The proportion of
      subjects reporting no vaginal dryness was greatest in the 1-mg group (mean
      percentage of days without dryness of 86.1% at weeks 9-12). CONCLUSIONS For the 
      relief of vasomotor and vulvovaginal symptoms, 17beta-estradiol I mg is effective
      and has an excellent safety profile.

TI  - An estradiol matrix transdermal system for the prevention of postmenopausal bone 
      loss.
PG  - 845-57
AB  - OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of 2 years' application of an estradiol matrix transdermal system
      for the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. METHODS In this multicenter,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 261 surgically or naturally
      postmenopausal women were randomized to apply the estradiol matrix transdermal
      system (0.025, 0.0375, 0.05, or 0.1 mgd) or matching placebo twice a week for 2 
      years. The study was double blind with respect to treatment (active vs placebo)
      but not to the dose levels of active treatment (because of the differing sizes
      and shapes of the patches). In addition to receiving the assigned treatment, the 
      100 nonhysterectomized women received 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate daily
      throughout the study. RESULTS The evaluable group (n = 259) had a mean age of 52
      years and a mean duration of menopause of 32 months. Following 2 years of
      treatment, there were significant differences in favor of estradiol between all
      doses of the estradiol matrix transdermal system and placebo in terms of the
      percentage change from baseline in the bone mineral density (BMD) of the L1-L4
      anteroposterior lumbar spine (0.1 and 0.05 mgd, P  0.001; 0.0375 mgd, P =
      0.024; 0.025 mgd, P = 0.002). Percentage changes from baseline in the BMD of the
      femoral neck after 2 years of treatment also consistently demonstrated the
      efficacy of the estradiol matrix transdermal system compared with placebo (all, P
       or = 0.044). The estradiol matrix transdermal system was well tolerated.
      CONCLUSION The estradiol matrix transdermal system was effective in preventing
      postmenopausal bone loss at dosages of 0.025 to 0.1 mgd, and had a safety
      profile consistent with the known effects of estrogenprogestin.

TI  - 17beta-estradiol vaginal tablet versus conjugated equine estrogen vaginal cream
      to relieve menopausal atrophic vaginitis.
PG  - 156-61
AB  - OBJECTIVES The efficacy and safety of 25-microg 17beta-estradiol vaginal tablets
      (Vagifem) were assessed and compared with 1.25-mg conjugated equine estrogen
      vaginal cream (Premarin Vaginal Cream) for the relief of menopausal-derived
      atrophic vaginitis, resulting from estrogen deficiency. DESIGN In a multicenter,
      open-label, randomized, parallel-group study, 159 menopausal women were treated
      for 24 weeks with either vaginal tablets or vaginal cream. Efficacy was evaluated
      by relief of vaginal symptoms and concentrations of serum estradiol and
      follicle-stimulating hormone. Safety was monitored by the incidence of adverse
      events, evaluation of endometrial biopsies, and clinical laboratory results.
      Patients also assessed the acceptability of the study medications. RESULTS
      Composite scores of vaginal symptoms (dryness, soreness, and irritation)
      demonstrated that both treatments provided equivalent relief of the symptoms of
      atrophic vaginitis. At weeks 2, 12, and 24, increases in serum estradiol
      concentrations and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone were observed in
      significantly more patients who were using the vaginal cream than in those who
      were using the vaginal tablets (p  0.001). Fewer patients who were using the
      vaginal tablets experienced endometrial proliferation or hyperplasia compared
      with patients who were using the vaginal cream. Significantly more patients who
      were using the vaginal tablets rated their medication favorably than did patients
      who were using the vaginal cream (p  or = 0.001). Patients who were receiving
      the vaginal tablets also had a lower incidence of patient withdrawal (10% versus 
      32%). CONCLUSIONS Treatment regimens with 25-microg 17beta-estradiol vaginal
      tablets and with 1.25-mg conjugated equine estrogen vaginal cream were equivalent
      in relieving symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. The vaginal tablets demonstrated a
      localized effect without appreciable systemic estradiol increases or estrogenic
      side effects. Vaginal tablet therapy resulted in greater patient acceptance and
      lower withdrawal rates compared with vaginal cream therapy.

TI  - Initial 17beta-estradiol dose for treating vasomotor symptoms.
PG  - 726-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of different doses of 17beta-estradiol (E2)
      for relief of vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women. METHODS This was a
      randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, 12-week study in which 333
      menopausal women with moderate or severe hot flushes were assigned to treatment
      with 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg oral micronized 17beta-E2, or placebo. The
      number and severity of hot flushes were recorded daily. RESULTS There was a
      significant linear correlation between increased dosage of 17beta-E2 and
      decreased moderate to severe hot flushes per week (P .001). Rapid reduction in
      moderate to severe hot flushes was only achieved with 1 and 2 mg, showing a
      significant difference from placebo at week 4 (P .05). At week 4, half the women
      on placebo had reduced moderate to severe hot flushes of at least 52%; the
      corresponding figures were 56%, 69%, 86%, and 91% for 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg,
      respectively. At week 12, all doses except 0.25 mg were significantly better than
      placebo for reducing moderate to severe hot flushes (P .001). Although there
      were no significant differences, twice as many women in the 2-mg group
      discontinued treatment due to adverse events, compared with the placebo group.
      CONCLUSION Oral micronized 17beta-E2 showed a dose-response effect for reducing 
      moderate and severe hot flushes in menopausal women. 17beta-E2 1 mg appeared to
      be the most useful initial dose.

TI  - Efficacy on climacteric symptoms and safety of low dose estradiol transdermal
      matrix patches. A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 293-300
AB  - Two estradiol (E2) transdermal patches releasing 25 microgramsday E2 (D-25) or
      37.5 microgramsday E2 (D-37.5) were compared to a placebo patch on 156 patients 
      in natural or surgical menopause suffering from at least 5 hot flushes per day,
      randomly and blindly assigned to three parallel groups of 52 patients each, to be
      treated continuously for 12 weeks, without progestin opposition. Responders
      (patients with less than 3 hot flushes per day at the end of treatment), were 82%
      and 90% under D-25 or D-37.5, respectively, both significantly (p  0.001) more
      than under placebo (44%). Comparable efficacy was observed on severity of hot
      flushes, Kupperman Index and on the self-rated efficacy. Systemic adverse events 
      occurred in 10%, 10% and 8% of patients, respectively, under D-25, D-37.5 or
      placebo. Occasional mild and transient itching andor erythema on the site of
      application was reported by few patients and did never require discontinuation of
      application. In conclusion D-25 and D-37.5 were significantly more effective than
      placebo in relieving climacteric symptoms and were systemically and locally as
      well tolerated as placebo. D-25 (Demestril 25) releasing 25 microgramsday E2 can
      therefore be recommended for low-dosed estrogen replacement therapy.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of a new 7-day transdermal estradiol patch versus
      placebo in hysterectomized women with postmenopausal complaints.
PG  - 143-53
AB  - OBJECTIVES To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of a continuously
      applied 7-day-Estradiol patch (Fem7, Merck KGaA, Germany) delivering 50 microg
      estradiol per day in the treatment of hysterectomized women with postmenopausal
      complaints compared with placebo. DESIGN A multicentre, randomized, double-blind
      study with an initial screening phase (phase I), a 3-month double-blind
      placebo-controlled phase (phase II) and a 3-month open follow-up phase (phase
      III). METHODS 186 patients were randomized for a 3-cycle placebo-controlled
      study followed by a 3-cycle open follow-up (total duration; 6 months). The
      changes in Kupperman Index (primary efficacy variable), hot flushes and
      urogenital symptom score were studied from baseline to the end of the study. In
      addition, skin tolerability was assessed and patients were also asked to grade
      the subjective acceptance of therapy. RESULTS A reduction in Kupperman Index was
      observed in both groups, and at each cycle of the placebo-controlled treatment
      phase the 7-day-Estradiol patch was superior compared with placebo (last value
      vs. baseline P = 0.0006). From the second treatment week onwards a distinct
      difference was noted in the reduction of hot flushes from baseline between the
      7-day-Estradiol patch group and the placebo group. The difference between the
      groups was statistically significant for each cycle and at the end of the
      controlled treatment phase (mean weekly hot flush reduction at the end of the
      placebo-controlled treatment phase -32.5 for the 7-day-Estradiol patch vs. -22.0
      for placebo, P = 0.0025). The efficacy of the 7-day-Estradiol patch within the
      application period did not show any difference between days 1-3 and 4-7.
      Subjective acceptance of the 7-day-Estradiol patch was good and 72.4% of patients
      who took active medication throughout the study were willing to consider
      continuing its use. CONCLUSIONS The 7-day-Estradiol patch is well tolerated and 
      provides effective relief of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in
      hysterectomized women, with a rapid onset of action and 7-day duration of
      therapeutic effect. Although a placebo effect was observed, the 7-day-Estradiol
      patch significantly reduced hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms throughout 
      the application period.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized, comparative study evaluating clinical effects of two 
      sequential estradiol-progestogen combinations containing either desogestrel or
      medroxyprogesterone acetate in climacteric women.
PG  - 133-42
AB  - OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare a new sequential
      estradiol-desogestrel (E2-DSG) hormone replacement regimen (Liseta) with one of
      the standard treatments i.e. estradiol valerate-medroxyprogesterone acetate
      (E2V-MPA) combination (Klimalet) regarding the alleviation of climacteric
      symptoms, vaginal bleeding pattern and the occurrence of adverse experiences.
      METHODS In a multicenter study performed in Denmark, a total of 376
      perimenopausal women with climacteric symptoms were randomly allocated to oral
      sequential treatment with either E2-DSG (1.5 mg E2 for 24 days with 0.15 mg DSG
      for the last 12 days followed by a placebo tablet for 4 days) (n = 186) or with
      E2V-MPA (2 mg E2V for 21 days with 10 mg MPA for the last 10 days) (n = 190).
      Treatments were administered, using a double-blind, double-dummy technique for 6 
      cycles of 28 days. RESULTS Three hundred and seventeen women, 158 in the E2-DSG 
      and 159 in the E2V-MPA group, completed six treatment cycles. Both treatments
      reduced menopausal symptoms rapidly and to a similar extent. Hot flushes were
      present in 88% of the women in both groups. After six treatment cycles, hot
      flushes were no longer present in 71 and 62% of the women in the E2-DSG and
      E2V-MPA group, respectively. Perspiration decreased from 80 to 65% in the E2-DSG 
      group and from 82 to 63% in the E2V-MPA group. Mood disturbances were present in 
      82% of the women in the E2-DSG at baseline, and in 52% after six cycles. In the
      E2V-MPA group the corresponding figures were 68 and 42%, respectively. The
      bleeding pattern was comparable in both treatment groups. Regular withdrawal
      (expected) bleeding appeared in 90-92% and in 85-90% of the women in cycles 1-5
      with E2-DSG and E2V-MPA, respectively. Irregular bleeding (including spotting)
      occurred in 15.2% of the women receiving E2-DSG and in 20.1% of the women treated
      with E2V-MPA in cycle 6. In both treatment groups there was a tendency of a
      slight decrease in blood pressure. Adverse events were in less than 10% in each
      group the reason to discontinue treatment. CONCLUSIONS Both treatments
      effectively alleviated menopausal complaints and presented good cycle control.
      Bleeding pattern and mood disturbances appeared to be more favorable influenced
      by E2-DSG.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To examine the efficacy and tolerability of a new matrix patch
      delivering estradiol (E2 Matrix) at doses of 0.05 and 0.10 mg per day (Estraderm 
      MX 50, 100) in the treatment of moderate to severe postmenopausal symptoms.
      METHODS A total of 254 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive treatment
      with E2 Matrix 0.10 mg (N = 86), E2 Matrix 0.05 mg (N = 82), or placebo (N = 86) 
      in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion for a period of 12 weeks continuously.
      Patches were applied twice weekly to the buttocks with each patient wearing two
      patches at all times. The primary efficacy criterion was the difference from
      baseline of the mean number of moderate to severe hot flushes per 24 h during the
      last 2 weeks of treatment. Other efficacy variables included reduction in hot
      flushes at 4 and 8 weeks, reduction in daytime flushing and night sweats, and
      Kupperman Index at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS E2 Matrix 0.10 and 0.05 mg were
      both significantly superior to placebo in reducing hot flushes per 24 h after 4, 
      8, and 12 weeks of treatment (P  0.001). Also, for all other efficacy parameters
      studied, both dosage strengths of E2 Matrix were statistically significantly
      superior to placebo at all time points (P  0.001). Local tolerability was good
      in both groups. A slight increase in estrogen related adverse effects (breast
      tenderness, leukorrhoea) was seen with the 0.10 mg patch. Adhesion of patches and
      compliance were good. Overall systemic tolerability was good in both treated
      groups. However, a 4.8% overall incidence of endometrial hyperplasia was observed
      in patients with an intact uterus. CONCLUSIONS This new matrix patch offers an
      effective and well tolerated dosage form for delivery of 0.05 and 0.1 mg
      estradiol per day. It may be particularly suitable for those women who experience
      local sensitivity to alcohol-containing systems. In light of the observed
      hyperplasia after treatment in five patients, estrogen therapy should as yet be
      supplemented monthly with a progestogen in women with an intact uterus.

TI  - Matrix delivery transdermal 17beta-estradiol for the prevention of bone loss in
      postmenopausal women. The International Study Group.
PG  - 358-66
AB  - A total of 277 early postmenopausal women were enrolled in this
      placebo-controlled 2-year study to examine the efficacy of a matrix transdermal
      17beta-estradiol system, at three different dosages (25, 50 and 75 mgday)
      combined with sequential oral dydrogesterone 20 mgday, in preventing bone loss. 
      At 2 years, the difference from placebo in percentage change from baseline of
      L1-4 lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) (assessed by dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry) was 4.7% +- 0.7% with estradiol 25 mgday, 7.3% +- 0.7% with
      estradiol 50 mgday and 8.7% +- 0.7% with estradiol 75 mgday (all values mean
      +- SEM). There were also significant increases in femoral neck, trochanter and
      total hip BMD with all doses of estradiol compared with placebo. Additionally,
      most patients had a significant gain (increase greater than 2.08%) in lumbar
      spine bone mass compared with placebo. Patients who received estradiol also
      experienced clinically significant and dose-related decreases in total serum
      osteocalcin, serum bone alkaline phosphatase and urinary C-telopeptide, with all 
      three markers of bone turnover returning to premenopausal levels. Estradiol was
      well tolerated during the 2-year treatment period. Transdermal estradiol is
      effective and well tolerated at dosages between 25-75 mgday in the prevention of
      bone loss in postmenopausal women; 25 mgday offers an effective option for those
      women who cannot tolerate higher doses.

TI  - Monofluorophosphate combined with hormone replacement therapy induces a
      synergistic effect on bone mass by dissociating bone formation and resorption in 
      postmenopausal women a randomized study.
PG  - 3013-20
AB  - Sodium fluoride stimulates bone formation and has been used to treat osteoporosis
      for decades despite debate about the antifracture efficacy. Hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) results in only modest increases in bone mineral density (BMD).
      However, for women with low bone mass, the ideal therapy should not only inhibit 
      bone resorption but simultaneously stimulate bone formation to increase bone mass
      above the fracture threshold. We thus performed a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled intervention study to prospectively investigate the effect of 
      a low dose of fluoride, in combination with HRT, on BMD and biochemical markers
      of bone turnover. One hundred healthy postmenopausal women (60-70 yr old) were
      thus randomly assigned to 1) HRT [transdermal 17beta-estradiol, releasing 50
      microgday; plus oral norethisterone acetate (NETA), 1 mgday]; or 2) oral
      monofluorophosphate (MFP; equivalent to fluoride, 20 mgday); or 3) HRT+MFP; or
      4) placebo, for 96 weeks. All participants received a calcium supplement of 1000 
      mgday. Sixty-eight women completed the study. We found a pronounced, linear
      increase in spinal BMD during treatment with HRT+MFP [11.8% (1.7% SEM)], which
      was significantly greater than the increase in the HRT group [4.0% (0.5% per yr);
      P  0.05]. MFP produced a smaller increase [2.4% (0.6% per yr)], whereas there
      was no change in the placebo group [0.0% (0.5% SEM)]. Similar changes were found 
      at the other skeletal sites (distal forearm, hip, and total body). Markers of
      bone formation showed a fall in the HRT group, which was significantly more
      pronounced than in the combined HRT+MFP group. A nonsignificant increase was
      found in the MFP group, whereas the placebo group showed a decrease caused by
      calcium treatment. The marker of bone resorption decreased significantly more in 
      the HRT and the HRT+MFP groups than in the placebo group but tended to increase
      in the MFP group. In conclusion, this study shows, by use of biochemical markers 
      of bone turnover, that bone resorption and formation may be dissociated, as a
      result of actions of two compounds with diverging effects on bone turnover.
      Furthermore, the synergistic effects of relatively low doses of the compounds
      suggested statistically and clinically significant increases in trabecular and
      probably also cortical bone. Adverse effects were relatively rare and mild.

TI  - The effect of low-dose continuous estrogen and progesterone therapy with calcium 
      and vitamin D on bone in elderly women. A randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 897-904
AB  - BACKGROUND Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the mainstay of osteoporosis
      prevention, is limited because of dose-related risks, side effects, and patient
      acceptance. The bone-sparing efficacy and tolerability of the lowest available
      doses of HRT have not been adequately studied in elderly women. OBJECTIVE To
      determine the bone-sparing effect of continuous low-dose HRT in elderly women.
      DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING University
      osteoporosis research and clinical center. PATIENTS 128 healthy white women (age
       65 years) with low bone mass recruited by word of mouth and by local
      advertisement. The principal eligibility criterion was spinal bone mineral
      density of 0.90 gcm2 or less. INTERVENTION Continuous therapy with conjugated
      equine estrogen, 0.3 mgd, and medroxyprogesterone, 2.5 mgd, or matching
      placebo. Sufficient calcium supplementation was given to bring all calcium
      intakes above 1000 mgd in both groups; supplemental oral 25-hydroxyvitamin D was
      given to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of at least 75 nmolL in both 
      groups. MEASUREMENTS Bone mineral density of the spine, hip, total body, and
      forearm; serum total alkaline phosphatase and serum osteocalcin levels at 6-month
      intervals; and 24-hour urine creatinine and hydroxyproline excretion at baseline,
      12 months, and 42 months. RESULTS During 3.5 years of observation, spinal bone
      mineral density increased by 3.5% (P  0.001) in an intention-to-treat analysis
      and by 5.2% among patients with greater than 90% adherence to therapy.
      Significant increases were seen in total-body and forearm bone density (P 
      0.01). Symptoms related to HRT (breast tenderness, spotting, pelvic discomfort,
      and mood changes) were mild and short-lived. CONCLUSIONS Continuous low-dose HRT
      with conjugated equine estrogen and oral medroxyprogesterone combined with
      adequate calcium and vitamin D provides a bone-sparing effect that is similar or 
      superior to that provided by other, higher-dose HRT regimens in elderly women.
      This combination is well tolerated by most patients.

      Postmenopausal EstrogenProgestin Interventions Trial.
PG  - 982-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE To assess pair-wise differences between placebo, estrogen, and each of
      three estrogen-progestin regimens on selected symptoms. METHODS This was a
      3-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 875 postmenopausal
      women aged 45-64 years at baseline. Participants were assigned randomly to one of
      five groups 1) placebo, 2) daily conjugated equine estrogens, 3) conjugated
      equine estrogens plus cyclical medroxyprogesterone acetate, 4) conjugated equine 
      estrogens plus daily medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 5) conjugated equine
      estrogens plus cyclical micronized progesterone. Symptoms were self-reported
      using a checklist at 1 and 3 years. Factor analysis reduced 52 symptoms to a set 
      of six symptom groups. RESULTS In intention-to-treat analyses at 1 year, each
      active treatment demonstrated a marked, statistically significant, protective
      effect against vasomotor symptoms compared with placebo (odds ratios [ORs]
      0.17-0.28); there was no additional benefit of estrogen-progestin over estrogen
      alone. Only progestin-containing regimens were significantly associated with
      higher levels of breast discomfort (OR 1.92-2.27). Compared with placebo, women
      randomized to conjugated equine estrogens reported no increase in perceived
      weight. Those randomized to medroxyprogesterone acetate reported less perceived
      weight gain (OR 0.61-0.69) than placebo. Anxiety, cognitive, and affective
      symptoms did not differ by treatment assignment. Analyses restricted to adherent 
      women were not materially different than those using intention-to-treat, except
      that women adherent to medroxyprogesterone acetate and micronized progesterone
      regimens reported fewer musculoskeletal symptoms (OR 0.62-0.68). CONCLUSION
      These results confirm the usefulness of post-menopausal hormone therapy for hot
      flashes, show convincingly that estrogen plus progestin causes breast discomfort,
      and demonstrate little influence of postmenopausal hormones on anxiety,
      cognition, or affect.

      Study (HERS) Research Group.
PG  - 605-13
AB  - CONTEXT Observational studies have found lower rates of coronary heart disease
      (CHD) in postmenopausal women who take estrogen than in women who do not, but
      this potential benefit has not been confirmed in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE To
      determine if estrogen plus progestin therapy alters the risk for CHD events in
      postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. DESIGN Randomized,
      blinded, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial. SETTING Outpatient and
      community settings at 20 US clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS A total of 2763 women
      with coronary disease, younger than 80 years, and postmenopausal with an intact
      uterus. Mean age was 66.7 years. INTERVENTION Either 0.625 mg of conjugated
      equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n 
      = 1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1
      years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 
      year, and 75% at the end of 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome
      was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary
      cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina,
      congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient
      ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also
      considered. RESULTS Overall, there were no significant differences between
      groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes
      172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD
      death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The 
      lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P.001). Within 
      the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with
      more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and
      fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group
      experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) 
      and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no
      significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, 
      including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95%
      CI, 0.84-1.38). CONCLUSIONS During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment 
      with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not
      reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established
      coronary disease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events
      and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular
      benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not
      recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD.
      However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of
      therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to
      continue.

AB  - We have assessed urinary deoxypyridinoline (Dpd) levels by immunoassay in women
      who participated in a double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of the bone loss
      prevention effects of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). Ninety-one women who
      had undergone recent surgical menopause were randomized to receive either placebo
      or 0.025, 0.05 or 0.1 mgday transdermal 17 beta-estradiol for 2 years. Mean Dpd 
      levels in the postmenopausal women were significantly elevated (p  0.0001) above
      mean Dpd levels in a reference population of healthy, premenopausal women.
      Subjects in the placebo group lost 6.4% of lumbar spine bone mineral density
      (BMD) and 4.9% of mid-radius bone mineral content (BMC) over 2 years. Dpd levels 
      at baseline were inversely correlated with BMD and BMC changes in the placebo
      group. The placebo group and subjects receiving 0.025 mgday 17 beta-estradiol
      who had Dpd levels increased above the reference interval cut-off (mean + 2
      standard deviations, 7.5 nmolmmol) lost 2 times more bone mass than did those
      with Dpd levels below it. Dpd levels decreased significantly (p  0.01) from
      baseline at 6 months following initiation of treatment with 0.05 or 0.1 mgday 17
      beta-estradiol, changes that correlated with increased lumbar spine BMD and with 
      changes in mid-radius BMC. At 12 months, Dpd levels were lower than baseline and 
      placebo in all three treatment groups. These data suggest utility of this Dpd
      immunoassay in assessing changes in bone resorption induced by surgical menopause
      and ERT.

TI  - A four-year randomized controlled trial of hormone replacement and
      bisphosphonate, alone or in combination, in women with postmenopausal
      osteoporosis.
PG  - 219-26
AB  - PURPOSE Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen and treatment with
      bisphosphonates have been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in
      postmenopausal women. This 4-year prospective randomized study was carried out to
      assess the effectiveness of the combined HRT plus etidronate on BMD in
      postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS
      Seventy-two postmenopausal women (mean age 64.9+-0.5 years) attending metabolic 
      bone disease outpatient clinics with established osteoporosis were randomly
      allocated into one of four treatment groups and monitored for 4 years. All
      patients enrolled in this study including the control group (n=18) received 1.0 g
      elemental calcium and 400 units vitamin D per day. The HRT group (n=18) received 
      cyclical estrogen and progesterone; the etidronate group (n=17) received
      intermittent cyclical etidronate; and the combined therapy group (n=19) received 
      both HRT and etidronate. BMD was measured in the lumbar spine and the hip before 
      treatment and at 2 and 4 years after treatment. Changes in height were recorded, 
      and the occurrence of new vertebral fractures were documented in comparison with 
      the baseline radiographic evaluation. In 40 patients (10 patients per group),
      analysis of bone histomorphometry was carried out after 4 years of treatment.
      RESULTS In patients who received the combined therapy, BMD increased in the
      lumbar spine by 10.4% (P 0.001) and in the hip by 7.0% (P 0.001) at 4 years.
      For patients treated with ICE, these increases were 7.3% (P 0.001) and 0.9% (P
      0.05), and with HRT, the increases were 7.0% (P 0.001) and 4.8% (P 0.01) in
      the vertebrae and femora, respectively. The group treated with calcium and
      vitamin D lost 2.5% (P 0.05) and 4.4% (P 0.01) of BMD in the vertebrae and
      femora, respectively, after 4 years. Patients who received combined therapy had
      significantly higher BMD in both the vertebrae and in the femora (P 0.05) in
      comparison with patients who were treated with HRT or etidronate alone after 4
      years. In comparison with patients in the control group, there was a trend toward
      a lower rate of new vertebral fractures in the treatment groups. Height loss was 
      significantly less in all three active treatment groups (HRT [P 0.001],
      etidronate [P 0.02], and combined therapy group [P 0.0001]), in comparison with
      the control group. The combined therapy group did not have a significant height
      loss, in comparison with the HRT (P 0.02) and the etidronate (P 0.001) groups. 
      None of the patients had histomorphometric evidence of osteomalacia. CONCLUSION 
      This 4-year randomized study showed an additive effect of etidronate and HRT on
      hip and spine BMD in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis.

PG  - 2609-15
AB  - BACKGROUND Prospective studies have shown that doses equivalent to conjugated
      equine estrogens of 0.625 mgd or higher are needed to produce a significant
      increase in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine. OBJECTIVES To determine
      the effects of unopposed esterified estrogens on bone mineral density, lipid
      levels, and endometrial tissue structure, and to relate these effects to changes 
      in plasma estradiol levels. METHODS Four hundred six postmenopausal women were
      given calcium, 1000 mgd, and randomly assigned to receive continuous esterified 
      estrogens (0.3, 0.625, or 1.25 mgd) or placebo for 24 months. Bone mineral
      density measurements and endometrial and laboratory assessments were conducted
      every 6 months; plasma estradiol concentrations were measured after 12, 18, and
      24 months. RESULTS All doses of esterified estrogens produced significant
      increases in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine compared with baseline and 
      with placebo at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Mean plasma estradiol levels increased 
      with esterified estrogens dose, and individual subject bone mineral density
      changes appeared related to plasma estradiol concentrations. Clinically relevant 
      rates of endometrial hyperplasia were noted only in the groups receiving 0.625
      and 1.25 mg of esterified estrogens daily. Lipid changes were dose related and
      apparent in all groups. CONCLUSIONS Esterified estrogens at doses from 0.3 to
      1.25 mgd, administered unopposed by progestin, produce a continuum of positive
      changes on bone and lipids. Plasma estradiol concentrations increased with
      esterified estrogens dose and were related to positive bone mineral densities.
      The 0.3-mg dose resulted in positive bone and lipid changes without inducing
      endometrial hyperplasia.

TI  - Prevention of bone loss with alendronate in postmenopausal women under 60 years
      of age. Early Postmenopausal Intervention Cohort Study Group.
PG  - 485-92
AB  - BACKGROUND Estrogen-replacement therapy prevents osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
      women by inhibiting bone resorption, but the balance between its long-term risks 
      and benefits remains unclear. Whether other antiresorptive therapies can prevent 
      osteoporosis in these women is also not clear. METHODS We studied the effect of 
      2.5 mg or 5 mg of alendronate per day or placebo on bone mineral density in 1174 
      postmenopausal women under 60 years of age. An additional 435 women who were
      prepared to receive a combination of estrogen and progestin were randomly
      assigned to one of the above treatments or open-label estrogen-progestin. The
      main outcome measure was the change in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, 
      hip, distal forearm, and total body measured annually for two years by
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS The women who received placebo lost
      bone mineral density at all measured sites, whereas the women treated with 5 mg
      of alendronate daily had a mean (+-SE) increase in bone mineral density of
      3.5+-0.2 percent at the lumbar spine, 1.9+-0.1 percent at the hip, and
      0.7+-0.1 percent for the total body (all P0.001). Women treated with 2.5 mg of 
      alendronate daily had smaller increases in bone mineral density. Alendronate did 
      not increase bone mineral density of the forearm, but it slowed the loss. The
      responses to estrogen-progestin were 1 to 2 percentage points greater than those 
      to the 5-mg dose of alendronate. Alendronate was well tolerated, with a safety
      profile similar to that of placebo or estrogen-progestin. CONCLUSIONS
      Alendronate prevents bone loss in postmenopausal women under 60 years of age to
      nearly the same extent as estrogen-progestin.

TI  - Effects of combined low dose of the isoflavone derivative ipriflavone and
      estrogen replacement on bone mineral density and metabolism in postmenopausal
      women.
PG  - 75-81
AB  - OBJECTIVES To assess the pattern of biochemical markers of bone metabolism and
      vertebral bone mineral density in early postmenopausal women treated with
      combined ipriflavone and low dose conjugated estrogens. METHODS Bone biochemical
      markers and vertebral bone density were evaluated in a longitudinal, comparative,
      2 year study conducted in postmenopausal women treated with sole calcium
      supplementation (500 mgday), or with either ipriflavone (IP) at the standard
      dose (600 mgday) plus the same calcium dose, low dose conjugated estrogens (CE) 
      (0.3 mgday) plus calcium, or low dose IP (400 mgday) plus low dose CE (0.3
      mgday) plus calcium. The results were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of 
      variance, as appropriate. RESULTS No modifications of both urinary excretion of 
      hydroxyproline and plasma osteocalcin levels were observed in calcium and in
      CE-treated women, while vertebral bone density significantly decreased (P 
      0.0001) in both groups. In IP or IP + CE-treated women, plasma osteocalcin did
      not show any modification, while urinary hydroxyproline showed a significant (P 
      0.05) decrease, that paralleled a significant (P  0.05) increase in vertebral
      bone density. CONCLUSION Postmenopausal IP administration, at the standard dose 
      of 600 mgday, can prevent the increase in bone turnover and the decrease in bone
      density that follow ovarian failure. The same effect can be obtained with the
      combined administration of low dose (400 mgday) IP with low dose (0.3 mgday)
      CE.

      hot flushes (including night sweats) per 24 h during the last 2 weeks of
      treatment. Other variables included Kupperman Index, local and systemic
      tolerability. Plasma concentrations of estradiol (E2), estrone (E1) and estrone
      sulfate (E1S) were determined before and after treatment. RESULTS Estraderm MX
      was significantly superior to placebo (P  0.001) in reducing mean number of
      moderate to severe hot flushes (including night sweats) per 24 h after 4, 8 and
      12 weeks of treatment. The estimate of treatment group differences after 12 weeks
      was 4.2 hot flushes (95% confidence interval 2.6-5.8). Estraderm MX also
      significantly reduced Kupperman Index at all time points compared to placebo (P 
      0.001). Estraderm MX induced increases in mean E2, E1 and E1S plasma levels as
      expected (E2 baseline 2.7 pgml, 12 weeks 38.9 pgml; E1 baseline 18.8 pgml,
      12 weeks 41.6 pgml; E1S baseline 235.6 pgml, 12 weeks 765.1 pgml). Overall
      rates of adverse experiences were similar for Estraderm MX and placebo. The
      number of patients reporting skin irritation was low and similar in both groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS Estraderm MX 50, a new matrix patch, offers an effective and well
      tolerated dosage form for transdermal delivery of 0.05 mg E2 per day.

TI  - The predictive value of biochemical markers of bone turnover for bone mineral
      density in early postmenopausal women treated with hormone replacement or calcium
      supplementation.
PG  - 1904-10
AB  - To compare the relative sensitivity and specificity of bone turnover indexes for 
      bone loss or gain in early postmenopausal women, we performed a multicenter trial
      in 236 menopausal women (mean age, 51 yr), who were randomized to hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT) or calcium supplementation (CS; 500 mgday) for 1 yr.
      Two markers of bone formation, osteocalcin (OC) and bone alkaline phosphatase
      (BSAP), and two markers of bone resorption, urinary N-telopeptide (NTx) and
      urinary free deoxypyridinoline (fDpd), as well as spine and femoral neck bone
      mineral density (BMD) were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after
      treatment. Women receiving HRT (n = 105) showed a significant increase in spine
      BMD (+2.5%; P  0.0001) and hip BMD (+1.0%; P = 0.02) compared to women receiving
      CS, who showed a decline at both sites (-1.1%; P  0.01). All four markers showed
      time-dependent decreases in women receiving HRT (P  0.001) and no change in
      women receiving CS alone. When baseline indexes of turnover were stratified by
      quartile, there was a significantly greater increase in BMD among those with the 
      highest NTx, OC, and BSAP levels compared to that in those with the lowest NTx,
      OC, and BSAP levels (P  0.05). The highest quartile for percent change from
      baseline to 6 months in fDpd, BSAP, and NTx was also associated with the greatest
      change in spine BMD at 1 yr. Receiver operator characteristic curves for percent 
      change from baseline to 6 months in an individual marker to 1 yr change in BMD
      during HRT revealed that the percent change in NTx provided the greatest
      discrimination between gain and loss of BMD. When subjects receiving HRT were
      compared by their positive or negative skeletal response at 1 yr and their
      baseline turnover marker, initial NTx values were significantly higher in those
      that gained bone than in those that lost bone (P = 0.0002). CS women in the
      highest quartile for NTx at baseline had significantly greater decreases in spine
      BMD than subjects with the lowest NTx values (P  0.005), although this was not
      true for fDpd (P  0.20). In conclusion, for early postmenopausal women there are
      differential responses of biochemical markers to HRT and CS. Baseline urinary NTx
      and serum OC were the most sensitive predictors of change in spine BMD after 1 yr
      of either HRT or CS. Similarly, the percent change in NTx and OC from baseline to
      6 months best predicted bone gain or loss. We conclude that markers of bone
      formation and resorption can be used clinically to predict future BMD in early
      postmenopausal women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To re-examine the minimal effective dose of conjugated estrogen
      (CEE)-progestin hormone replacement on postmenopausal bone loss. DESIGN A
      2-year, prospective, open label, randomized study. SETTING Department of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology of a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS Fifty-two
      postmenopausal or oophorectomized women. INTERVENTION One of the following
      regimens was continuously administered for 2 years (1) CEE 0.625 mgday, (2) CEE
      0.625 mg + medroxyprogesterone (MPA) 2.5 mgday, (3) CEE 0.31 mg + MPA 2.5 mgday
      and (4) control. MEASUREMENTS Lumbar spine and femoral BMD by dual energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA), a monthly based incidence of bleeding, serum lipids, PTH,
      calcitonin. A1-p, and osteocalcin. RESULTS Of the 52 patients enrolled in this
      study, 49 patients completed the 1 year of therapy and 36 completed the 2- year
      study. The control group showed a significant decrease in lumbar BMD over the 2
      years (P  0.05). The % changes in lumbar BMD at 2 years of CEE alone, CEE 0.625 
      + MPA and CEE 0.31 + MPA were 8.52% (95% confidence intervals; 4.61 approximately
      12.4%), 7.4% (0.60 approximately 14.2%) and 3.20% (0.61 approximately 5.84%),
      respectively, and were significantly higher than pretreatment values. The
      incidence of bleeding was significantly lower in women taking CEE 0.31 mg + MPA. 
      HDL cholesterol increased in women taking CEE 0.625 mg alone or with MPA. No
      significant changes in lipid profiles were seen in the control or in the group of
      women taking CEE 0.31 mg + MPA. CONCLUSIONS Continuous hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) using 0.31 mg of CEE and 2.5 mg of MPA is effective in increasing
      lumbar BMD in postmenopausal or oophorectomized women and can be an appropriate
      option for women with a normal lipid profile or those women wishing to eliminate 
      unscheduled bleeding.

      A placebo controlled 2-year prospective trial on two estrogen-progestin regimens 
      in healthy postmenopausal women.
PG  - 139-49
AB  - OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of 1- or 3-monthly sequential combinations of 
      estradiol valerate (E2V) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on menopausal
      symptoms, bone density, muscle strength and lipid metabolism in postmenopausal
      women. METHODS Changes in bone mineral density (BMD), isometric muscle strength,
      serum lipids and climacteric symptoms were evaluated in 78 women, 49-55 years of 
      age, with a spontaneous menopause 0.5-3 years earlier. Treatment group I received
      2 mg E2V tablets for 11 days, followed by 2 mg E2V + 10 mg MPA for 10 days and
      placebo for an additional 7 days; treatment group II received 2 mg E2V for 70
      days, 2 mg E2V + 20 mg MPA for 14 days, and placebo for 7 days. The placebo group
      received placebo continuously for 24 months. Each group was further randomised to
      exercise and non-exercise subgroups. RESULTS Both hormone regimens significantly
      reduced menopausal symptoms, and prevented equally well the decrease of BMD both 
      in the lumbar spine and proximal femur. A positive effect of exercise on BMD was 
      observed in the placebo group. No synergistic effect of exercise and estrogen on 
      BMD could be shown. Both hormone regimens increased the isometric strength of
      back extensor muscles. Serum total and LDL cholesterol decreased during the first
      year with both estrogen regimens. CONCLUSIONS Estrogen-progestin regimens were
      equally effective in the control of menopausal symptoms and preventing bone loss,
      increasing muscle strength and lowering serum cholesterol.

TI  - Cytokines and T-lymphocyte subsets in healthy post-menopausal women estrogen
      retards bone loss without affecting the release of IL-1 or IL-1ra.
PG  - 251-8
AB  - Interleukin (IL)-1 is a potent inducer of bone resorption, and an increased
      secretion of the IL-1 agonists IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta relative to the IL-1
      receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) has been proposed as a mechanism leading to
      post-menopausal osteoporosis. T-lymphocytes are capable of secreting bone
      resorptive cytokines and have also been linked with bone metabolism and the
      development of osteoporosis. Cytokine secretion from whole blood cell cultures
      was compared between two randomized groups of healthy early post-menopausal women
      (mean age 52.5 yrs, N = 91) and lymphocyte subsets were quantitated by flow
      cytometry. One group received cyclic estrogen-gestagen replacement therapy (ERT) 
      while the other group was untreated. In spite of a significant bone maintaining
      effect of ERT, the basal and LPS-stimulated secretion of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta,
      and IL-1ra was identical in the two groups. There was no association between
      cytokine release and bone mass or loss assessed over 2 yrs. The only exception
      was a weak estrogen-independent correlation between basal IL-1ra secretion and
      bone loss (r = -0.21, p  0.05). Flow cytometry did not confirm a relationship
      between CD4CD8 T-cell ratios and bone density or loss, and there was no effect
      of ERT on lymphocyte subsets. The number of CD3+ CD56+ T-cells showed a highly
      significant negative correlation with femoral and lumbar bone density in
      untreated women (r = -0.42, p  0.01) similar to that found in patients with
      established osteoporosis, indicating that these adherent mononuclear cells may be
      important in the pathophysiology of post-menopausal bone loss. The possibility
      that IL-1ra acts as an independent bone-sparing factor unrelated to estrogen
      withdrawal warrants further investigation. In conclusion, ERT maintains bone
      without affecting the release of the IL-1 family of cytokines in whole blood
      cultures.

TI  - Vitamin D and HRT no benefit additional to that of HRT alone in prevention of
      bone loss in early postmenopausal women. A 2.5-year randomized placebo-controlled
      study.
PG  - 126-32
AB  - The study was designed to examine the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
      and low-dose bone loss in non-osteoporotic early postmenopausal women and to
      determine whether Vit D supplementation can give additional benefit to an already
      optimized estrogen regimen. The effects of HRT and Vit D on bone mineral density 
      (BMD) were studied in postmenopausal women in a 2.5-year randomized
      placebo-controlled study. The study population was a subgroup of the Kuopio
      Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention Study (OSTPRE) (n = 13100). A total of
      464 early postmenopausal women were randomized to four groups (1) HRT (a
      sequential combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg cyproterone acetate
      (E2ValCPA); (2) vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 300 IUday); (3) HRT + Vit D; and
      (4) placebo (calcium lactate; 93 mg Ca2+day). Lumbar (L1-4) and femoral neck BMD
      were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after 2.5 years of
      treatment. After 2.5 years, lumbar BMD had increased by 1.8% in the HRT group (p 
       0.001) and by 1.4% in the HRT + Vit D group (p = 0.002), whereas lumbar BMD had
      decreased by 3.5% (p  0.001) in the Vit D group and by 3.7% (p  0.001) in the
      placebo group. The loss of femoral neck BMD was lower in the HRT (-0.3%) and the 
      HRT + Vit D (0.9%) groups compared with the Vit D (-2.4%) and the placebo groups 
      (-3.7%). This study confirms the beneficial effect of HRT on BMD. It also shows
      that low-dose vitamin D supplementation has only a minor effect in the prevention
      of osteoporosis in non-osteoporotic early postmenopausal women and does not give 
      any benefit additional to that of HRT alone.

      microg of EE2; 0.5 mg of NA and 2.5 microg of EE2; 1 mg of NA and 5 microg of
      EE2; 1 mg of NA and 10 microg of EE2; 1 microg of EE2; 2.5 microg of EE2; 5
      microg of EE2; or 10 microg of EE2. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES Bone mineral
      density (BMD) measured by quantitative computed tomography, serum lipids, and
      endometrial effects as assessed by rate of hyperplasia and proliferative status. 
      RESULTS Twelve hundred sixty-five patients entered the study. Bone mineral
      density increased significantly from baseline (P.001) in the 1 mg NA-5 microg
      EE2 and the 1 mg NA-10 microg EE2 treatment groups at each annual assessment.
      Among the unopposed EE2 groups, only the 10-microg group had increased BMD above 
      baseline, but also was accompanied by an unacceptably high rate of endometrial
      hyperplasia. The NA-EE2 treatment groups had a significant linear dose-response
      trend for increasing BMD. Increased endometrial proliferation and hyperplasia
      occurred with increasing unopposed estrogen doses. The combination of NA and EE2 
      effectively protected the endometrium against hyperplasia. The percentage of
      change in the ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol was positive for all treatment groups. The increase in
      triglyceride levels associated with EE2 was attenuated with NA-EE2 treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS Daily treatment with NA-EE2 was well tolerated and protected the
      endometrium from EE2-induced proliferation and hyperplasia. The NA-EE2 treatments
      produced a dose-related significant increase in BMD that was not present with
      unopposed EE2 treatment. The overall effect of NA-EE2 treatments on lipid
      measures was favorable.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of hormone therapy on bone mineral density (BMD)
      in the spine and hip of postmenopausal women. DESIGN A 3-year, multicenter,
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS A
      total of 875 healthy women aged 45 to 64 years recruited at 7 clinical centers.
      INTERVENTIONS Treatments were (1) placebo; (2) conjugated equine estrogens
      (CEE), 0.625 mgd; (3) CEE, 0.625 mgd plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 10
      mgd for 12 dmo; (4) CEE, 0.625 mgd plus MPA, 2.5 mgd daily; or (5) CEE, 0.625
      mgd plus micronized progesterone (MP), 200 mgd for 12 dmo. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES Bone mineral density at baseline, 12 months, and 36 months. RESULTS
      Participants assigned to the placebo group lost an average of 1.8% of spine BMD
      and 1.7% of hip BMD by the 36-month visit, while those assigned to active
      regimens gained BMD at both sites, ranging from 3.5% to 5.0% mean total increases
      in spinal BMD and a mean total increase of 1.7% of BMD in the hip. Changes in BMD
      for women assigned to active regimens were significantly greater than those
      assigned to placebo. Women assigned to CEE plus continuous MPA had significantly 
      greater increases in spinal BMD (increase of 5%) than those assigned to the other
      3 active regimens (average increase, 3.8%). Findings were similar among those
      adhering to assigned therapy, although, among adherent participants, there were
      no significant differences in BMD changes among the 4 active treatment groups.
      Older women, women with low initial BMD, and those with no previous hormone use
      gained significantly more bone than younger women, women with higher initial BMD,
      and those who had used hormones previously. CONCLUSIONS Postmenopausal women
      assigned to placebo demonstrated decreased BMD at the spine and hip, whereas
      women assigned to estrogen therapy increased BMD during a 36-month period. These 
      findings demonstrate that estrogen replacement therapy increases BMD at
      clinically important sites.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study on the effect of 
      oral oestradiol on acute menopausal symptoms.
PG  - 115-23
AB  - Acute menopausal symptoms occur less frequently in Asian than in Caucasian women.
      Oestrogen replacement therapy has been shown to be effective in controlling acute
      symptoms in Caucasians, but the effect of oestrogens is not well documented in
      Asian women. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of
      the effect of oral oestradiol on the incidence of acute menopausal symptoms was
      conducted in 83 Hong Kong Chinese women who had experienced a surgical menopause.
      Although there was a significant increase in the oestradiol concentration with
      treatment compared with placebo (P  0.001), there were no significant
      differences in the reporting of symptoms between the treatment and placebo
      groups. There is no obvious explanation for this apparent lack of effect of
      oestrogen on acute menopausal symptoms in Chinese women. Whilst it may be related
      to the generally low incidence of symptoms or to a higher dietary intake of
      phytoestrogens in Chinese women, further studies are necessary to explain these
      findings.

TI  - Efficacy and local tolerance of a low-dose, 7-day matrix estradiol transdermal
      system in the treatment of menopausal vasomotor symptoms.
PG  - 587-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy and local tolerance of a new matrix
      transdermal drug-delivery system that delivers 0.02 mg of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) 
      daily for 7 days for the relief of vasomotor symptoms. METHODS A total of 324
      surgically or naturally menopausal women, all with prior hysterectomy and
      moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (56-140 hot flushes per week, with episodes
      of sweating, during a baseline observation period), participated in two
      independent, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. After
      a 4-week, treatment-free period, each woman received a continuous regimen of
      either one E2 transdermal system, two E2 transdermal systems, or placebo
      transdermal system(s) applied every week for 12 weeks. Efficacy was measured as
      reduction in hot flush frequency, determined from subject diaries. To measure
      local tolerance, skin irritation (erythema and edema) was objectively and
      systematically evaluated under blue light after removal of the transdermal
      system(s). Serum E2 and estrone concentrations were determined in one of the
      studies during baseline and on days 1, 9, 30, 58, 79, and 84. RESULTS Mean hot
      flush frequency decreased from 80 hot flushes per week at baseline to
      approximately 13 hot flushes per week (84% decrease) after 12 weeks of
      transdermal E2 treatment. Compared with placebo, the decrease in hot flush
      frequency was significant as early as weeks 2 and 3, and was maintained through
      the end of the study. Few clinically significant skin reactions occurred, and
      only nine (3%) of the subjects withdrew because of a skin effect. After initial
      increase, serum E2 concentrations remained stable throughout the study, achieving
      values of approximately 20 and 40 pgmL above baseline for one and two E2
      transdermal systems, respectively. CONCLUSION The E2 transdermal system
      effectively reduced the frequency of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms as
      early as the second week of therapy and was very well tolerated. The decrease in 
      hot flush frequency was similar to that reported for oral and other transdermal
      estrogens, but at lower serum E2 concentrations. This result may be due to the
      stable E2 blood level achieved with this transdermal system.

TI  - Cancer incidence and mortality in women receiving estrogen and estrogen-progestin
      replacement therapy--long-term follow-up of a Swedish cohort.
PG  - 327-32
AB  - We analyzed cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of 22,597 Swedish women
      who were prescribed replacement hormones. After 13 years of follow-up in national
      registries, 2,330 incident cancer cases and 848 cancer deaths were observed.
      Overall, our results were reassuring since incidence rate ratios (SIRs) for 16
      cancer sites and mortality ratios (SMRs) for all 10 examined sites were at, or
      lower than, unity. However, we found that exposure to an estrogen-progestin
      combined brand was associated with an increasing relative risk of breast cancer
      with follow-up time, the SIR reaching 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.8) after 10 years of
      follow-up. The relative risk of endometrial cancer was substantially increased,
      with the highest SIR of 5.0 (95% CI 1.6-5.9) in women prescribed estrogens alone,
      whereas those given an estrogen-progestin combination showed no elevation in
      risk. The risk estimates for liver and biliary tract cancers and for colon cancer
      were reduced by about 40%, notably in women prescribed the estradiol-progestin
      compound. Further detailed analyses revealed no evidence of adverse or protective
      effects on the risk of ovarian, uterine cervical, vulvarvaginal, rectal,
      pancreatic, renal, lung, thyroid and other endocrine cancers, brain tumors,
      malignant melanoma or other skin cancers. Hormone replacement therapy was not
      associated with an increase in mortality for any cancer site, at this time of
      follow-up. For breast and endometrial cancers, SMRs were below baseline but
      tended to increase with follow-up time. We conclude that hormone replacement
      increases the endometrial-cancer risk after unopposed estrogens and the
      breast-cancer risk-notably after estrogen-progestin combined therapy-and
      tentatively suggest that it exerts a protective effect against colon and liver
      cancer risks.

      postmenopausal women.
PG  - 177-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of transdermal estradiol-17 beta and oral
      conjugated equine estrogen when combined with an oral progestin on quality of
      life in post-menopausal women. DESIGN Randomized controlled double-blind trial. 
      A randomization error lead to the exclusion of six subjects but the soundness of 
      the remaining randomization was confirmed. SETTING Large urban community.
      PATIENTS Women 2-7 years after menopause with a uterus and ovaries, and not
      currently using hormone replacement therapy. Seventy-four women completed the
      trial. INTERVENTIONS After baseline measures of quality of life, subjects were
      randomly assigned to either continuous oral conjugated equine estrogen 0.625 mg
      daily or continuous transdermal estradiol-17 beta 50 mcg twice weekly, for four
      4-week cycles. Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg oral tablets was administered to
      both groups for the last 12 days of each cycle. OUTCOMES MEASURED Quality of
      life was determined using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire.
      Tolerability was determined by a specifically designed list of adverse effects.
      Both measures were recorded at base-line and in mid-cycle during the second,
      third and fourth cycles of treatment. RESULTS There were no statistically
      significant differences in any of the domains at baseline between the oral and
      transdermal treatment groups. In the vasomotor domain-scores for the oral and
      transdermal groups improved from baseline levels of 3.14 and 3.09, respectively, 
      to 1.32 and 1.23; physical domain scores improved from 2.45 and 2.73 to 2.04 and 
      1.78; psychosocial domain scores improved from 2.72 and 3.04 to 2.21 and 1.94;
      sexual domain scores improved from 2.32 and 2.16 to 1.64 and 1.30. There were no 
      statistically significant group differences or timegroup interactions. Both
      forms of therapy were equally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS Improvement in all
      domains, measured by the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, was
      observed in both the oral and transdermal groups. In the absence of a placebo
      control group, the improvements observed cannot be attributed solely to the
      therapy. Neither form of therapy offered an advantage over the other in respect
      to improvement in quality of life.

      age 50 +- 4 years), which was treated with elemental calcium, 1 gday; and the
      calcitonin group (mean age 50 +- 5 years), which was treated for 10 days each
      month with eel calcitonin, 40 IUday and with elemental calcium, 500 mgday.
      Full-body bone densitometry, for measuring total body bone mineral content
      (TBBMC), was carried out in all the women at baseline and 1 year. TBBMC was
      corrected for body weight by dividing its value by body weight (TBBMCW).
      RESULTS After 1 year TBBMCW was lower in every group -2.14% (P  0.001) in the
      control group; -0.14% (P = NS) in the HRT group (P  0.05 vs. controls); -0.18%
      (P = NS) in the calcium group (P  0.05 vs. controls); and -0.06% (P = NS) in the
      calcitonin group (P  0.01 vs. controls; P  0.05 vs. calcium and HRT).
      CONCLUSIONS These findings show that all three treatments are effective in the
      prevention of postmenopausal loss of bone mass.

      postmenopausal women. A randomised, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy
      study.
PG  - 105-14
AB  - Two-hundred and fourteen (214) menopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor
      symptoms, aged 40-65 years, were randomised. After a 4-week treatment-free
      period, each women received a continuous regimen of Menorest 50 twice weekly or
      Premarin 0.625 mg daily, for 12 weeks. Didrogesterone 10 mg was also given to all
      women for 12 days of every 28-day cycle. The objectives were to compare the
      efficacy and safety profiles of Menorest and an oral estrogen. A statistically
      significant reduction in the mean number of hot flushes occurred in each group
      compared to baseline with a decrease from 7.1 at baseline to 0.9 at 12 weeks in
      the Menorest group, and from 6.7 to 0.5 in the oral estrogen group; there was no 
      statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.36). With each
      successive treatment cycle, there was a continuous improvement in the number of
      hot flushes. The incidence and severity of menopausal symptoms were reduced in
      the same manner in both groups. There were no statistically significant
      differences in the mean plasma estradiol and estrone concentrations between the
      two treatment groups after 10 weeks of therapy. The mean estradiol to estrone
      ratio was similar in both groups, as was the number of adverse events observed.
      In summary, Menorest was as effective as an oral estrogen in alleviating
      menopausal symptoms.

TI  - Combined therapy with estrogen and etidronate has an additive effect on bone
      mineral density in the hip and vertebrae four-year randomized study.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - BACKGROUND Administration of estrogen or etidronate has been shown to increase
      bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. This 4-year, prospective,
      randomized study was carried out to monitor any added beneficial effect on bone
      mineral density when hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) was combined with
      etidronate. PATIENTS AND METHODS Fifty-eight early postmenopausal women
      attending metabolic bone disease outpatient clinics were randomly allocated into 
      four treatment groups and monitored for up to 4 years. All patients received 1.0 
      gd of elemental calcium. In addition, group 1 received percutaneously
      administered HRT (n = 15); group 2, intermittent cyclical etidronate (ICE) (n =
      14); group 3, HRT and ICE (n = 15); and group 4, calcium alone (n = 14). The bone
      mineral density (measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), biochemical
      variables of bone turnover, including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and
      urinary hydroxyprolinecreatinine ratios were measured before treatment and at 2 
      and 4 years after treatment. RESULTS In patients who received the combined
      therapy, bone mineral density was increased in the vertebrae by 10.9% (P  0.001)
      and in the femora by 7.25% (P  0.001) at 4 years. For patients treated with ICE,
      the increase was 6.79% (P  0.001) and 1.20% (P  0.05), and with HRT, 6.78% (P 
      0.001) and 4.01% (P  0.01) in the vertebrae and femora, respectively. The group 
      treated with calcium alone lost 3.81% (P  0.01) and 4.96% (P  0.01) of bone
      mineral density in vertebrae and femora. Patients who received no specific
      therapy lost 8.58% (P  0.01) from vertebrae, and 7.83% (P  0.01) from the
      femora over 4 years. Patients who received combined therapy had significantly
      higher bone mineral density in both vertebrae (P  0.05) and femora (P  0.01),
      in comparison to patients who were treated with HRT, or ICE, alone. Three of 9
      patients (33%) in the ICE group developed osteomalacia, as shown by bone
      histomorphometry, whereas in women who received combined HRT and ICE therapies,
      none of the 11 patients tested had evidence of bone mineralization defects.
      CONCLUSION This 4-year, prospective, randomized study in early postmenopausal
      women showed an additive effect of ICE and HRT on the bone mineral density in
      both vertebrae and the hip. Furthermore, the combined therapy prevented the
      occurrence of osteomalacia associated with etidronate. This is the first study to
      demonstrate the effects of etidronate in early postmenopausal women, and the
      additive beneficial effects of HRT and ICE on bone mineral density.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of calcium and estrogen administration on bone mass and

PG  - 131-5
AB  - We evaluated the effects of low-dose ethinylestradiol administration in the
      prevention of the rapid bone loss that follows ovariectomy in women. After 10-30 
      days from surgery, patients received either a sole calcium supplementation 500
      mgday (n = 20) or ethinylestradiol 20 microgramsday in addition to the same
      daily calcium supplement (n = 21), for 12 months. In the control group, urinary
      hydroxyproline excretion, serum alkaline phosphatase and plasma bone Gla protein 
      levels presented a substantial (p  0.05) increase, while radial bone density
      significantly (p  0.05) decreased 6 months after surgery. In the
      ethinylestradiol-treated group, the patterns of biochemical markers indicated
      that ethinylestradiol can restrain the bone remodelling processes. Radial bone
      density showed no significant modification during the 12 months' study period. In
      conclusions, these results demonstrate that the administration of 20
      microgramsday of ethinylestradiol can prevent the rapid bone loss that follows
      ovariectomy.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE To examine who may benefit from estrogen replacement therapy
      from a quality of life (QoL) perspective, taking both disease-specific and
      general aspects at baseline into account. DESIGN A double-blind multi-center
      randomized placebo-controlled prospective study. The subjects were randomized to 
      receive either transdermal estradiol or placebo for 12 weeks. QoL measures were
      disease-specific and generic. LOCATION University hospital, teaching hospital
      and private practice. MATERIAL Post-menopausal volunteering Swedish women (n =
      223) with mild to severe climacteric symptoms, as clinically evaluated by the
      Kupperman's Index. RESULTS All QoL assessments showed highly significant
      improvement in the estradiol group in comparison with the placebo group. The
      women receiving placebo treatment also improved, but their improvement reached a 
      peak at six weeks of treatment and then declined. In the estradiol group the
      improvement continued throughout the 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment the
      change in the placebo-treated group was smaller on the disease-specific scales
      than on the generic scales and the Kupperman's Index. A high correlation was seen
      between the baseline score for a certain QoL assessment and the change in this
      score during treatment. The most striking result was that the mean change in QoL 
      for the two groups was statistically significant for almost any pre-treatment QoL
      status. CONCLUSIONS Women with slightly, moderately or severely diminished QoL
      status would benefit from estrogen treatment during the climacteric period. A
      similar tendency was seen in women with mild symptoms at baseline.

TI  - Hormone replacement therapy and endometrial cancer risk a meta-analysis.
PG  - 304-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE To assess the association of unopposed estrogen or estrogen plus
      progestin and the risk of developing endometrial cancer or dying of that disease.
      DATA SOURCES A literature search of English-language studies was performed using
      MEDLINE, a review of bibliographies, and consultations with experts. METHODS OF
      STUDY SELECTION We identified 30 studies with adequate controls and risk
      estimates. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Risk estimates were extracted by two
      authors and summarized using meta-analytic methods. The summary relative risk
      (RR) was 2.3 for estrogen users compared to nonusers (95% confidence interval
      [CI] 2.1-2.5), with a much higher RR associated with prolonged duration of use
      (RR 9.5 for 10 or more years). The summary RR of endometrial cancer remained
      elevated 5 or more years after discontinuation of unopposed estrogen therapy (RR 
      2.3). Interrupting estrogen for 5-7 days per month was not associated with lower 
      risk than daily use. Users of unopposed conjugated estrogen had a greater
      increase in RR of developing endometrial cancer than users of synthetic
      estrogens. The risk for endometrial cancer death was elevated among unopposed
      estrogen users (RR 2.7, 95% CI 0.9-8.0). Among estrogen plus progestin users,
      cohort studies showed a decreased risk of endometrial cancer (RR 0.4), whereas
      case-control studies showed a small increase (RR 1.8). CONCLUSIONS Endometrial
      cancer risk increases substantially with long duration of unopposed estrogen use,
      and this increased risk persists for several years after discontinuation of
      estrogen. Although not statistically significant, the risk of death from
      endometrial cancer among unopposed estrogen users is increased, similar to the
      increased risk of developing the disease. Data regarding risk for endometrial
      cancer among estrogen plus progestin users are limited and conflicting.

TI  - Prevention of early postmenopausal bone loss using low doses of conjugated
      estrogens and the non-hormonal, bone-active drug ipriflavone.
PG  - 462-6
AB  - Hormone replacement therapy is the optimal therapeutic choice for postmenopausal 
      syndrome. While low doses of estrogens (0.3 mgday of conjugated estrogens) can
      counteract neurovegetative menopausal symptoms, higher doses (0.625 mgday of
      conjugated estrogens) are required to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women. 
      Experimental and clinical studies have shown that ipriflavone, a non-hormonal
      isoflavone derivative, is effective in the prevention and treatment of
      postmenopausal osteoporosis. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate
      the efficacy and tolerability of ipriflavone and very low doses of equine
      conjugated estrogens on bone loss in early postmenopausal women. Eighty-three
      healthy postmenopausal women (50.3 +- 0.7 years) were enrolled for this 1-year
      multicenter study. All subjects were randomly allocated to receive double
      placebo (n = 24; group A), placebo plus conjugated equine estrogens 0.30 mgday
      (n = 31; group B) or conjugated equine estrogens 0.30 mgday plus oral
      ipriflavone 200 mg tris in die at meals (n = 28; group C), according to a
      double-masked design. Among women who completed the treatment period (valid
      completers), those of group A showed a progressive decrease in forearm bone
      density (FBD; measured by dual photon absorptiometry) that reached 1.7% after 12 
      months. The women in group B maintained their FBD in the first 6 months of
      treatment but, at the end of the study, showed a bone loss of 1.4% compared with 
      basal values. By contrast, women in group C showed a significant increase in FBD 
      after 1 year of treatment (+5.6%; p  0.01). Both valid completers and intention 
      to treat analyses revealed a significant difference (p  0.05) between group A
      and group C over the study period. None of the treatments produced significant
      changes of biochemical markers of bone turnover, while hot flushes and other
      climacteric symptoms were significantly reduced after the sixth month of
      treatment in women receiving estrogens. Adverse events were generally mild, and
      did not differ among the groups. The results of this study suggest that low doses
      of estrogens combined with ipriflavone could represent a new therapeutic approach
      to the treatment of the postmenopausal syndrome.

PG  - 97-103
AB  - OBJECTIVE To determine whether augmentation of dietary calcium is effective in
      the prevention of early postmenopausal bone loss. DESIGN Three-arm,
      placebo-controlled, randomized parallel trial. The study duration was 2.9 +- 1.1
      (SD) years. SETTING General community. PARTICIPANTS 118 healthy, white women 3 
      to 6 years after spontaneous menopause, recruited by community announcement.
      INTERVENTIONS Random allocation to daily intake of 1700 mg of calcium (calcium
      carbonate given in divided doses with meals); placebo; or conjugated equine
      estrogens (0.625 mg; days 1 to 25), progesterone (10 mg; days 16 to 25), and 1700
      mg of elemental calcium daily. Each participant received 400 IU of vitamin D
      daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Total body calcium measured by delayed gamma
      neutron activation analysis and whole-body counting; bone mineral density of the 
      spine, femur, and radius measured by photon absorptiometry. RESULTS Bone mineral
      density declined in the placebo group for the lumbar spine (-2.1%y; 95% Cl, -3.3
      to -0.9), femoral neck (-2.0%y; Cl, -2.6 to -1.2), trochanter (-1.6%y; Cl, -2.4
      to -0.8), Ward triangle (-2.7%y; Cl, -3.7 to -1.7), and total body calcium
      (-2.0%y; Cl, -2.2 to -1.8). Rates of change were intermediate for calcium
      augmentation compared with placebo and estrogen-progesterone-calcium but
      statistically significant compared with placebo for total body calcium (-0.5%y; 
      Cl, -0.9 to -0.1; P = 0.006) and the femoral neck (-0.8%y; Cl, -1.4 to -0.2; P =
      0.03). CONCLUSIONS Although less effective than estrogen-progesterone-calcium,
      calcium augmentation alone significantly retards bone loss from the femoral neck 
      and improves calcium balance in recently postmenopausal women. Dietary calcium
      augmentation should be recommended as a strategic option in helping to prevent
      early postmenopausal bone loss.

TI  - Postmenopausal hormone use and cholecystectomy in a large prospective study.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE To examine the association between postmenopausal hormone use and
      cholecystectomy. METHODS A prospective cohort study was performed, with
      follow-up every 2 years. Participants were 54,845 postmenopausal United States
      nurses, who reported both hormone use and cholecystectomy on mailed
      questionnaires. RESULTS Cholecystectomy was reported by 1750 women during 8
      years of follow-up. After adjusting for confounding factors, women currently
      using postmenopausal hormones were at an increased risk of cholecystectomy
      (relative risk [RR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-2.4) compared to
      never-users. For current users, the risk of cholecystectomy increased with
      increasing duration of hormone use (RR 2.6, 95% CI 2.2-3.1 for 10 years or more) 
      and higher doses of estrogen (RR 2.4, 95% CI 2.0-2.9 for users of 1.25 mg or
      more). Although the risk for past hormone users decreased substantially in women 
      who had discontinued use 1-2.9 years ago (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.0), a small risk
      persisted for women who had stopped taking hormones 5 or more years previously
      (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6). However, after controlling for time since last use,
      duration of past use had little or no effect on the risk of cholecystectomy (RR
      1.4 and RR 1.7 for past users of less than 2 years and 10 or more years'
      duration, respectively). CONCLUSION Women using postmenopausal hormones are at
      an increased risk of cholecystectomy. Women and their physicians should consider 
      the spectrum of risks and benefits when deciding whether to take hormones.

TI  - [Double-blind method of the effect of menopause symptoms, lipid profile, and
      endometrial thickness of continuous therapy with estradiol valerate and
      medroxyprogesterone acetate].
PG  - 354-60
AB  - Continuous combined therapy (CCT) using estrogens and progestagens has appeared
      as an alternative to avoid vaginal bleeding, which is characteristic of
      sequential hormone therapy, and the main reason for the stopping treatment.
      Irregular vaginal bleeding can occur at the beginning of treatment, but it has
      been observed that after a few months patients are in amenorrhea. Fifty
      postmenopausal women were studied in order to evaluate the clinical outcome. Half
      of them were treated with a product containing 2 mg estradiol valerate and 2.5 mg
      medroxiprogesterone acetate, while the other half received a placebo. Menopause
      symptomatology was recorded as described by Blatt-Kupperman, depression was
      evaluated with the use of Hamilton's test, lipid profile by enzymatic methods and
      endometrial thickness by transvaginal ultrasonography. Patients were evaluated at
      the beginning, third and sixth month of the study, following a double blind
      methodology. Symptomatology diminished both in patients under CCT and using
      placebo, although improvement was significantly greater in patient under CCT.
      Thus in the hormone treated group the Blatt-Kupperman score fell from 12.1 to 6.4
      and 3.2 in the third and sixth month respectively, while in the group receiving
      placebo the score fell from 11.5 to 6.3 in the third month and raised to 7.4 in
      the sixth month. Hamilton's test showed a significant improvement of depression
      only in patients under hormone therapy. Nineteen out of twenty five women using
      CCT had vaginal bleeding, showing no changes in the endometrial thickness during 
      the study. Finally, HDL-cholesterol was raised in 14.5% while LDL-cholesterol was
      lowered in 18.7% (p  0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Nylestriol replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. A three-year prospective 
      study.
PG  - 911-6
AB  - A three-year prospective study was carried out in 283 postmenopausal women to
      evaluate the effects of a long-acting estriol derivative-nylestriol. The women
      were randomly assigned into 3 groups group A (136 cases, nylestriol 2 mg2 wk), 
      group B (97, nylestriol 1 mg2 wk) and group C (50, placebo2wk). LDL-C decreased
      and HDL-C increased after 3 months of medication (P  0.05), but TC and TG not
      significantly changed in any group (P  0.05). No changes of lipids were found in
      group C (P  0.05). Serum ALP, CaCr and HprCr in fasting urine decreased in 3
      months in both group A and B (P  0.05), but not in group C (P  0.05). Forearm
      bone mineral content loss was restrained in groups A and B (P  0.05), but
      decreased markedly in group C (P  0.01). The Kupperman index scores decreased by
      about 50% after 3 months and 80% in 12 months in groups A and B. Nylestriol
      induced mild stimulatory effect on the uterine endometrium, and addition of 6 mg 
      of provera daily for 7-10 days every 6 months is recommended. Nylestriol
      exhibited no obvious effect on the breast. This study demonstrated that
      nylestriol can be used as an effective and acceptable estrogen replacement
      therapy for postmenopausal women.

TI  - Is sexual life influenced by transdermal estrogen therapy A double blind placebo
      controlled study in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 656-60
AB  - Two hundred and forty-two postmenopausal women between 45 and 65 years of age
      requiring hormone replacement therapy for climacteric symptoms were blindly and
      randomly allocated to treatment either with transdermal estradiol therapy
      (Estraderm 50 micrograms24h) (E) or placebo (P). The patches were changed twice 
      a week and treatment continued for 12 weeks. No progestogen supplement therapy
      was given during the study. No previous hormone replacement therapy had been
      given for the last six months and the women had had their last menstruation more 
      than six months ago. As a part of a larger study assessing women's quality of
      life, a Swedish version of 'McCoy's Sex Scale Questionnaire' was administered at 
      the start of treatment and after 12 weeks. This questionnaire contains nine items
      regarding different aspects of sexual life. The difference between the scorings
      at the start of treatment and after 12 weeks were calculated for each item and
      the values of the E and the P groups were compared. Items regarding 'satisfaction
      with frequency of sexual activity, sexual fantasies, degree of enjoyment, vaginal
      lubrication and pain during intercourse' were positively influenced in the E
      group compared to the P group. Items not affected were 'frequency of orgasm and
      sexual arousal'. A correlation between improved sexual life and quality of life
      was also found when the results from the McCoy scale were compared with a battery
      of quality of life questionnaires.

TI  - Influence of alpha-adrenergic blockade on the catecholamine response to exercise 
      at 4,300 meters.
PG  - 1471-7
AB  - This investigation examined the influence of alpha-adrenergic blockade on plasma 
      and urinary catecholamine responses to both exercise and high-altitude exposure. 
      Sixteen nonsmoking, eumenorrheic women (age 23.2 +/- 1.4 years, 68.7 +/- 1.0 kg) 
      were studied at sea level and during 12 days of high-altitude exposure (4,300 m).
      Subjects received either alpha-blockade (prazosin 3 mg/d) or a placebo in a
      double-blinded, randomized fashion. Resting plasma and 24-hour urine samples were
      collected periodically throughout the duration of the study. Further, subjects
      participated in submaximal exercise tests (50 minutes at 50% sea level maximum
      oxygen consumption [Vo2max]) at Sea level and on days 1 and 12 at altitude.
      Urinary norepinephrine (NE) excretion rates increased significantly over time at 
      altitude, with blocked subjects having greater values compared to controls.
      Plasma NE levels increased significantly with chronic altitude exposure compared 
      to sea level and acute hypoxia both at rest and during exercise. NE levels at
      rest were greater for blocked compared to control subjects during all conditions.
      Urinary and plasma epinephrine (EPI) levels increased dramatically, with acute
      altitude exposure returning to sea level values by day 12 of altitude exposure.
      EPI levels were greater for blocked compared to placebo both at rest and during
      exercise for all conditions studied. Changes in alpha-adrenergic activity over
      time at altitude were associated with select metabolic and physiologic
      adjustments. The presence of alpha-blockade significantly affected these
      responses during chronic altitude exposure. It was concluded that: (1)
      alpha-adrenergic blockade elicited a potentiated sympathoadrenal response to the 
      stress of both exercise as well as high-altitude exposure, and (2) the
      sympathetics, via alpha-adrenergic stimulation, contribute to a number of key
      adaptations associated with acclimatization to high altitude.

TI  - Effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and medroxyprogesterone acetate 
      on calcium metabolism: a prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover trial.
PG  - 1216-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the
      effectiveness of administering medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 20 mg/d) in
      either the first (protocol A) or last (protocol B) 12-week period as well as a
      6-month course of the GnRH agonist (GnRH-a; leuprolide acetate; 1 mg/d, SC) on
      calcium (Ca) metabolism. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover trial. SETTING: Clinical research center,
      university hospital. PATIENT(S): Twenty women were randomized into protocol A or 
      B, received either MPA or placebo along with GnRH-a, and were then crossed over
      at 12 weeks to placebo or MPA, for the final 12-week interval of GnRH-a therapy. 
      INTERVENTION(S): Collection of serum and urine samples and measurement of bone
      density. Sex hormone, calcitropic hormone, and bone density studies were
      performed at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks. RESULT(S): In both protocol A and
      B, LH and E(2) levels declined by 79%-81% and 83%-90% of the baseline,
      respectively, at 12 and 24 weeks. Serum Ca, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and
      osteocalcin; 2-h fasting and 24-h urinary Ca excretion; and urinary
      hydroxyproline levels all increased significantly during GnRH-a treatment alone. 
      Estimated Ca balance decreased significantly during GnRH-a treatment alone. The
      addition of MPA attenuated the increases in phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase,
      osteocalcin, and 2-h fasting and 24-h urinary Ca excretion, and the decrease in
      estimated Ca balance. Comparison of phase order demonstrated that MPA prevented
      24-h urinary Ca excretion and urinary hydroxyproline loss and decline in
      estimated Ca balance when it was added back during the second 12 weeks (protocol 
      B) but not during the first 12 weeks (protocol A). CONCLUSION (S): We conclude
      that sequential MPA appears to reverse in part the negative effects of GnRH-a on 
      calcitropic hormones and estimated Ca balance.

TI  - Evaluating minimal clinically important differences for the acne-specific quality
      of life questionnaire.
PG  - 1069-79
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Acne-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (Acne-QoL) is a
      responsive, reliable and valid instrument developed to measure the impact of
      facial acne across four dimensions of patient QOL. Score changes on this
      instrument have been used to report statistically significant treatment
      advantages for a low-dose oral contraceptive (Estrostep, containing
      norethisterone (norethindrone) acetate (NA) 1mg and ethinylestradiol (EE) [20,
      30, 35 mg] as compared with placebo in women with moderate acne vulgaris.
      However, the question remained if these statistically significant results were
      also clinically meaningful. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the statistically significant
      Acne-QoL benefits observed with NA/EE in terms of their clinical significance,
      and to compare the three different approaches for defining a minimal clinically
      important difference (MCID) for the Acne-QoL instrument. METHODS: Since the
      optimum method for estimating MCIDs has yet to be established, three different
      published approaches for determining MCIDs were applied and compared using data
      from two randomised, double-blind, placebo- controlled studies of the efficacy of
      NA/EE in the treatment of facial acne. RESULTS: Although the approaches differed 
      substantially, the resulting MCID estimates were comparable. Specifically, the
      MCID estimates ranged from 0.50-10.3 mean change per item, depending on the
      domain. The results showed that the statistically significant treatment
      advantages for NA/EE were also clinically significant. CONCLUSION: When applied
      to the change scores present, the results showed that the statistically
      significant treatment advantages for NA/EE were also clinically significant.

TI  - Sexual psychophysiology and effects of sildenafil citrate in oestrogenised women 
      with acquired genital arousal disorder and impaired orgasm: a randomised
      controlled trial.
PG  - 1014-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some postmenopausal women lose genital sexual responsivity despite
      preserved subjective sexual arousal from non-genital stimuli. When oestrogen
      replacement is without benefit, both the underlying pathophysiology and
      management of this acquired genital female sexual arousal disorder are unclear.
      We aimed to study the effect of sildenafil on sexual arousal and orgasmic
      functioning of such women. Secondly, we aimed to explore the concordance between 
      a detailed historical assessment of genital response in real life, with
      laboratory vaginal photoplethysmographic assessment of genital vasocongestion.
      DESIGN: Session one consisted of a semi-structured clinical interview to assess
      real life sexual arousal. Session two employed vaginal pulse amplitude and
      self-report questionnaire assessment of erotica-induced sexual arousal. Sessions 
      three and four were a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
      administration of sildenafil on orgasm latency, intensity, perception of genital 
      congestion and subjective arousal to erotica plus clitoral vibrostimulation.
      SETTING: University associated Sexual Medicine Clinic and Psychophysiology
      Laboratory. SAMPLE: Volunteer sample of 34 oestrogenised postmenopausal women
      with acquired genital female sexual arousal disorder and impaired orgasm.
      METHODS: Sildenafil (50 mg) or placebo administered over two laboratory sessions.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Orgasm latency and intensity during drug sessions;
      subjective and psychophysiological sexual arousal during photoplethysmography
      session. RESULTS: The erotic video significantly increased subjective sexual
      arousal in all women. Vaginal pulse amplitude responses varied from robust to
      absent. Although across all women, sildenafil improved neither arousal nor
      orgasm, subsequent analyses comparing high versus low vaginal pulse amplitude
      responders revealed significantly reduced latency to orgasm, and increased
      subjective sexual arousal and perception of genital arousal in the latter group
      of women. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that oestrogenised postmenopausal women
      with genital female sexual arousal disorder and orgasmic impairment based only on
      clinical assessment do not benefit from sildenafil. However, the
      photoplethysmograph had predictive value-those women showing low vaginal pulse
      amplitude response benefited from sildenafil compared with women with a higher
      response. Thus, oestrogenised women diagnosed with acquired genital female sexual
      arousal disorder may be a heterogeneous group and the photoplethysmograph might
      be useful in their further characterisation.

TI  - Assessment and treatment of hot flushes and menopausal mood disturbance.
PG  - 563-80
AB  - More than 1 million women are expected to reach menopause each year, many of whom
      will experience hot flushes and other neuropsychological symptoms that may
      diminish their quality of life. Hot flushes are the core symptoms that reflect
      the brain's response to the changing hormonal milieu of the menopause transition,
      particularly to the rapidly fluctuating and falling levels of estradiol. The
      physical symptoms of hot flushes and the associated changes in sleep, mood, and
      cognition will lead many women to seek medical care. It is critical to understand
      the interrelationship of hot flushes and other neuropsychological symptoms of the
      menopause transition so that treatment priorities can be established. For
      example, if sleep disruption explains most daytime neuropsychological problems in
      women with hot flushes, treating insomnia should be considered a priority.
      Alternatively, mood, cognition, and quality of life may be disturbed independent 
      of sleep problems. In such a situation, each symptom should be evaluated
      separately from any assessment of sleep. As recent data from the WHI establish
      the risks of long-term HRT use, concern about using HRT, even as a short-term
      intervention, has increased substantially. Although HRT remains the first-line
      treatment for hot flushes, the WHI findings have drawn attention to nonhormonal
      treatments of hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms. Growing evidence to
      support the efficacy of serotonergic antidepressants and other psychoactive
      medications in the treatment for hot flushes suggests that nonhormonal
      interventions will prove important alternatives to HRT. As further evidence of
      the benefits of psychoactive medications for menopausal symptoms is established, 
      the choice between using hormonal and nonhormonal therapies for management of
      menopausal symptoms will continue to evolve.

TI  - Recovery of ovarian activity in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea who
      were treated with cognitive behavior therapy.
PG  - 976-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) targeted to
      problematic attitudes common among women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea 
      would restore ovarian function. DESIGN: Randomized, prospective, controlled
      intervention. SETTING: Clinical research center in an academic medical
      institution. PATIENT(S): Sixteen women participated who had functional
      hypothalamic amenorrhea; were of normal body weight; and did not report
      psychiatric conditions, eating disorders, or excessive exercise. INTERVENTION(S):
      Subjects were randomized to CBT or observation for 20 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURE(S): Serum levels of E(2) and P and vaginal bleeding were monitored.
      RESULT(S): Of eight women treated with CBT, six resumed ovulating, one had
      partial recovery of ovarian function without evidence of ovulation, and one did
      not display return of ovarian function. Of those randomized to observation, one
      resumed ovulating, one had partial return of ovarian function, and six did not
      recover. Thus, CBT resulted in a higher rate of ovarian activity (87.5%) than did
      observation (25.0%), chi(2) = 7.14. CONCLUSION(S): A cognitive behavioral
      intervention designed to minimize problematic attitudes linked to hypothalamic
      allostasis was more likely to result in resumption of ovarian activity than
      observation. The prompt ovarian response to CBT suggests that a tailored
      behavioral intervention offers an efficacious treatment option that also avoids
      the pitfalls of pharmacological modalities.

TI  - Effect of garlic on lipid profile and psychopathologic parameters in people with 
      mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 637-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: The beneficial effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutyaryl co-enzyme A
      reductase inhibitors on cardiovascular risk reduction has been clearly
      established. Concerns have been raised that lowering blood cholesterol by other
      hypolipidemic drugs or by a non-pharmacologic approach may have deleterious
      effects on psychopathologic parameters. Garlic is one of the most commonly used
      herbal remedies and is considered to have hypocholesterolemic as well as other
      cardioprotective properties. Its effect on psychopathologic parameters has never 
      been reported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of garlic on lipid parameters
      and depression, impulsivity, hostility and temperament in patients with primary
      type 2 hyperlipidemia. METHODS: In a 16 week prospective double-blind
      placebo-controlled study, 33 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and no
      evidence of cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to receive either
      garlic or placebo. Garlic in the form of alliin 22.4 mg/day was given to 13
      patients, and placebo to 20. Both groups received individual dietary counseling. 
      The changes in lipid profile and the various psychopathologic parameters were
      determined at the beginning and end of the trial. The differences in lipid
      parameters were evaluated by Student's t-test. The psychological data were
      analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures and
      Neuman-Keuls test. RESULTS: No significant changes were observed in levels of
      total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides, or in the psychopathologic parameters 
      evaluated. CONCLUSION: Short-term garlic therapy in adults with mild to moderate 
      hypercholesterolemia does not affect either lipid levels or various
      psychopathologic parameters.

TI  - Effects of ospemifene, a novel SERM, on hormones, genital tract, climacteric
      symptoms, and quality of life in postmenopausal women: a double-blind, randomized
      trial.
PG  - 433-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, shows a
      potential for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.
      We studied the effects of ospemifene on hormone levels, genital tract organs,
      climacteric symptoms, and quality of life. DESIGN: A double-blinded study in
      which 160 postmenopausal women were randomly allocated to receive either
      ospemifene at three different daily doses (30, 60, or 90 mg) or placebo for 3
      months. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed among the study groups 
      in clinical characteristics or parameters reflecting estrogen action at baseline.
      Ospemifene reduced follicle-stimulating hormone and insulin-like growth factor I 
      levels, whereas estradiol failed to change at all, and luteinizing hormone was
      reduced only in the 90-mg group of ospemifene. In the vast majority of
      participants, the endometrium remained atrophic after 3 months of treatment with 
      ospemifene. Although the rate of proliferative endometrium slightly increased in 
      all groups, including placebo, no hyperplasia or bleeding occurred in any
      participant. Ospemifene had no effect on the appearance of proliferation marker
      Ki-67 in the endometrium as compared with placebo, and endometrial thickness
      increased by mean 0.4 to 0.6 mm (P < 0.01, P < 0.05 and P < 0.05 for 30, 60 and
      90 mg ospemifene, respectively). Uterine volume slightly increased (8.4%-14.7%)
      in the ospemifene groups (P > 0.05), perhaps as a result of increased uterine
      blood flow. The most conspicuous finding was the significant estrogenic effect on
      vaginal epithelium, as evidenced by an increase in intermediate and superficial
      cells in repeat Pap smears. Ospemifene was not observed to aggravate climacteric 
      symptoms or cause adverse events, nor did it suppress climacteric symptoms.
      CONCLUSIONS: Ospemifene at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg did not stimulate
      endometrium or aggravate hot flashes but clearly had a rather strong estrogenic
      effect on the vaginal epithelium during a 3-month treatment period. Such effects 
      would be advantageous if ospemifene were found to be effective in the long-term
      prevention of osteoporosis.

TI  - Better oral reading and short-term memory in midlife, postmenopausal women taking
      estrogen.
PG  - 420-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Considerable controversy surrounds the issue of whether estrogen
      influences cognitive function in postmenopausal women, and the results are far
      from consistent. For the most part, the cognitive processes studied have involved
      memory; to our knowledge, no previous studies have specifically examined the
      effects of estrogen on women's reading ability. DESIGN: To investigate reading
      and short-term memory in postmenopausal women treated with conjugated equine
      estrogens, we carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
      21 days in 60 midlife, postmenopausal women aged 32.8 to 64.9 years (mean 51.2
      years, SD 5.0 years). Women were evaluated for oral reading measured by Gray Oral
      Reading Tests (third edition) and for verbal memory using immediate and delayed
      recall on the Logical Memory and Paired Associate Learning subtests of the
      Wechsler Memory Scale and by a Sentence Span task. RESULTS: The group receiving
      daily treatment with conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin, 1.25 mg; Wyeth-Ayerst
      Labs, Philadelphia, PA, USA) showed better oral reading and verbal memory
      performance than the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Estrogen may have positive
      effects on oral reading and verbal memory in midlife, postmenopausal women.

TI  - Transdermal testosterone therapy improves well-being, mood, and sexual function
      in premenopausal women.
PG  - 390-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Circulating testosterone in women declines during the late
      reproductive years such that otherwise healthy women in their 40s have
      approximately half the testosterone level as women in their 20s. Despite this,
      research showing the benefits of androgen replacement has been limited to the
      postmenopausal years. In view of the known premenopausal physiological decline in
      testosterone, we have evaluated the efficacy of transdermal testosterone therapy 
      on mood, well-being, and sexual function in eugonadal, premenopausal women
      presenting with low libido. DESIGN: Premenopausal women with low libido
      participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, efficacy study of
      testosterone cream (10 mg/day) with two double-blind, 12-week, treatment periods 
      separated by a single-blind, 4-week, washout period. RESULTS: Thirty-four women
      completed the study per protocol, with 31 women (mean age 39.7 +/- 4.2 years;
      serum testosterone 1.07 + 0.50 nmol/L) providing complete data. Testosterone
      therapy resulted in statistically significant improvements in the composite
      scores of the Psychological General Well-Being Index [+12.9 (95% CI, +4.6 to
      +21.2), P = 0.003] and the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self-Rating Scale [+15.7 (95% CI,
      +6.5 to +25.0), P = 0.001] compared with placebo. A mean decrease in the Beck
      Depression Inventory score approached significance [-2.8 (95% CI, -5.7 to +0.1), 
      P = 0.06]. Mean total testosterone levels during treatment were at the high end
      of the normal range, and estradiol was unchanged. No adverse effects were
      reported. CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone therapy improves well-being, mood, and sexual
      function in premenopausal women with low libido and low testosterone. As a
      substantial number of women experience diminished sexual interest and well-being 
      during their late reproductive years, further research is warranted to evaluate
      the benefits and safety of longer-term intervention.

TI  - Hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 136-45
AB  - Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is effective for relieving vasomotor symptoms
      such as hot flash and vaginal atrophy and for preventing bone loss in
      postmenopausal and bilaterally ovariectomized women. However, compliance with HRT
      was reported to be low despite the benefits of HRT. In addition, results of
      several recent large-scale randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that
      protection from cardiovascular disease is not an indication for treatment with
      estrogen and progestin in postmenopausal women. Recent studies have demonstrated 
      that low-dose HRT is safe and effective for prevention of postmenopausal bone
      loss. Low-dose HRT has also been shown to be effective for reducing the number
      and severity of hot flashes, improving vaginal atrophy, and inducing favorable
      changes in lipids, lipoproteins and hemostatic factors. Moreover, low-dose
      regimens of CEE (conjugated equine estrogen) and MPA (medroxyprogesterone
      acetate) result in higher rates of amenorrhea and endometrial protection compared
      with the conventional dose of HRT. Low-dose HRT may improve the compliance rate
      and may be more effective than conventional-dose HRT for reducing the risk of
      breast cancer. On the other hand, it has been shown that transdermal estrogen
      treatment reduces the incidence and severity of hot flashes and that long-term
      treatment with transdermally administered estrogen is effective for protection
      against osteoporosis. Transdermal administration of estrogen is recommended in
      postmenopausal women with hypertriglycemia because this treatment has little
      effect on lipid metabolism. The serum estradiol level was reported to be closely 
      related to estrogenic effects on various tissues. An HRT regimen should be based 
      on the needs of each patient. Serum estradiol levels in women should be
      maintained at appropriate levels for benefits and not be excessively high in
      order to prevent side effects. Selection of the most appropriate regimen of HRT
      (dose, route of administration and schedule) for the needs of the individual are 
      important factors to increase the rate of continuation with HRT.

TI  - Hormone replacement therapy--is there a place for its use in neurology?
PG  - 413-24
AB  - Stroke remains the third leading cause of mortality in developed countries
      despite declining tendency over the past decades. As the leading cause of
      disability and second cause of dementia, primary prevention should be the main
      way to fight the disease, since therapy is not efficient enough. Several
      observations pointed to estrogen as a protective agent that may reduce stroke
      risk, however, studies have shown conflicting data. There is no strong evidence
      that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases stroke risk. Several studies
      have shown that HRT may reduce the risk of fatal stroke. Conflicting results have
      been found for Alzheimer's disease and HRT as well. An association between higher
      serum concentration of estradiol and decreased risk of cognitive decline has been
      found in some studies, supporting the hypothesis that estrogen concentration may 
      play a significant role in brain protection. Having in mind results of recent
      randomized trials, it is suggested that HRT should not be recommended on general 
      basis for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular
      diseases or for primary prevention of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's
      disease. Osteoporosis, cognitive decline and climacteric symptoms that are likely
      to impact on quality of life, speak in favor for recommendation of HRT use. On
      the other side, family history of breast carcinoma, mastopathy, thromboembolism, 
      in certain cases gallbladder disease, will discourage the commencement of HRT.
      Respecting the patient's preferences and having benefits and risks in mind as
      well as science advisory statements, individual counseling regarding HRT should
      be the leading concept in the healthcare of postmenopausal women.

TI  - Effects of long-term estrogen replacement therapy versus combined hormone
      replacement therapy on nitric oxide-dependent vasomotor function.
PG  - 4348-54
AB  - Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen may increase
      production of the predominant endothelium-derived vasodilator nitric oxide (NO)
      and consequently improve vascular reactivity. In contrast, concurrent progestin
      therapy may oppose this beneficial effect. We studied the effect of long-term
      estrogen HRT and combined HRT on vasomotor function and on plasma nitrate, which 
      reflects the amount of NO in the circulation. As lipid peroxidation affects NO
      production and impairs endothelial function, we also measured the amount of the
      in vivo lipid peroxidation marker urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha). The
      study group comprised 15 women receiving estradiol valerate HRT (mean age, 56 yr;
      treatment duration, 10.5 yr) and 15 women receiving combined HRT with estradiol
      valerate and levonorgestrel (mean age, 58 yr; treatment duration, 11.3 yr). The
      peak flow velocity (PFV) and pulsatility index of the common carotid and internal
      carotid artery and the abdominal aorta were measured by ultrasonography after
      long-term HRT (baseline), after a 4-wk pause and again 3 wk after reintroducing
      HRT. A statistically significant interaction between the groups and time points
      was observed in the PFV of the internal carotid artery (P = 0.011). In women
      taking estradiol valerate, the PFV values decreased significantly after
      withdrawal of HRT (P = 0.007) and increased again to the baseline level after
      reintroduction of therapy (P < 0.001). In women receiving combined HRT, the PFV
      remained stable over all study periods. At baseline, the PFV of women taking
      estradiol valerate correlated with the plasma nitrate concentration in the common
      carotid artery (r = 0.646; P = 0.009) and in the abdominal aorta (r = 0.579; P = 
      0.024). For pulsatility index and urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha)
      excretion, there were no significant differences between the groups. Our results 
      suggest that the favorable effects of long-term estrogen treatment on blood flow 
      are at least partly mediated through NO. The addition of levonorgestrel to the
      treatment regimen appears to abolish this effect.

TI  - Metformin or antiandrogen in the treatment of hirsutism in polycystic ovary
      syndrome.
PG  - 4116-23
AB  - Hirsutism is a common and distressing symptom frequently encountered in women
      with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), who also show relative insulin resistance.
      The aim of this trial, in which hirsutism was the primary end point, was to
      compare the efficacy of the oral antihyperglycemic medication metformin with that
      of an established treatment, combined ethinyl estradiol and cyproterone acetate. 
      Patients (n = 52) were randomized to receive either metformin (500 mg, three
      times daily) or Dianette (ethinyl estradiol, 35 micro g; cyproterone acetate, 2
      mg) treatment for 12 months, with assessments before treatment, at 6 months, and 
      at 12 months. Both objective and subjective methods of evaluating hirsutism were 
      used, and in addition, patient perceptions were examined. The results show that
      metformin is potentially an effective treatment for moderate to severe hirsutism 
      in women with PCOS. They also suggest that in some respects (Ferriman-Gallwey
      score and patient self-assessment), it is more efficacious than the standard
      treatment (Dianette). The objective evaluation of hair diameter reduction showed 
      that both treatments were moderately effective at multiple anatomical sites.
      Dianette treatment was responsible for profound suppression of androgen activity,
      in contrast to metformin, which induced negligible change. However, metformin did
      reduce markers of insulin resistance. The data suggest that hirsutism may be
      effectively treated by reducing hyperinsulinemia.

TI  - Transdermal delivery of sex steroids for hormone replacement therapy and
      contraception. A review of principles and practice.
PG  - 525-40
AB  - The percutaneous route is an effective method for delivery of reproductive
      hormones. Several transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) releasing estrogens,
      progestogens and androgens from patches attached to the skin are currently in
      clinical use. For women, transdermal systems have been developed for hormonal
      replacement therapy (HRT) and recently for contraception. HRT with patches
      releasing only estradiol (E2) should be supplemented with a progestogen to
      protect the endometrium. Patches simultaneously releasing both E2 and a
      progestogen are also available. Combined regimens are either continuous or
      sequential. In the latter, estrogen-only patches are applied for 14 days,
      followed by 14-day application of patches releasing both hormones. Transdermal
      HRT successfully treats menopausal symptoms and has a bone-sparing effect.
      Transdermal contraceptive patches deliver ethinyl E2 in combination with the
      progestogen norelgestromin. This system provides an effective contraceptive and
      acceptable bleeding pattern not different from that of oral contraceptives. The
      types of adverse events experienced are approximately the same as with oral
      contraceptives. Reactions at the application site cause about 3% women to
      discontinue the use of patches. Transdermal systems also have been designed to
      supplement testosterone in hypogonadal men. Testosterone released from patches
      produces positive effects on mood and sexual behavior and significantly increases
      bone mass. Men using testosterone patches have to be regularly monitored for an
      increase in prostate volume and changes in prostate-specific antigen.
      Reproductive steroids delivered by the skin avoid first-pass liver metabolism,
      typical of oral dosing; consequently, the liver tissue is affected to a lesser
      degree. Other advantages include rapid onset and termination of action,
      noninvasive self-administration and attainment of therapeutic hormone levels with
      low daily doses. Reduced frequency of dosing has the potential to improve patient
      compliance. While compliance is important for any hormone, it is particularly
      important for contraceptive purposes. Like oral delivery of sex steroids,
      percutaneous absorption is characterized by intra- and interindividual
      variability. New technologies under development, combining electronics and
      low-frequency ultrasound, have the potential to provide precise dosing as well as
      drug delivery "on demand."

TI  - An economic analysis of hormone replacement therapy for the prevention of
      fracture in young postmenopausal women.
PG  - 1479-88
AB  - Osteoporosis is a major public health problem that will become increasingly
      important as our population ages. It leads to fractures that deeply affect the
      patients' quality of life. Osteoporosis is recognised as a leading factor in
      healthcare cost worldwide. For years, experts have recommended hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT), consisting of oestrogen with or without progestin, as 
      the first-line therapy to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women. Recently
      published randomised, controlled trials and well-designed meta-analyses confirm
      that HRT has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include prevention
      of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. The disadvantages are the
      resulting adverse effects such as coronary artery disease, stroke, thromboembolic
      events, breast cancer and cholecystitis. In the light of these findings, medical 
      associations recommend against the routine use of oestrogen and progestin for the
      prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women. HRT, administered for
      the prevention of fractures in all young postmenopausal women, would have an
      additional cost/year of life gained that is too expensive. However, this strategy
      seems to be cost-effective when young postmenopausal women at high risk for
      fractures are selected. Even if this strategy seems attractive, the adverse
      effects of HRT are not acceptable. This situation implies that other treatments
      must be found to prevent or treat osteoporosis. Among them, calcium and vitamin D
      were shown to be cost-saving in osteoporosis and even costs-effective in
      osteopoenia in young postmenopausal women.

TI  - The anabolic effects of parathyroid hormone therapy.
PG  - 415-32
AB  - PTH represents an important new advance in the therapy of osteoporosis. As an
      anabolic agent, its potential might be substantially greater than that of
      antiresorptive agents. Clear evidence in human trials now documents the ability
      of PTH to stimulate cancellous bone formation and to reduce fractures. Because
      antiresorptive agents and PTH work by distinct mechanisms of action, it is
      possible that the combination of these agents could be significantly more potent 
      than either agent alone. There are other unanswered questions about PTH. More
      studies are needed to document an anabolic effect on cortical bone. In addition, 
      more large-scale studies are needed to further determine the reduction in
      nonvertebral fractures with PTH, especially at the hip. More information is also 
      required to determine the possible need for antiresorptive therapy after PTH.
      Protocols to consider PTH as an intermittent recycling therapy would be of
      interest. In the future, PTH is likely to be modified for easier and more
      targeted delivery. Oral or transdermal delivery systems may become available.
      Recently, Gowen et al [78] have described an oral calcilytic molecule that
      antagonizes the parathyroid cell calcium receptor, thus stimulating the
      endogenous release of PTH. This approach could represent a novel endogenous
      delivery system for intermittent PTH administration. Ultimately, when the
      anabolic and catabolic mechanisms of PTH can be clearly distinguished, both
      mechanistically and in molecular terms, it may be possible to develop PTH analogs
      that are more purely anabolic.

TI  - Bisphosphonate treatment of osteoporosis.
PG  - 395-414
AB  - Bisphosphonates represent the agents of choice for most patients with
      osteoporosis. They are the best studied of all agents for the prevention of bone 
      loss and reduction in fractures. They increase BMD, primarily at the lumbar
      spine, but also at the proximal femur. In patients who have established
      osteoporosis, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of vertebral fractures, and are the
      only agents in prospective trials to reduce the risk of hip fractures and other
      nonvertebral fractures. Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of fracture quickly. The 
      risk of radiographic vertebral deformities is reduced after 1 year of treatment
      with risedronate [68]. The risk of clinical vertebral fractures is reduced after 
      1 year of treatment with alendronate [69] and just 6 months' treatment with
      risedronate [157]. The antifracture effect of risedronate has been shown to
      continue through 5 years of treatment [158]. Alendronate and risedronate are
      approved by the FDA for prevention of bone loss in recently menopausal women, for
      treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and for prevention (risedronate) and
      treatment (alendronate and risedronate) of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.
      Alendronate is also approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men. Other
      bisphosphonates (etidronate for oral use, pamidronate and zoledronate for
      intravenous infusion) are also available and can be used off label for patients
      who cannot tolerate approved agents. Although bisphosphonates combined with
      estrogen or raloxifene produce greater gains in bone mass compared with
      single-agent treatment, the use of two antiresorptive agents in combination
      cannot be recommended because the benefit on fracture risk has not been
      demonstrated and because of increased cost and side effects.

AB  - The role of HRT for the prevention of osteoporosis has been clarified by the
      recent results of the WHI. There is consistent and favorable data from RCTs
      supporting the efficacy of HRT on the surrogate outcome of bone density at both
      cortical and trabecular sites, including a dose-response relationship. Both
      observational and RCT data provide support that HRT has a positive impact on the 
      reduction of vertebral and hip fractures. The unfavorable risk/benefit profile of
      HRT, however, strongly limits its use for prevention of osteoporosis, given that 
      there are other medications that have demonstrated fracture efficacy.

      women with osteopenia secondary to hypothalamic amenorrhea.
PG  - 3651-6
AB  - This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of 45
      patients evaluated the short-term effects of an oral contraceptive [Ortho
      Tri-Cyclen, 180-250 micro g of norgestimate (NGM) and 35 microg of ethinyl
      estradiol (EE)] on biochemical markers of bone resorption, formation, and
      osteoprotegerin in young women (mean age +/- SD, 26.5 +/- 6.3 yr) with
      hypothalamic amenorrhea and osteopenia. Body fat, endocrine, and cognitive
      function were evaluated as secondary endpoints. Biomarkers of bone metabolism
      were measured at baseline and after three cycles of NGM/EE or placebo. There were
      significant decreases in mean values of N-telopeptide [mean (SD), -13.4 (13.4)
      vs. 1.2 (23.8) nmol bone collagen equivalents (BCE)/mmol creatinine (Cr); P =
      0.001] and deoxypyridinoline [-1.2 (2.9) vs. -0.5 (1.5) nmol
      deoxypyridinoline/mmol Cr; P = 0.021] as well as significant decreases in bone
      specific alkaline phosphatase [-5.1 (3.5) vs. 0.4 (3.1) ng/ml; P < 0.001],
      osteocalcin [-5.9 (3.6) vs. -2.9 (3.7); P = 0.016], and procollagen of type I
      propeptide [-35.2 (44.6) vs. -0.2 (30.0) ng/ml; P = 0.025], but not
      osteoprotegerin [0.39 (1.46) vs. -0.2 (0.49) pmol/liter; P = 0.397] in the NGM/EE
      vs. placebo group. There were no significant differences between groups with
      respect to changes in cognitive function, mood, body weight, body mass index,
      body fat, percentage of body fat, and all endocrine levels except FSH, [-3.7
      (3.8) vs. -0.6 (2.1) IU/liter; P < 0.001, NGM/EE vs. placebo]. No serious adverse
      events were reported in either group. These results suggest that NGM/EE decreases
      bone turnover in osteopenic premenopausal women with hypothalamic amenorrhea.
      Further studies are needed to determine whether estrogen will increase bone
      density in this population.

AB  - One-year vertebral fracture risk reduction from clinical trials in adults with
      postmenopausal or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is reviewed. Data were
      obtained by conducting a literature search of osteoporosis medications using the 
      MEDLINE database, bibliographies of selected citations, and recent meeting
      abstracts. The methodologic quality of the trials was assessed using recently
      published criteria for ranking evidence. In prospective analyses, the 1-year risk
      of new morphometric vertebral fractures was reduced by risedronate 5 mg/d in two 
      3-year studies in postmenopausal women with prevalent vertebral fracture, and in 
      two 1-year studies in patients with or at risk for glucocorticoid-induced
      osteoporosis. The 1-year risk of clinical vertebral fractures was reduced by
      alendronate and raloxifene in post hoc analyses. Reduction of morphometrically
      identified vertebral fracture risk is a more stringent therapeutic goal than
      clinical vertebral fracture risk. Therefore, more weight should be given to data 
      from studies that use the morphometry to assess vertebral fracture incidence.

TI  - A comparison of two different dosages of conjugated equine estrogen in continuous
      combined hormone replacement therapy with progestin.
PG  - 584-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of two different dosages of conjugated
      equine estrogen (CEE) on preventing bone loss and relieving the symptoms of
      menopausal syndrome in women at an early stage of menopause. METHODS: A total of 
      236 postmenopausal women were randomly allocated to one of the following groups: 
      Group A: 0.625 mg CEE + 2 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) + 1 tab Caltrate-D
      per day; Group B: 0.3 mg CEE + 2 mg MPA + 1 tab Caltrate-D per day; Group C: 1
      tab Caltrate-D per day as the control group. The study was continued for 2
      years.The following parameters were monitored: (1) L2-4 bone mineral density
      (BMD) (measured with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEX)), (2) menopausal
      syndrome improvement (assessed by comparing Kupperman scores), (3) vaginal
      bleeding rate, and the thickness of the endometrium and breast in each group.
      RESULTS: Overall, 213 cases (90%) completed the 1-year study and 176 cases (75%) 
      completed the 2-year study. The percentage changes in L2-4 BMD at the 12th and
      24th month in Group A were +2.3% and +3.7%, respectively, with the posttreatment 
      values being significantly higher than pretreatment values (P < 0.001). The
      percentage changes were +2.7% at 12th month (P < 0.05) and +0.7% at 24th month (P
      > 0.05) in Group B. And that of Group C were -0.4% at 12th month and -1.6% at
      24th month (P > 0.05). L2-4 BMD in both Group A and B was significantly higher
      than that in Group C at 12th and 24th month (A vs C, P < 0.001; B vs C, P <
      0.05). Kupperman Scores were significantly reduced after 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24
      months in all 3 groups when compared with baseline (P < 0.001). Scores in Group A
      and Group B were significantly lower than that in Group C (P < 0.001). However,
      the vaginal bleeding rates in Group A were significantly higher than that in
      Group B or in Group C. There was no atypical hyperplasia of endometrium in the 3 
      groups by the end of the study. One patient in Group A developed superficial
      thrombophlebitis by the end of 12th month. CONCLUSION: Continuous combination of 
      CEE and MPA is effective in preventing bone loss and relieving the symptoms of
      menopausal syndrome in women at an early stage of menopause. The vaginal bleeding
      rates in the Group treated with 0.625 mg/d CEE were significantly higher than
      those treated with 0.3 mg/d CEE.

TI  - Local estrogen treatment in patients with urogenital symptoms.
PG  - 187-97
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Determination of the efficacy and safety of vaginally administered
      low dose (25 microg) micronized 17beta-estradiol in the management of patients
      with urogenital symptoms. METHODS: A total of 1612 patients with urogenital
      complaints were randomized to receive 25 microg of micronized 17beta-estradiol
      (n=828) or placebo (n=784) in a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled study
      running for 12 months. Female patients were treated once a day over a period of 2
      weeks, and then twice a week for the remaining of the 12 months with an active or
      placebo tablet. The assessment included full history-questionnaire, micturition
      diary, gynecologic and cystometric examination, transvaginal ultrasound, and
      serum 17beta-estradiol level determination. It was carried out at the beginning, 
      and after 4 and 12 months of treatment. RESULTS: The overall success rate of
      micronized 17beta-estradiol and placebo on subjective and objective symptoms of
      postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy was 85.5%, and 41.4%, respectively. A
      significant improvement of urinary atrophy symptoms was determined in vaginal ERT
      group as compared with the beginning of the study (51.9% vs. 15.5%, P=0.001). The
      maximal cystometric capacity (290 ml vs. 200 ml, P=0.023), the volume of the
      urinary bladder at which patients first felt urgency (180 vs. 140, P=0.048), and 
      strong desire to void (170 ml vs. 130 ml, P=0.045) were significantly increased
      subsequent to the micronized 17beta-estradiol treatment. The number of patients
      with uninhibited bladder contractions significantly decreased following
      micronized 17beta-estradiol as compared with pretreatment values (17/30,
      P=0.013). Side effects were observed in 61 (7.8%) patients treated with low dose 
      micronized 17beta-estradiol. Therapy with 25 microg of micronized
      17beta-estradiol did not raise serum estrogen level nor stimulated endometrial
      growth. CONCLUSIONS: Local administration of 25 microg of micronized
      17beta-estradiol is an effective and a safe treatment option in the management of
      women with urogenital complaints.

TI  - Management of osteoporosis in patients with gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 869-76
AB  - Osteoporosis is a frequent complication in the course of various gastrointestinal
      disorders. Since its pathogenesis is complex, and incompletely understood in
      comparison to the well-known pathomechanism of postmenopausal osteoporosis,
      adequate management is difficult. We first summarize those therapeutic options
      which have strong evidence in postmenopausal osteoporosis and, thereafter, we
      review those in the context of different gastrointestinal diseases. Treatment of 
      the underlying intestinal disorder seems to be most important to normalise
      altered bone metabolism and to prevent osteoporosis in patients with coeliac
      disease. In patients with osteoporosis associated with Crohn's disease, various
      treatment strategies (such as vitamin D, sodium fluoride, bisphosphonates) are
      discussed. In contrast to postmenopausal osteoporosis, interventional studies in 
      secondary osteoporosis are often limited by the small study population and data
      about the efficacy of any treatment in prevention of fractures are therefore
      lacking. Well-conducted, controlled studies with the endpoint of preventing
      fractures are therefore required to optimise the treatment of osteoporosis in
      these patients.

TI  - A double-blind placebo-controlled trial on the effects of 25 mg estradiol
      implants on the urge syndrome in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 78-83
AB  - The aim of this prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was 
      to determine the effect of systemic estrogen on the 'urge syndrome' in
      postmenopausal women. The trial took place in a tertiary referral urogynecology
      unit. Postmenopausal women with the 'urge syndrome' were randomly allocated to
      receive a 25 mg 17beta-estradiol implant or placebo implant. Serum estradiol
      levels and endometrial thickness were measured on entry to the trial and at 1, 3 
      and 6 months. The following outcome measures were employed:
      videocystourethrography, frequency volume chart, visual analogue score of
      symptoms, and King's Health Care Quality of life Questionnaire. Forty women were 
      included. Subjectively there was a significant improvement in urgency in both
      groups and urge incontinence in the estradiol group, but no significant
      differences between the groups. Objectively no significant differences were
      demonstrated between the groups. Nine women in the estradiol group had vaginal
      bleeding, and 5 had a hysterectomy during or after the study. Despite using
      numerous outcome measures to examine its effect, 25 mg estradiol implants did not
      produce a greater improvement in the 'urge syndrome' than placebo and had a high 
      complication rate.

TI  - Comparison of Pueraria lobata with hormone replacement therapy in treating the
      adverse health consequences of menopause.
PG  - 352-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pueraria lobata (PL) is used as a traditional Chinese herbal remedy
      for menopausal symptoms, as well as an ingredient in preparations for conditions 
      affecting menopausal women, such as osteoporosis, coronary heart disease, and
      some hormone-dependent cancers. The scientific basis for its action may be its
      action as a phytoestrogen. DESIGN: To examine the effects of PL in comparison
      with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on lipid profile, sex hormone levels, bone
      turnover markers, and indices of cognitive function. For the study, 127
      community-living, postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years were randomized to
      receive HRT (n = 43), PL (equivalent to 100 mg isoflavone; n = 45), or no
      treatment (n = 39) for 3 months. The following measurements were carried out at
      baseline and after 3 months for all participants: menopausal symptoms
      questionnaire; neuropsychological tests covering memory, attention, motor speed, 
      and word-finding ability; quality of life (SF36); lipid profile; urinary
      deoxypyridinoline; dietary phytoestrogen intake and urinary phytoestrogen;
      estradiol; follicle-stimulating hormone; and luteinizing hormone. RESULTS: Only
      participants in the HRT group showed a mean reduction in cholesterol and
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that was significantly different from that of
      the control group. No significant changes in lipid profile or
      follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were observed in the PL
      group compared with the controls. However, both the HRT and PL groups showed an
      improvement in Mini-Mental State Examination score and attention span compared
      with the case of participants receiving no treatment. HRT and PL had different
      effects on cognitive function; HRT improved delayed recall, whereas flexible
      thinking seemed improved in the PL group. CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to
      demonstrate a scientific basis for the use of PL for improving the health of
      postmenopausal women in general. However, the effect of PL on cognitive function 
      deserves further study.

TI  - Phytoestrogen supplements for the treatment of hot flashes: the Isoflavone Clover
      Extract (ICE) Study: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 207-14
AB  - CONTEXT: Clinical trials demonstrating increased risk of cardiovascular disease
      and breast cancer among women randomized to hormone replacement therapy have
      increased interest in other therapies for menopausal symptoms. Dietary
      supplements containing isoflavones are widely used as alternatives to hormonal
      therapies for hot flashes, but there is a paucity of data supporting their
      efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of 2 dietary supplements 
      derived from red clover with placebo in symptomatic menopausal women. DESIGN,
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 
      menopausal women, aged 45 to 60 years, who were experiencing at least 35 hot
      flashes per week. The study was conducted between November 1999 and March 2001 at
      3 US medical centers and included women who were recently postmenopausal (mean
      [SD], 3.3 [4.5] years since menopause) experiencing 8.1 hot flashes per day.
      Women were excluded if they were vegetarians, consumed soy products more than
      once per week, or took medications affecting isoflavone absorption. INTERVENTION:
      After a 2-week placebo run-in, 252 participants were randomly assigned to
      Promensil (82 mg of total isoflavones per day), Rimostil (57 mg of total
      isoflavones per day), or an identical placebo, and followed-up for 12 weeks. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was the change in frequency of hot
      flashes measured by participant daily diaries. Secondary outcome measures
      included changes in quality of life and adverse events. RESULTS: Of 252
      participants, 246 (98%) completed the 12-week protocol. The reductions in mean
      daily hot flash count at 12 weeks were similar for the Promensil (5.1), Rimostil 
      (5.4), and placebo (5.0) groups. In comparison with the placebo group,
      participants in the Promensil group (41%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-51%; 
      P =.03), but not in the Rimostil group (34%; 95% CI, 22%-46%; P =.74) reduced hot
      flashes more rapidly. Quality-of-life improvements and adverse events were
      comparable in the 3 groups. CONCLUSION: Although the study provides some evidence
      for a biological effect of Promensil, neither supplement had a clinically
      important effect on hot flashes or other symptoms of menopause.

TI  - Breathing during sleep in menopause: a randomized, controlled, crossover trial
      with estrogen therapy.
PG  - 68-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of different types of nocturnal breathing
      abnormalities in postmenopausal women and the effect of estrogen replacement
      therapy (ERT) on nocturnal breathing. METHODS: A prospective, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study was completed by 62 of 71
      recruited healthy women. The first 3-month treatment period with either estrogen 
      or placebo was followed by placebo washout for a month and then by a second
      treatment period with crossover to either estrogen or placebo. On a night after
      each treatment period, sleep was monitored with polysomnography, and breathing
      was assessed with a static-charge-sensitive bed and oximeter. For the respiratory
      variables, a sample size of 48 subjects was sufficient to give statistical power 
      of 85% with a significance level of P <.05. RESULTS: The occurrence of
      obstructive sleep apnea in all women was low (1.6%), but partial upper airway
      obstruction, manifesting as an increased respiratory resistance pattern, was more
      common (17.7%). Estrogen replacement therapy decreased the occurrence (P =.047)
      and frequency (P =.049) of sleep apnea but had no effect on partial upper airway 
      obstruction or arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation. CONCLUSION: Partial upper
      airway obstruction is the most prevalent form of sleep-disordered breathing,
      occurring ten times more frequently than sleep apnea in postmenopausal women.
      Unopposed estrogen replacement therapy has only a minor effect on sleep apnea and
      has no effect on partial airway obstruction.

TI  - Relation of aromatase gene polymorphism and hormone replacement therapy to serum 
      estradiol levels, bone mineral density, and fracture risk in early postmenopausal
      women.
PG  - 282-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: After the menopause, estrogen synthesis from androgens and androgen
      precursors by aromatase is the main source of circulating estrogens. AIM: To
      evaluate whether aromatase gene (CYP19)polymorphism affects circulating estradiol
      (E2) levels, bone mineral density (BMD), BMD change or fracture risk. METHODS: A 
      5-year randomized hormone replacement therapy (HRT) trial on 331 early
      postmenopausal women (mean baseline age 52.7 +/- 2.3 years). The participants
      consisted of two treatment groups: the HRT group (n = 151) received a sequential 
      combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg cyproterone acetate with or
      without vitamin D3, 100-300 IU + 93 mg calcium as lactate/day, and the non-HRT
      group (n = 180) received 93 mg calcium alone or in combination with vitamin D3,
      100-300 IU/day for 5 years. BMD was measured from lumbar spine and proximal femur
      (DXA) before and after the 5-year trial. All new symptomatic, radiographically
      defined fractures were recorded during the follow-up. The polymorphism (intron 4 
      TTTA repeat) of CYP19 was evaluated after PCR amplification of the polymorphic
      site. CYP19 polymorphism was divided into three repeat groups: short (length of 7
      or 8 in both alleles; n = 135), long (length of 11 or higher in both alleles; n =
      47), and medium (rest of the values; n = 149). RESULTS: Of the baseline
      characteristics, only physical activity was associated with CYP19 polymorphism (P
      = 0.04) and a borderline significance was observed with previous fractures (P =
      0.05). In the HRT or non-HRT groups, the 5-year serum E2 change was not
      associated with CYP19 polymorphism (P = 0.87 and 0.74, respectively). Further,
      the polymorphism did not influence the calculated annual changes of lumbar or
      femoral neck BMD during the 5-year follow-up in the HRT (P = 0.60 and 0.17,
      respectively) or non-HRT (P = 0.92 and 0.80, respectively) groups. In all, 28
      women sustained 33 fractures during the follow-up. The CYP19 polymorphism was not
      significantly associated with fracture risk (P = 0.89 and 0.23 respectively; Cox 
      proportional hazards model) in the HRT or non-HRT groups. CONCLUSIONS: CYP19
      polymorphism was not associated with circulating E2 levels, BMD values, or
      fracture risk in these early postmenopausal Finnish women. If such an association
      exists in women, it may become apparent in older age groups.

TI  - [The effects of hormone replacement therapy in menopause on symptoms of anxiety
      and depression].
PG  - 101-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Replacement of deficient hormones (hormone replacement therapy, HRT)
      is the main treatment modality in menopause. There is no concensus among
      researchers as to how HRT influences psychiatric symptoms that might develop
      during menopausal period. In this study we aimed to explore the effects of HRT on
      symptoms of anxiety and depression comparatively by using either estrogen or
      tibolone. METHOD: Women with natural menopause who applied to the outpatient
      Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department were included in the study.
      Subjects (n=70) were randomized into two groups with one group to receive
      17beta-estradiol and other group tibolon. All subjects were evaluated at baseline
      and after 3-months of HRT with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Hamilton 
      Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). RESULTS: Forty six of 70 patients completed the
      study. The 17beta-estradiol (n=23) and the tibolone (n=23) groups were similar
      with respect to age, education and occupational status. The time from onset of
      menopause was longer in the tibolon group. HARS and HDRS scores were
      significantly decreased after 3 months of HRT in both the 17beta-estradiol and
      the tibolone groups. The two drug regimens were not significantly different in
      this respect. CONCLUSION: HRT with 17beta-estradiol and tibolone improves
      symptoms of anxiety and depression in menopausal women.

TI  - Randomized placebo-controlled trial of androgen effects on muscle and bone in men
      requiring long-term systemic glucocorticoid treatment.
PG  - 3167-76
AB  - Long-term glucocorticoid therapy in men is associated with loss of bone and
      muscle mass as well as a decrease in serum testosterone. We tested the effect of 
      two androgens, testosterone and its minimally aromatizable analog nandrolone, on 
      muscle mass (dual x-ray absorptiometry), muscle strength (knee flexion and
      extension by isokinetic dynamometry), bone mineral density (BMD), and quality of 
      life (Qualeffo-41 questionnaire) in 51 men on a mean daily prednisone dose of
      12.6 +/- 2.2 mg. Men were randomized, double blind, to testosterone (200 mg mixed
      esters), nandrolone decanoate (200 mg), or placebo given every fortnight by im
      injection for 12 months. At 12 months, both androgens increased muscle mass (mean
      change from baseline +3.5%, +5.8%, and -0.9% in testosterone, nandrolone, and
      placebo groups, respectively, P < 0.0001) and muscle strength (P < 0.05). Lumbar 
      spine BMD increased significantly only in men treated with testosterone (4.7 +/- 
      1.1%, P < 0.01). There was no significant change in hip or total body BMD.
      Testosterone, but not nandrolone or placebo, improved overall quality of life (P 
      < 0.001). These results suggest that androgen therapy may have a role in
      ameliorating adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy such as muscle and bone
      loss and aromatization is necessary for androgen action on bone but not on
      muscle.

TI  - Cognitive changes associated with supplementation of testosterone or
      dihydrotestosterone in mildly hypogonadal men: a preliminary report.
PG  - 568-76
AB  - This study prospectively examined changes in cognition in hypogonadal men given
      testosterone (T) or older hypogonadal men given dihydrotestosterone (DHT) gel. A 
      battery of cognitive tests assessing verbal and spatial memory, language, and
      attention was administered at baseline (prior to medication) and again at days 90
      and 180 of treatment for men receiving T gel and at baseline and days 30 and 90
      of treatment for men receiving DHT gel. For men receiving T gel, circulating
      total T and estradiol (E(2)) were significantly raised compared with baseline,
      and a significant improvement in verbal memory was observed. For men receiving
      DHT gel, serum DHT levels increased and T levels decreased significantly compared
      with baseline, and a significant improvement in spatial memory was observed. The 
      results suggest that beneficial changes in cognition can occur in hypogonadal men
      using T replacement levels and DHT treatment, and these changes in cognition can 
      be reliably measured during a relative steady-state dose level. Further, our
      results suggest that aromatization of T to E(2) may regulate verbal memory in
      men, whereas nonaromatizable androgens may regulate spatial memory.

TI  - A randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial with phytoestrogens in treatment 
      of menopause in breast cancer patients.
PG  - 1213-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Phytoestrogens are popular in treatment of menopause, although
      scientific evidence is insufficient as to their efficacy. We studied the effects 
      of daily use of isoflavonoids on climacteric symptoms and quality of life in
      patients with a history of breast cancer. METHODS: Sixty-two postmenopausal
      symptomatic women were randomized to use either phytoestrogen (tablets containing
      114 mg of isoflavonoids) or a placebo for 3 months; the treatment regimens were
      reversed after a 2-month washout period. Fifty-six women completed the study.
      Menopausal symptoms were recorded on the Kupperman index and the visual analogue 
      scale, and working capacity and mood changes were assessed via validated
      questionnaires. In addition, we followed the levels of phytoestrogens,
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, and sex 
      hormone-binding globulin. Liver enzymes and creatinine were also assessed at each
      visit. RESULTS: The phytoestrogen regimen raised the circulating levels of
      phytoestrogens (daidzein, genistein, equol) 19- to 106-fold. The Kupperman index 
      was reduced by 4.2 +/- 9.6 (mean +/- standard deviation) (15.5%) during
      phytoestrogen use and similarly by 4.0 +/- 8.1 (14.7%) during placebo use (P
      nonsignificant). The quality of life parameters (working capacity, mood changes) 
      were unaffected by phytoestrogen. In addition, the phytoestrogen regimen caused
      no changes in FSH, LH, estradiol, or sex hormone-binding globulin. Phytoestrogen 
      treatment was well tolerated and caused no changes in liver enzymes, creatinine, 
      body mass index, or blood pressure. Of the 56 women, 25 (44.6%) preferred the
      phytoestrogen regimen, 15 preferred the placebo (26.8%), and 16 (28.6%) reported 
      no preference (nonsignificant). CONCLUSION: Pure isoflavonoids did not alleviate 
      subjective menopausal symptoms in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Isoflavones and cognitive function in older women: the SOy and Postmenopausal
      Health In Aging (SOPHIA) Study.
PG  - 196-202
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines the effects of a dietary supplement of isoflavones
      on cognitive function in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Participants for this
      6-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial were women
      who were in good health, were postmenopausal at least 2 years, and were not using
      estrogen replacement therapy. Between July 24, 2000, and October 31, 2000, 56
      women aged 55 to 74 years were randomized; 2 in the placebo group and 1 in the
      active treatment group did not complete the 6-month evaluation, and none withdrew
      because of adverse effects. Women randomized to active treatment (n = 27) took
      two pills per day, each containing 55 mg of soy-extracted isoflavones (110 mg
      total isoflavones per day; Healthy Woman: Soy Menopause Supplement, Personal
      Products Company, McNeil-PPC Inc., Skillman, NJ, USA). Women assigned to placebo 
      (n = 26) took two identical-appearing pills per day containing inert ingredients.
      Cognitive function tests administered at baseline and follow-up included the
      following: Trails A and B, category fluency, and logical memory and recall (a
      paragraph recall test assessing immediate and delayed verbal memory). RESULTS: At
      baseline, all women were cognitively intact; there were no significant
      differences by treatment assignment in age, education, depressed mood, or
      cognitive function (all P values > 0.10). Compliance was 98% and 97%,
      respectively, in the placebo and treatment groups; all women took at least 85% of
      their pills. The women in the treatment group did consistently better, both as
      compared with their own baseline scores and as compared with the placebo group
      responses at 6 months. Comparisons of percentage change in cognitive function
      between baseline and follow-up showed greater improvement in category fluency for
      women on active treatment as compared with the case of those on placebo (P =
      0.02) and showed (nonsignificantly) greater improvement on the two other tests of
      verbal memory and Trails B. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that isoflavone
      supplementation has a favorable effect on cognitive function, particularly verbal
      memory, in postmenopausal women.

TI  - A randomized trial of low-dose tamoxifen on breast cancer proliferation and blood
      estrogenic biomarkers.
PG  - 779-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer in women at high risk for
      the disease but increases the risk for endometrial tumors and venous
      thromboembolisms, possibly in a dose-dependent fashion. We compared the effects
      of tamoxifen at 1 mg/day and 5 mg/day with those of the standard dose of 20
      mg/day on breast cancer proliferation using a surrogate endpoint marker (Ki-67
      expression) and blood biomarkers associated with breast cancer, cardiovascular
      disease, and bone fracture risk. METHODS: We randomly assigned 120 women with
      estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer to tamoxifen at 1, 5, or 20 mg/day 
      for 4 weeks. Expression of the tumor proliferation marker Ki-67 and of biomarkers
      of breast cancer (insulin-like growth factor-I, sex hormone-binding globulin),
      cardiovascular disease (cholesterol, triglycerides, ultrasensitive C-reactive
      protein, fibrinogen, antithrombin-III), and bone fracture (type I collagen
      C-telopeptide) risk were determined before (baseline) and after treatment. All
      levels were compared with those in two nonrandomized control groups (34 women
      with ER-negative breast cancer and 29 additional women with ER-positive breast
      cancer). Data were analyzed by analysis of covariance. All statistical tests were
      two-sided. RESULTS: Expression of Ki-67 decreased in all three tamoxifen groups, 
      with no difference in the magnitude of reduction among groups (P =.81). Relative 
      to baseline, Ki-67 expression decreased by a median of 15.0% (95% confidence
      interval = 0.0% to 24.1%) among the tamoxifen groups but increased by 12.8% (95% 
      confidence interval = 0.0% to 19.6%) among the nonrandomized control groups.
      Several blood biomarkers showed dose-response relationships with tamoxifen,
      including decreased insulin-like growth factor-I, increased sex hormone-binding
      globulin, and decreased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, ultrasensitive
      C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and antithrombin-III levels. CONCLUSIONS: The
      effects on Ki-67 expression of lower doses of tamoxifen were comparable to those 
      achieved with the standard dose, although the effects on blood biomarkers were
      variable. The effects of lower doses of tamoxifen should be assessed further in
      randomized trials.

TI  - Paroxetine controlled release in the treatment of menopausal hot flashes: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2827-34
AB  - CONTEXT: Standard therapy for hot flashes has been hormone replacement with
      estradiol or progestational agents, but recent data suggest that antidepressants 
      inhibiting serotonin reuptake may also be effective. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine controlled release [CR]) in
      treating the vasomotor symptoms displayed by a general cross-section of
      menopausal women. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study conducted across 17 US sites, including 
      urban, suburban, and rural clinics. PATIENTS: A total of 165 menopausal women
      aged 18 years or older experiencing at least 2 to 3 daily hot flashes and must
      have discontinued any hormone replacement therapy for at least 6 weeks. Women
      were excluded if they had any signs of active cancer or were undergoing
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy. INTERVENTION: After a 1-week placebo run-in
      phase, study participants were randomized to receive placebo or receive 12.5 mg/d
      or 25.0 mg/d of paroxetine CR (in a 1:1:1 ratio) for 6 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Mean change from baseline to week 6 in the daily hot flash composite
      score (frequency x severity). RESULTS: Fifty-six participants were randomly
      assigned to receive placebo and 51 to receive 12.5 mg/d and 58 to receive 25.0
      mg/d of paroxetine CR. The mean reductions in the hot flash frequency composite
      score from baseline to week 6 were statistically significantly greater for those 
      receiving paroxetine CR than for those receiving placebo. By week 6, the mean
      daily hot flash frequency went from 7.1 to 3.8 (mean reduction, 3.3) for those in
      the 12.5-mg/d and from 6.4 to 3.2 (mean reduction, 3.2) for those in the 25-mg/d 
      paroxetine CR groups and from 6.6 to 4.8 (mean reduction, 1.8) for those in the
      placebo group. Mean placebo-adjusted reduction in hot flash composite scores were
      -4.7 (95% confidence interval, - 8.1 to -1.3; P =.007) comparing 12.5-mg/d
      paroxetine CR with placebo; and -3.6 (95% confidence interval, -6.8 to -0.4; P
      =.03) comparing 25.0-mg/d paroxetine CR with placebo. This corresponded to median
      reductions of 62.2% for those in the 12.5-mg/d and 64.6% for those in the
      25.0-mg/d paroxetine CR groups compared with 37.8% for those in the placebo
      group. CONCLUSION: Paroxetine CR may be an effective and acceptable alternative
      to hormone replacement and other therapies in treating menopausal hot flash
      symptoms.

TI  - Effects of rofecoxib or naproxen vs placebo on Alzheimer disease progression: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2819-26
AB  - CONTEXT: Laboratory evidence that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to neuronal 
      injury in Alzheimer disease (AD), along with epidemiological evidence, suggests
      that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may favorably influence the
      course of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with a selective
      cyclooxygenase (COX) -2 inhibitor (rofecoxib) or a traditional nonselective NSAID
      (naproxen) slows cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. DESIGN: 
      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial, 
      with 1-year exposure to study medications. SETTING: Forty ambulatory treatment
      centers affiliated with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study consortium.
      PARTICIPANTS: Participants with mild-to-moderate AD (Mini-Mental State
      Examination score of 13-26) were recruited from December 1999 to November 2000
      using clinic populations, referrals from community physicians, and local
      advertising. Stable use of cholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen, low-dose aspirin,
      and vitamin E was allowed. Participants with inflammatory diseases that might
      respond to the study medications were excluded. Of 474 participants screened, 351
      were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Once-daily rofecoxib, 25 mg, or twice-daily
      naproxen sodium, 220 mg, or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome
      measure was the 1-year change in the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive
      (ADAS-Cog) subscale score. Secondary outcome measures included the Clinical
      Dementia Rating scale sum-of-boxes, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Quality
      of Life-AD, and the time to attainment of significant end points (4-point decline
      from baseline ADAS-Cog score, 1-step worsening on the global Clinical Dementia
      Rating scale, 15-point decline on the ADCS activities of daily living inventory, 
      institutionalization, or death). RESULTS: The 1-year mean (SD) change in ADAS-Cog
      scores in participants treated with naproxen (5.8 [8.0]) or rofecoxib (7.6 [7.7])
      was not significantly different from the change in participants treated with
      placebo (5.7 [8.2]). Results of secondary analyses showed no consistent benefit
      of either treatment. Fatigue, dizziness, and hypertension were more commonly
      reported in the active drug groups, and more serious adverse events were found in
      the active treatment group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: The results of 
      this study indicate that rofecoxib or low-dose naproxen does not slow cognitive
      decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.

TI  - Baseline experience with Modified Mini Mental State Exam: The Women's Health
      Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS).
PG  - 217-23
AB  - The Modified Mini Mental State Exam (3MS) is widely used for screening global
      cognitive functioning, however little is known about its performance in clinical 
      trials. We report the distribution of 3MS scores among women enrolled in the
      Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) and describe differences in these 
      scores associated with age, education, and ethnicity. The 3MS exams were
      administered to 7,480 women aged 65-80 who had volunteered for and were eligible 
      for a clinical trial on postmenopausal hormone therapy. General linear models
      were used to describe demographic differences among scores. Factor analysis was
      used to characterize the correlational structure of exam subscales.The
      distribution of 3MS scores at baseline was compressed in WHIMS compared to
      population-based data. Mean 3MS scores (overall 95.1) tended to decrease with age
      and increase with education, however these associations varied among ethnic
      groups (p< 0.0001) even after adjustment for health, physical disability and
      occupation attainment. Four factors accounted for 37% of the total variance. Each
      varied with education and ethnicity; the two most prominent factors also varied
      with age. Despite relatively narrow distributions in WHIMS, baseline 3MS scores
      retained associations with age and education. These associations varied among
      ethnic groups, so that care must be taken in comparing data across populations.

TI  - The endocrinology of gonadal involution: menopause and andropause.
PG  - 77-81
AB  - Most aging individuals die from atherosclerosis, cancer or dementia. In the
      oldest old also loss of muscle strength resulting in frailty becomes the limiting
      factor for an individual's chances of living an independent life until death. Two
      hormonal changes mark the aging process in man. In women an acute drop in
      estrogen production by the ovaries around the age of 50 initiates a symptom
      complex called menopause. In men a more subtle drop of testosterone bioactivity
      from 40 yrs onwards might be accompanied by more difficulty to recognize
      symptomatology (andropause). Hormone replacement strategies in elderly women and 
      males with estrogens or androgens, respectively, has some clear advantages, but
      is currently controversial, because of the occurrence of adverse effects.

TI  - Effect of estrogen plus progestin on global cognitive function in postmenopausal 
      women: the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2663-72
AB  - CONTEXT: Observational studies have suggested that postmenopausal hormone
      treatment may improve cognitive function, but data from randomized clinical
      trials have been sparse and inconclusive. The Women's Health Initiative Memory
      Study (WHIMS) is an ancillary study of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)
      hormone therapy trials. On July 8, 2002, the estrogen plus progestin therapy in
      the WHI trial was discontinued because of certain increased health risks for
      women. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether estrogen plus progestin therapy protects
      global cognitive function in older postmenopausal women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
      PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial,
      WHIMS is an ancillary study of geographically diverse, community-dwelling women
      aged 65 years or older from 39 of 40 clinical centers within the WHI estrogen
      plus progestin trial that started in June 1995. Of 4894 eligible postmenopausal
      women aged 65 years or older and free of probable dementia at baseline, 4532
      (92.6%) were enrolled in the estrogen plus progestin component of WHIMS. A total 
      of 4381 participants (96.7%) provided at least 1 valid cognitive function score
      between June 1995 and July 8, 2002. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received either 1
      daily tablet containing 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen with 2.5 mg of
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 2145) or matching placebo (n = 2236). MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE: Global cognitive function measured annually with the Modified
      Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: The Modified Mini-Mental State
      Examination mean total scores in both groups increased slightly over time (mean
      follow-up of 4.2 years). Women in the estrogen plus progestin group had smaller
      average increases in total scores compared with women receiving placebo (P =.03),
      but these differences were not clinically important. Removing women by censoring 
      them after adjudicated dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or stroke, and
      nonadherence to study protocol, did not alter the findings. Prior hormone therapy
      use and duration of prior use did not affect the interpretation of the results,
      nor did timing of prior hormone therapy initiation with respect to the final
      menstrual period. More women in the estrogen plus progestin group had a
      substantial and clinically important decline (> or =2 SDs) in Modified
      Mini-Mental State Examination total score (6.7%) compared with the placebo group 
      (4.8%) (P =.008). CONCLUSIONS: Among postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older,
      estrogen plus progestin did not improve cognitive function when compared with
      placebo. While most women receiving estrogen plus progestin did not experience
      clinically relevant adverse effects on cognition compared with placebo, a small
      increased risk of clinically meaningful cognitive decline occurred in the
      estrogen plus progestin group.

TI  - Estrogen plus progestin and the incidence of dementia and mild cognitive
      impairment in postmenopausal women: the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2651-62
AB  - CONTEXT: Postmenopausal women have a greater risk than men of developing
      Alzheimer disease, but studies of the effects of estrogen therapy on Alzheimer
      disease have been inconsistent. On July 8, 2002, the study drugs, estrogen plus
      progestin, in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial were discontinued because
      of certain increased health risks in women receiving combined hormone therapy.
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of estrogen plus progestin on the incidence of 
      dementia and mild cognitive impairment compared with placebo. DESIGN, SETTING,
      AND PARTICIPANTS: The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, began enrolling
      participants from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin
      trial in May 1996. Of the 4894 eligible participants of the WHI study, 4532
      (92.6%) postmenopausal women free of probable dementia, aged 65 years or older,
      and recruited from 39 of 40 WHI clinical centers were enrolled in the WHIMS.
      INTERVENTION: Participants received either 1 daily tablet of 0.625 mg of
      conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 2229),
      or a matching placebo (n = 2303). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of probable
      dementia (primary outcome) and mild cognitive impairment (secondary outcome) were
      identified through a structured clinical assessment. RESULTS: The mean (SD) time 
      between the date of randomization into WHI and the last Modified Mini-Mental
      State Examination (3MSE) for all WHIMS participants was 4.05 (1.19) years.
      Overall, 61 women were diagnosed with probable dementia, 40 (66%) in the estrogen
      plus progestin group compared with 21 (34%) in the placebo group. The hazard
      ratio (HR) for probable dementia was 2.05 (95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.21-3.48; 45 vs 22 per 10 000 person-years; P =.01). This increased risk would
      result in an additional 23 cases of dementia per 10 000 women per year. Alzheimer
      disease was the most common classification of dementia in both study groups.
      Treatment effects on mild cognitive impairment did not differ between groups (HR,
      1.07; 95% CI, 0.74-1.55; 63 vs 59 cases per 10 000 person-years; P =.72).
      CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen plus progestin therapy increased the risk for probable
      dementia in postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older. In addition, estrogen
      plus progestin therapy did not prevent mild cognitive impairment in these women. 
      These findings, coupled with previously reported WHI data, support the conclusion
      that the risks of estrogen plus progestin outweigh the benefits.

TI  - The menopause and HRT. HRT and cognitive decline.
PG  - 105-22
AB  - It is biologically plausible that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) would be
      protective against cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We review
      observational and randomized trials to determine whether HRT might protect
      against cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired and demented women. We also
      address issues of clinical relevance, including duration and type of treatment
      and patient characteristics, including type of menopause (surgical versus
      natural), age, education and menopausal symptoms. Differences in participant
      characteristics and testing methods limit the ability to draw conclusions across 
      randomized studies of HRT in non-demented women. The available evidence suggests 
      no detrimental effect of HRT on cognitive function and inconsistent benefits on
      verbal memory and reasoning, frontal functions and speeded attention.
      Meta-analyses of observational trials suggest that HRT protects against the
      development of AD, but randomized trials indicate no long-lasting benefit in
      patients with AD. Evidence is insufficient to recommend HRT to maintain cognitive
      function.

TI  - Combination therapy with hormone replacement and alendronate for prevention of
      bone loss in elderly women: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2525-33
AB  - CONTEXT: Therapy with individual antiresorptive agents has been shown to be
      effective for prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, but
      whether combination antiresorptive therapy with hormones and bisphosphonates is
      safe or efficacious or how these agents compare in elderly women is unknown.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormone replacement and the bisphosphonate
      alendronate sodium in combination are efficacious and safe, and how they compare 
      with monotherapy in community-dwelling elderly women. DESIGN: Randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Five 
      hundred seventy-three community-dwelling women age 65 years or older were
      screened: 485 completed screening and 373 (aged 65 to 90 years) were randomized
      following a 3-month, open-label, run-in phase with hormone replacement and
      alendronate placebo. The trial was conducted at a single academic US medical
      center from January 1996 to May 2001. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly
      assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial design to receive hormone replacement (conjugated
      equine estrogen, 0.625 mg/d, with or without medroxyprogesterone, 2.5 mg/d) and
      alendronate, 10 mg daily, both agents, or neither. All participants received
      calcium and vitamin D supplements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annualized change in
      bone mineral density of the hip and spine and occurrence of adverse events.
      RESULTS: Bone mineral density at 3 years was significantly greater at all femoral
      and vertebral sites in women treated with combination therapy than with
      monotherapy, with mean (SD) increases of 5.9% (3.8) at the total hip, 10.4% (5.4)
      at the posteroanterior lumbar spine, and 11.8% (6.8) at the lateral lumbar spine.
      Mean (SD) increases in bone mass at the hip in women treated with alendronate
      alone were significantly greater than in those treated with hormone replacement
      therapy alone (4.2% [3.8] vs 3.0% [4.9]; P<.05, respectively), and alendronate
      resulted in more responders to therapy. All therapies were well tolerated and
      participant retention was 90% at 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with
      hormone replacement and alendronate was efficacious and well tolerated in this
      cohort. Alendronate was superior to hormone replacement, and combination therapy 
      was superior to either therapy alone. Combination therapy may represent an option
      for women with more severe disease or for those who have failed to achieve an
      adequate response to monotherapy.

TI  - Acute administration of conjugated equine oestrogen does not improve
      exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia in men with coronary artery disease.
PG  - 221-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The parenteral administration of oestradiol acutely protects against 
      exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia in women, but whether this effect is
      sex-specific is not known. AIMS: The effects of acutely administered conjugated
      equine oestrogen on exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia in men with established
      coronary heart disease were investigated in a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind cross-over trial. METHODS: Twenty men, aged 62 +/- 11.6 years, with 
      reproducible exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia were treated with either
      intravenous conjugated equine oestrogen (25 mg) or saline prior to undergoing an 
      exercise stress test. Primary end-points were total exercise time and time to 1
      mm ST-segment depression. RESULTS: All participants completed the protocol. Total
      exercise time exceeded the baseline value in 17 of the 20 men following saline,
      and in 17 of the 20 men following oestrogen pretreatment. Time to 1 mm ST-segment
      depression exceeded the baseline value in 14 of the 19 men following saline, and 
      following oestrogen administration, exceeded baseline in 13 of the 19 men. There 
      was no significant difference between the two treatments in either time to 1 mm
      ST-segment depression or total exercise time. A period effect was apparent for
      total exercise time (P = 0.05) but not for time to ST-segment depression.
      CONCLUSION: Acute parenteral oestrogen therapy did not increase total exercise
      time or time to the onset of electrocardiographic changes of ischaemia in men
      with chronic stable coronary artery disease. These findings contrast the
      favourable effects of oestrogen in women in comparable studies and indicate a sex

TI  - A roundtable discussion of aromatase inhibitors as therapy for breast cancer.
PG  - 213-22
AB  - This article summarizes the conclusions of a meeting of diverse breast cancer
      experts who discussed issues, controversies, and new clinical trial results
      relevant to the use of aromatase inhibitors for treating postmenopausal women
      with breast cancer. The new generation of aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole,
      letrozole, exemestane) have largely replaced megestrol acetate as a second-line
      therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive advanced breast cancer.
      In addition, anastrozole and letrozole have been shown to be superior to
      tamoxifen for first-line therapy. Finally, recent results suggest that
      anastrozole may be superior to tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for early stage
      disease in postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive disease.

TI  - Effects of a low-dose and ultra-low-dose combined oral contraceptive use on bone 
      turnover and bone mineral density in young fertile women: a prospective
      controlled randomized study.
PG  - 355-9
AB  - In this prospective, controlled, randomized study, we compared the effect of a
      low-dose 21-day combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 20 microg ethinyl
      estradiol (EE) and 75 microg gestodene (GTD) (Group A; n = 19) with an
      ultra-low-dose 24-day COC containing 15 microg EE and 60 microg GTD (Group B; n =
      18) on bone turnover and bone mineral density (BMD) in young, fertile women.
      Nineteen healthy fertile women were used as untreated controls (Group C). At 3,
      6, 9 and 12 months of the study serum osteocalcin (BGP), urinary pyridinoline
      (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (D-PYD) were measured in all subjects. At baseline
      and after 12 months BMD was determined at lumbar spine by dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry in all patients. In both Groups A and B, urinary levels of PYD and
      D-PYD at 6, 9 and 12 months, were significantly reduced in comparison with basal 
      values and with control subjects (p < 0.05). No significant differences in
      urinary PYD and D-PYD levels were observed between Groups A and B during the
      entire period of treatment. At 12 months, no statistically significant difference
      in spinal BMD values was detected between the three groups and in comparison with
      basal values. The present study suggests that the two COCs could exert a similar 
      positive effect on bone turnover in young postadolescent women, without any
      significant and appreciable modification of BMD.

TI  - Estradiol in premenstrual asthma: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      crossover study.
PG  - 561-71
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To characterize asthma symptoms and pulmonary function
      throughout two menstrual cycles, with and without exogenous estradiol
      administration, in women with premenstrual asthma, and to determine the effect of
      estradiol administration on asthma symptoms, pulmonary function, quality of life,
      and biomarkers of airway inflammation. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, crossover study. SETTING: Respiratory clinic and clinical
      research center. SUBJECTS: Twelve women with documented premenstrual asthma (> or
      = 20% premenstrual worsening of asthma symptoms and/or of peak expiratory flow
      [PEF] during a 1-month screening phase). INTERVENTION: Each woman received either
      estradiol 2 mg or placebo orally between cycle days 23 and 28 (i.e.,
      premenstrually, or before the onset of menses) in the first cycle and then
      crossed over to the other arm in the second cycle. Throughout both cycles, the
      women recorded daily morning and evening PEF readings and asthma symptoms.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Spirometry testing and measurement of serum
      estradiol and biomarkers of airway inflammation were performed on days 8
      (follicular phase), 22 (luteal phase), and 28 (premenstrually) of both the
      estradiol and placebo cycles. During the two premenstrual visits, the Asthma
      Quality of Life Questionnaire was administered. No notable differences were
      observed between the estradiol and placebo cycles in daily PEF recordings or
      composite asthma symptoms scores. The area under the curve (AUC) for the
      composite asthma symptoms versus time profile was numerically, but not
      statistically, lower (denoting less severe symptoms) during the estradiol cycle
      than during the placebo cycle. Likewise, no significant difference in AUC values 
      for morning PEF or evening PEF was found between the estradiol cycle and the
      placebo cycle. Despite differences (p<0.05) in day-28 estradiol concentrations
      for estradiol and placebo cycles, no significant differences were found in forced
      expiratory volume in 1 second, serum endothelin-1, serum and urine eosinophil
      protein X, urine leukotriene E4, or quality-of-life scores. CONCLUSION:
      Exogenously administered estradiol did not have a significant effect in women
      with premenstrual asthma whose asthma was classified predominantly as mild and
      under excellent control. As in the case of premenstrual syndrome, the placebo
      effect may be prominent in premenstrual asthma. Further trials, involving women
      with more severe asthma under poorer control, are warranted to discern underlying
      mechanisms for the worsening of asthma in relation to menstruation.

TI  - Long-term estrogen and hormone replacement therapy for the prevention and
      treatment of osteoporosis.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - Recent studies have called into question whether the risks of hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) outweigh its long-term benefits. There is a clear causal
      relationship between estrogen deficiency and osteoporosis. Postmenopausal status 
      or estrogen-deficiency at any age significantly increases a patient's risk for
      osteoporosis and subsequent fragility fractures. Estrogen, in various
      formulations, is currently FDA-indicated for the prevention of osteoporosis.
      However, estrogen is not FDA-approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. Recent
      randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that estrogen significantly reduces 
      fractures among osteoporotic postmenopausal women. Most postmenopausal women
      choose to use estrogen for relief of vasomotor symptoms and urogenital atrophy.
      HRT should be limited to osteoporosis prevention in women with significant
      ongoing vasomotor symptoms who are not at an increased risk for cardiovascular
      disease. An annual, individualized, risk/benefit reassessment should be performed
      on these patients. Further research is needed to assess the potential risks and
      benefits of various formulations, combinations, doses, and delivery routes of
      estrogen for postmenopausal women.

TI  - Increase of estrogen dose deteriorates mood during progestin phase in sequential 
      hormonal therapy.
PG  - 2026-30
AB  - Previous studies have indicated that the addition of progestins during sequential
      hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) causes negative mood and physical symptoms.
      History of premenstrual syndrome, type of progestin, and dose of progestin have
      thus far been shown to influence the progestin-induced adverse mood symptoms
      during HRT. The aim of this study was to compare adverse mood effects of two
      different doses of estradiol, in combination with a progestin, during
      postmenopausal HRT. Twenty-eight perimenopausal women were included in this
      randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing 2- or 3-mg continuous
      estradiol, with an addition of 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate on d 17-28
      during each treatment cycle. The main outcome measures were mood and physical
      symptoms kept on a daily rating scale. Together with the progestin, the higher
      dose of estrogen caused significantly more negative mood symptoms than the lower 
      dose. Tension, irritability, and depressed mood were all significantly augmented 
      during the progestin phase of cycles with 3 mg estradiol (P < 0.001). Physical
      symptoms also increased during the progestin phase of 3-mg estradiol cycles (P < 
      0.001), whereas positive mood symptoms were less affected. The only positive mood
      that changed with estrogen dose was friendliness, which decreased during the
      progestin phase of high estradiol cycles compared with cycles with lower
      estradiol (P < 0.05). Our conclusion is that an increase of the estrogen dose
      accentuates negative mood and physical symptoms during the progestin phase of
      sequential hormonal therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the effect on mood and the physical
      symptoms of two dosages of natural progesterone and a placebo in postmenopausal
      women with and without a history of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). DESIGN: A
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study was performed.
      METHOD: Postmenopausal women (n=36) with climacteric symptoms were recruited.
      They received 2 mg estradiol continuously during three 28-day cycles. Vaginal
      progesterone suppositories with 800 mg/day, 400 mg/day, or placebo were added
      sequentially for 14 days per cycle. Daily symptom ratings using a validated
      rating scale were kept. RESULTS: Women without a history of PMS showed cyclicity 
      in both negative mood and physical symptoms while on 400 mg/day progesterone but 
      not on the higher dose or the placebo. Women without a history of PMS had more
      physical symptoms on progesterone treatment compared with placebo. Women with
      prior PMS reported no progesterone-induced symptom cyclicity. CONCLUSION: In
      women without prior PMS natural progesterone caused negative mood effects similar
      to those induced by synthetic progestogens.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether the route of estrogen replacement therapy
      (ET) is the major determinant of C-reactive protein (CRP) in postmenopausal
      women. BACKGROUND: Recent studies demonstrated that oral ET causes a sustained
      increase in CRP, implicating a proinflammatory effect. Because CRP is synthesized
      in the liver, we hypothesized that estrogen-induced CRP elevation is related to
      first-pass hepatic metabolism. METHODS: In 21 postmenopausal women, we conducted 
      a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study to compare the effects of
      transdermal versus oral ET on CRP and inflammatory cytokines. We measured CRP,
      interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha before and after
      eight weeks of transdermal estradiol (E(2)) (100 microg/day), oral conjugated
      estrogen (CEE) (0.625 mg/day), or placebo. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), 
      a hepatic-derived anabolic peptide, was also measured. RESULTS: Transdermal E(2) 
      had no effect on CRP or IGF-1 levels. In contrast, eight weeks of oral conjugated
      estrogens caused a more than twofold increase in CRP and a significant reduction 
      in IGF-1 (p < 0.01) in the same women. The magnitude of increase in CRP was
      inversely correlated to the decrease in IGF-1 (r = -0.49, p = 0.008). Neither
      transdermal E(2) nor oral CEE had any effects on the plasma concentrations of
      cytokines that promote CRP synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women, oral 
      but not transdermal ET increased CRP by a first-pass hepatic effect. An increase 
      in CRP levels is accompanied by a reduction in IGF-1, an anti-inflammatory growth
      factor. Because CRP is a powerful predictor of an adverse prognosis in otherwise 
      healthy postmenopausal women, the route of administration may be an important
      consideration in minimizing the adverse effects of ET on cardiovascular outcomes.

TI  - Strontium ranelate: a new paradigm in the treatment of osteoporosis.
PG  - 89-101
AB  - Not one of the currently available medications has, so far, unequivocally
      demonstrated its ability to fully prevent the occurrence of new vertebral or
      peripheral osteoporotic fractures once osteoporosis is established. Therefore,
      several new therapies are currently under development to optimize the
      risk/benefit ratio of osteoporosis treatment. Strontium ranelate is composed of
      an organic moiety (ranelic acid) and of two atoms of stable nonradioactive
      strontium. In vitro, strontium ranelate increases collagen and noncollagenic
      proteins synthesis by mature osteoblast enriched cells. The effects of strontium 
      ranelate on bone formation were confirmed as strontium ranelate enhanced
      pre-osteoblastic cell replication. The stimulation by strontium ranelate of the
      replication of osteoprogenitor cell and collagen, as well as noncollagenic
      protein synthesis in osteoblasts, provides substantial evidence to categorize
      strontium ranelate as a bone-forming agent. In the isolated rat osteoclast assay,
      a pre-incubation of bone slices with strontium ranelate induced a dose- dependent
      inhibition of the bone resorbing activity of treated rat osteoclast. Strontium
      ranelate also dose-dependently inhibited, in a chicken bone marrow culture, the
      expression of both carbonic anhydrase II and the alpha-subunit of the vitronectin
      receptor. These effects showing that strontium ranelate significantly affects
      bone resorption due to a direct and/or matrix-mediated inhibition of osteoclast
      activity and also inhibits osteoclasts differentiation, are compatible with the
      profile of an anti-resorptive drug. In normal rats, administration of strontium
      ranelate induces an improvement in the mechanical properties of the humerus
      and/or the lumbar vertebra associated with a commensurate increase in bone
      dimension, shaft and volume. Strontium ranelate was administered in 160 early
      postmenopausal women, in a 24-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      prospective randomized study. Daily oral dose of 125 mg, 500 mg and 1 g of
      strontium ranelate were compared with a placebo. At the conclusion of the study, 
      the percent variation of lumbar-adjusted bone mineral density from baseline was
      significantly different in the group receiving 1 g/day of strontium ranelate
      compared with placebo (+1.41% vs. -0.98%, respectively). Increase in total hip
      and neck bone mineral density averages, respectively, 3.2% and 2.5%. Strontium
      ranelate does not induce any significant adverse reaction compared with those
      observed in women receiving a placebo for the same duration. In a phase II study,
      the effect of strontium ranelate in postmenopausal women with vertebral
      osteoporotic fractures was assessed during a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial. Doses of 500 mg, 1 g and 2 g daily of strontium ranelate or placebo were
      given to 353 Caucasian women with prevalent osteoporosis. At the conclusion of
      this 2-year study, the annual increase in lumbar-adjusted bone mineral density of
      the group receiving 2 g of strontium ranelate was + 2.97%. This result was
      significantly different compared with placebo. A significant increase in bone
      alkaline phosphatase and, over a 6-month period, a significant decrease in
      urinary-pyridium crosslinks (NTX) were evidenced. During the second year of
      treatment, the dose of 2 g was associated with a 44% reduction in the number of
      patients experiencing a new vertebral deformity. Bone histomorphometry showed no 
      mineralization defects. The same percentage of withdrawals following an adverse
      effect was observed for patients receiving placebo and for those receiving 2 g of
      strontium ranelate. The compound was further investigated in a large phase III
      program that included two extensive trials for the treatment of severe
      osteoporosis, one assessing the effects of strontium ranelate on the risk of
      vertebral fractures (SOTI) and one evaluating its effects on peripheral
      (nonspinal) fractures (TROPOS). The primary analysis of the SOTI study,
      evaluating the effect of 2 g of strontium ranelate on vertebral fracture rates,
      revealed a 41% reduction in the relative risk of expein the relative risk of
      experiencing a first new vertebral fracture with strontium ranelate, throughout
      the 3-year study, compared with placebo. The TROPOS study, showed a significant
      (p = 0.05) reduction in the relative risk of experiencing a first non-vertebral
      fracture in the group treated with strontium ranelate throughout the 3-year study
      compared with placebo in the intention-to-treat population. A 41% reduction in
      the relative risk of experiencing a hip fracture was demonstrated in the per
      protocol population. All these results imply that strontium ranelate is a new,
      effective and safe treatment for vertebral and nonvertebral osteoporosis, with a 
      unique mode of action.

TI  - Alendronate prevents loss of bone density associated with discontinuation of
      hormone replacement therapy: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 789-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many women using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) will discontinue
      HRT and lose its bone-protective effect. Methods to preserve bone density in
      these women need to be explored. This multicenter, international, randomized,
      blinded, 12-month study was conducted to assess the effect of alendronate sodium 
      on bone density in women who had recently discontinued HRT. METHODS: The 144
      postmenopausal women included in the study were diagnosed as having low bone
      mineral density (BMD) and had recently discontinued HRT. They were randomized to 
      receive either a daily dose of 10 mg of alendronate sodium or matching placebo.
      The main outcome measures were spine, hip, and total body BMD; biochemical
      markers of bone turnover; and tolerability. RESULTS: Alendronate treatment was
      associated with a 2.3% mean increase (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7%-3.0%) in
      spine BMD compared with a mean loss of 3.2% (95% CI, - 4.6% to - 1.7%) in
      patients receiving placebo, for a difference of 5.5% (95% CI, 4.2%-6.8%) between 
      alendronate and placebo. Greater hip and total body BMD preservation was also
      observed with alendronate use. Bone turnover decreased significantly with
      alendronate (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels decreased by 20% and
      urinary N-telopeptide/creatinine ratio by 47%), but increased in the placebo
      group (by 18% and 36%, respectively). Alendronate was well tolerated, with no
      increase in adverse events compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of
      bone loss was observed in the first 12 to 15 months after discontinuation of HRT 
      in postmenopausal women with low BMD. Treatment with alendronate increased or
      maintained both spine and hip BMD and prevented the increase in bone resorption
      seen with withdrawal of HRT in this population.

TI  - Aerobic exercise and bone mineral density in middle-aged finnish men: a
      controlled randomized trial with reference to androgen receptor, aromatase, and
      estrogen receptor alpha gene polymorphisms small star, filled.
PG  - 412-20
AB  - Our aim was to investigate associations of the polymorphic loci of androgen
      receptor (AR), aromatase CYP19, and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) genes with 
      bone mineral density (BMD) in a four-year controlled randomized exercise
      intervention trial in Finnish middle-aged men. Additionally, we studied whether
      the gene polymorphisms affect circulating testosterone (T), estradiol (E(2)), and
      sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations. The polymorphic CAG repeat of the AR
      gene, the TTTA repeat of the human aromatase gene, and the PvuII site of the
      ERalpha gene were analyzed. BMDs of the lumbar spine (L2-L4), femoral neck, and
      total proximal femur were measured with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
      In the exercise group, the subjects with the ERalpha gene PP or Pp genotypes
      showed an increase (+6.5 and +5.1%, respectively) in lumbar spine BMDs (P =
      0.007; repeated measures ANOVA) during intervention, while there was no change in
      the subjects with the pp genotype. The long TTTA repeat (TTTA(9-12)) in aromatase
      gene was associated with greater height (P = 0.026) and lower BMI (P = 0.029)
      values than the short TTTA repeat (TTTA(6-8)). With regard to the AR gene, no
      statistically significant differences in bone properties were found between the
      genotypes. There were no significant associations of any analyzed polymorphic
      sites with the serum sex steroid hormone concentrations in the exercise or
      reference group. In conclusion, the Finnish middle-aged men with ERalpha PP or Pp
      genotypes appear to have increased BMD values in the lumbar spine. This increase 
      may reflect a predisposition to age-related degenerative changes in the spine. In
      addition, the AR CAG repeat and aromatase TTTA repeat do not modify the effect of
      regular aerobic exercise on BMD.

TI  - Isoflavones and the prevention and treatment of prostate disease: is there a
      role?
PG  - 203-4, 206, 208-9 passim
AB  - Epidemiologic and experimental data suggest that isoflavones have benefits for
      preventing and treating some prostate disease. Isoflavone supplements may
      therefore be an important tool for men concerned about prostate disease, such as 
      those with benign prostatic hypertrophy undergoing watchful waiting or those
      concerned about the potential for prostate cancer. Conclusive proof of a
      relationship between isoflavones and the prevention and treatment of prostate
      disease can only come from prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials.

TI  - A common methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (C677T) polymorphism is associated
      with low bone mineral density and increased fracture incidence after menopause:
      longitudinal data from the Danish osteoporosis prevention study.
PG  - 723-9
AB  - A polymorphism in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)
      has recently been associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal
      Japanese women. It is not known whether this effect is also present in European
      populations and whether it is caused by lower peak bone mass or accelerated
      postmenopausal bone loss. MTHFR genotyping was done in 1748 healthy
      postmenopausal Danish women participating in a prospective study of risk factors 
      for osteoporosis. At the time of enrollment, 3-24 months after last menstrual
      period, the less prevalent genotype (TT, 8.7% of the population) was associated
      with significantly lower BMD at the femoral neck (ANOVA, p < 0.05), total hip (p 
      < 0.01), and spine (p < 0.05 adjusted for lifestyle covariates, p = 0.06 without 
      adjustment). The mean difference was between 0.1 and 0.3 SD, depending on
      measurement site. MTHFR genotype added significantly to prediction of BMD by
      weight and age. Fracture incidence was increased more than 2-fold in subjects
      with the TT genotype (risk ratio [RR], 2.6; 95% CI 1.2-5.6). This remained
      significant when the Cox analysis was controlled for BMD (RR, 2.4; 95% CI
      1.1-5.2). No differences in serum osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline
      phosphatase, and 25-OH-vitamin D were found between genotypes. The response to
      hormone replacement therapy (HRT) did not differ, but the association of the TT
      genotype with reduced BMD was maintained at the total hip after 5 years of HRT.
      The MTHFR TT genotype is associated with low BMD and increased fracture incidence
      in early postmenopausal women.

TI  - Postmenopausal hormone therapy: cardiovascular risks.
PG  - 65-9
AB  - (1) The WHI study was published in 2002: a randomised double-blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trial in more than 16 000 women with an average age
      of 63 years at enrollment. The paper reports data on the long-term adverse
      effects of combined equine estrogen-progestin hormone replacement therapy, taken 
      for 5 years. (2) On average, a yearly excess of 19 severe adverse events per 10
      000 women occurred in the estrogen-progestin group. Relative to the placebo
      group, there were an extra 8 pulmonary embolisms, 7 coronary events, 8 strokes
      and 8 cases of invasive breast cancer. In contrast, there were 6 fewer colorectal
      cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures in the active treatment group. (3) The
      differences in the frequency of coronary events and venous thromboembolism
      emerged after the first year of treatment, while the curves for stroke and breast
      cancer diverged after the second and fifth years, respectively. (4) The overall
      mortality rate did not differ between the two groups. (5) A placebo-controlled
      trial of the same hormone combination (HERS trial), given for 4.1 years as
      secondary prophylaxis against coronary heart disease was published in 1998. The
      drug was ineffective during the trial, and during unblinded post-trial follow-up 
      of 2 321 women for an average of 2.7 years (HERS II study). (6) The
      estrogen-progestin combination used in these trials did not reduce the risk of
      coronary heart disease (in primary or secondary prophylaxis) or the risk of
      stroke. On the contrary, both risks increased. (7) The increased incidence of
      deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism associated with
      estrogen-progestin replacement therapy was confirmed in these trials, even among 
      women with no relevant history. (8) The WHI trial also confirmed the increased
      risk of breast cancer in women on hormone replacement therapy, but did not study 
      its impact on outcome or mortality. (9) The WHI trial confirmed the beneficial
      impact of estrogen-progestin combination therapy on the risk of osteoporotic
      fracture. An average of 5 hip fractures were avoided each year per 10 000 women
      treated (10 versus 15 observed cases per 10 000 women per year), together with 6 
      symptomatic vertebral fractures (9 versus 15 cases) and 44 osteoporotic fractures
      (147 versus 191 cases). It is not known whether the benefit observed at the end
      of the trial persisted after the end of treatment. (10) In practice, the decision
      to prescribe hormone replacement therapy, and the optimal duration of treatment, 
      must be weighed up according to each individual's risk factors. And the decision 
      to treat or not to treat must be regularly re-assessed. Women must be informed of
      the potential risks and benefits, and must be monitored. They should also be
      advised not to use less well assessed treatments such as phytoestrogens, DHEA and
      tibolone. (11) Health authorities, especially in Europe, must organise
      comparative trials to assess the benefits and risks of other hormone combinations
      used by perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

TI  - Controlled high meat diets do not affect calcium retention or indices of bone
      status in healthy postmenopausal women.
PG  - 1020-6
AB  - Calcium balance is decreased by an increased intake of purified proteins,
      although the effects of common dietary sources of protein (like meat) on calcium 
      economy remain controversial. We compared the effects of several weeks of
      controlled high and low meat diets on body calcium retention, using sensitive
      radiotracer and whole body scintillation counting methodology. Healthy
      postmenopausal women (n = 15) consumed diets with similar calcium content
      (approximately 600 mg), but either low or high in meat (12 vs. 20% of energy as
      protein) for 8 wk each, in a randomized crossover design. After 4 wk of
      equilibration of each diet, calcium retention was measured by extrinsically
      labeling the 2-d menu with (47)Ca, followed by whole body scintillation counting 
      for 28 d. Urinary and blood indicators of bone metabolism were also determined
      for each diet. Calcium retention was not different during the high and low meat
      dietary periods (d 28, mean +/- pooled SD: 17.1 and 15.6%, +/-0.6%, respectively;
      P = 0.09). An initially higher renal acid excretion in subjects consuming the
      high meat compared with the low meat diet decreased significantly with time. The 
      diets did not affect urinary calcium loss or indicators of bone metabolism. In
      conclusion, under controlled conditions, a high meat compared with a low meat
      diet for 8 wk did not affect calcium retention or biomarkers of bone metabolism
      in healthy postmenopausal women. Calcium retention is not reduced when subjects
      consume a high protein diet from common dietary sources such as meat.

TI  - Bone density changes with once weekly risedronate in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - Risedronate 5 mg daily is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat
      postmenopausal osteoporosis. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common with daily
      bisphosphonates, but recent studies show that once weekly treatment may be better
      tolerated. Risedronate 30 mg is approved to treat Paget s disease of bone. In
      this retrospective study, we assessed the GI tolerability of 30 mg of risedronate
      once weekly and evaluated the effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in a subset of
      women. Review of patients treated in our osteoporosis clinic identified 150
      postmenopausal women with low BMD treated with 30 mg of risedronate once weekly, 
      between February 1998 and March 2001. Baseline GI symptoms or previous
      intolerance of bisphosphonates was present in 32 patients. An additional
      antiresorptive treatment was continued with risedronate in 50% of these patients 
      (estrogen, raloxifene, or calcitonin). Risedronate 30 mg was taken once weekly
      with vitamin D 400 iu daily and 1200 mg of calcium daily. Patient age ranged from
      46 to 86 yr. Baseline and followup BMD data were available in 36 patients. Of the
      32 patients with baseline GI symptoms or previous intolerance of a
      bisphosphonate, 1 developed GI symptoms. In those patients with baseline and
      follow-up BMD results (n = 36), BMD increased 1.9% (p = 0.02) at the trochanter
      and 2.1% (p = 0.001) at the total hip. In conclusion 30 mg of risedronate once
      weekly increased BMD at the trochanter and total hip (p < 0.05). This dosage was 
      well tolerated with a low incidence of GI side effects.

TI  - Physician treatment of osteoporosis in response to heel ultrasound bone mineral
      density reports.
PG  - 375-81
AB  - Optimal information that should be included in ultrasound (US) heel bone mineral 
      density (BMD) reports is not known. If additional information about further
      evaluation of patients with low heel BMD were included in reports, would
      responses for treatment improve? We screened people at health fairs using the
      Sahara heel US machine. For those with a T-score of </= 1.0, letters were sent to
      their primary care physician notifying them of the result. Physicians were
      randomly assigned to (1) a standard letter, which recommended central bone
      density screening (dual X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) and treatment if the BMD was 
      low; or (2) an extended letter, which also outlined treatment strategies based on
      recommended subsequent central DXA scan results for a T-score of < 1.50 and also 
      if < 2.00. The extended letter only increased the frequency of DXA testing from
      30.1 to 37.2% (not a significant increase). Of 88 people with heel BMD </= 1.00
      and not previously on any treatment, 25 of 45 (56%) were treated (calcium,
      estrogens, bisphosphonates, or calcitonin or a combination) after physicians
      received a standard letter and 30 of 43 (70%) after an extended letter (one-sided
      p = 0.084). Of people with T </= 1.9, and initially taking nothing more than
      calcium, 5 of 36 (13.9%) received additional treatment after physicians received 
      a standard letter vs 9 of 41 (22.0%) after an extended letter (one-sided p =
      0.180). For those with T </= 1.0 because of the screen 25 of 197 (12.7%) received
      additional treatment. One hundred forty-six of 194 (75%) individuals and received
      treatment with calcium or other medications, and 74 of 173 (43%) of individuals
      before screening and 141 of 195 (72%) after physicians received letters took
      calcium. Physicians regarded calcium alone as adequate treatment in many cases.
      There was no marked increase in treatment when additional information was
      provided to physicians regarding evaluation and treatment for low US heel BMD
      results.

TI  - Moclobemide in the treatment of hot flashes in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 258-65
AB  - This randomized, prospective, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and
      tolerability of moclobemide, a reversible, selective inhibitor of monoamine
      oxidase-A, in reducing the frequency and severity of hot flashes. Thirty
      postmenopausal women were enrolled, and 28 were allocated to 5 weeks of treatment
      with moclobemide 150 mg (group 1, n = 10), moclobemide 300 mg (group 2, n = 11), 
      or placebo (group 3, n = 9). Data on hot flashes were recorded in a daily diary. 
      Mean reductions in the hot flash severity score were 24.4% in the placebo group, 
      69.8% in group 1, and 35.0% in group 2. This large difference suggests that the
      beneficial effects were not due to a placebo effect. Moclobemide may be a new
      nonhormonal option for reducing the incidence, severity, and duration of hot
      flashes in postmenopausal women who do not wish to take estrogen or have
      contraindications to its use.

TI  - Evaluation of a unique oral contraceptive (Yasmin) in the management of
      premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
PG  - 27-34; discussion 42-3
AB  - Over three-quarters of women experience some physical and emotional changes
      associated with the menstrual cycle. Irritability, tension, fatigue, depression, 
      breast tenderness and bloating are among the most common premenstrual symptoms.
      Approximately 5-10% of women of childbearing age experience premenstrual symptoms
      to a degree that disrupts their functioning in the home or workplace and that
      meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Serotonergic
      antidepressants are clearly effective for PMDD, with about 60% of subjects
      responding to this treatment in controlled studies. Oral contraceptives are
      commonly used to treat premenstrual symptoms but are an understudied intervention
      with no information on their efficacy for PMDD). The recent introduction of an
      oral contraceptive (Yasmin, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany), containing low-dose
      ethinylestradiol (EE) combined with a new progestogen, drospirenone (DRSP), may
      offer clinical efficacy for PMDD as a result of the unique pharmacological
      profile of this progestogen, which is a spirolactone derivative with
      antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity. A randomized,
      placebo-controlled study of DRSP/EE in women with PMDD found a consistently
      greater reduction of symptoms-from baseline for all 22 premenstrual symptoms
      assessed (using the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences, COPE) and for the four 
      statistically derived symptom factors in the group taking DRSP/EE compared to the
      placebo group. For appetite, acne and food craving (factor 3), the difference
      between the DRSP/EE group and the placebo group was statistically significant (p 
      = 0.027). These preliminary results suggest the beneficial effect of DRSP/EE on
      PMDD and offer an alternative class of medication that also provides the range of
      benefits of oral contraception for women with PMDD.

TI  - Medical oophorectomy with and without estrogen add-back therapy in the prevention
      of migraine headache.
PG  - 309-21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the preventive benefit of "medical oophorectomy" and
      transdermal estradiol in women with migraine. BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies
      have demonstrated that declines in serum estrogen levels occurring during normal 
      menstrual cycles can trigger headache in women with migraine. Prior to this
      study, no randomized controlled trials have evaluated whether minimizing these
      hormonal changes pharmacologically can prevent headache. METHODS: Twenty-one
      women with regular menstrual cycles and a diagnosis of migraine headache were
      enrolled. After a 2.5-month placebo run-in phase, all patients received a
      subcutaneous goserelin implant (a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist) to
      induce a medical oophorectomy. One month later, while continuing goserelin,
      participants were randomized to receive a transdermal patch containing 100 microg
      of estradiol-17beta (gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/estradiol group, n = 
      9) or a placebo patch (gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/placebo group, n = 
      12) during a 2-month treatment phase. The primary outcome measure was the
      headache index, which was defined as the mean of pain severity ratings (0 to 10
      scale) recorded three times per day by daily diary. Secondary outcome measures
      included headache disability, headache severity, headache frequency, and the
      percentage of headaches with a pain severity rating of 7 or greater. RESULTS: The
      headache index was significantly lower during the treatment period in the
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/estradiol group than in the
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/placebo group (P =.025). Similar
      improvements were observed in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      agonist/estradiol group for all secondary outcome measures with the exception of 
      headache frequency, which was unchanged between the groups. Within the
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/estradiol group, there was a 33.7%
      reduction (95% confidence interval, -64.4 to -3.0) in the headache index during
      the treatment phase when compared with the placebo run-in phase; no difference
      was seen between those phases within the gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      agonist/placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Minimization of hormonal fluctuations with
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy alone is inadequate to prevent
      headache in women who are premenopausal with migraine. The addition of
      transdermal estradiol to existing gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy 
      provides a modest preventive benefit.

TI  - A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the dose effect of oral
      oestradiol on menopausal symptoms, psychological well being, and quality of life 
      in postmenopausal Chinese women.
PG  - 207-14
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypoestrogenism occurring in association with the menopause may
      result in the development of vasomotor symptoms and it may also have a
      detrimental effect on psychological well being and quality of life (QOL). The
      aims of this study were to measure menopausal symptoms, mood and QOL in
      postmenopausal Chinese women and to assess the effect of different doses of
      oestrogen on these outcome indicators. METHODS: A prospective, randomized,
      placebo-controlled study of the effect of 1 and 2 mg oestradiol on menopausal
      symptoms, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and QOL in 152 postmenopausal women
      over a 12 month study period. Menopausal symptoms were measured using a modified 
      Kupperman's scale. Anxiety and depressive symptoms and QOL were measured using
      the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales and a modification of the World Health
      Organization Quality of Life questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: Baseline
      scoring of vasomotor symptoms in our population was low whilst QOL scoring was
      relatively high. Over 12 months, after adjustment for differences in baseline
      scoring, there was a significant reduction in menopausal symptom scores in the 2 
      mg oestradiol group compared with placebo but not in the 1 mg group. There were
      no statistically significant changes in levels of anxiety and depression or QOL
      in either the 1 or the 2 mg group compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that relatively few Chinese women will be expected to benefit
      from hormone replacement in terms of either QOL or mood. In addition, the overall
      benefit of treatment for vasomotor symptoms will be less for a given number of
      Chinese women than for Caucasians. Therefore, when considering the reasons for
      prescribing hormone replacement therapy in this population, protection against
      osteoporosis will for most women be the prime consideration.

TI  - Failure of tibolone to potentiate the pharmacological effect of fluoxetine in
      postmenopausal major depression.
PG  - 33-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perimenopausal depression has been attributed to physiological
      progressive estrogen decline. Estrogen and derivatives have some mood-enhancing
      effects, although studies of using estrogen as an antidepressant have had mixed
      results. The gonadomimetic drug tibolone stimulates estrogen receptors in a
      tissue-selective fashion, increasing the gonadal activity without causing some of
      the usual side effects of other estrogen preparations. METHODS: A total of 31
      postmenopausal outpatients with a major depressive disorder (MDD) participated in
      the study. Sixteen received the antidepressant fluoxetine (20 mg/day) plus
      tibolone (2.5 mg/day), and 15 received the same dose of fluoxetine plus placebo, 
      assigned in a randomized fashion. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, the two
      groups had a similar level of improvement in their depressive symptoms. Both
      treatments were well tolerated, without significant side effects. Pretreatment
      and posttreatment serum hormonal levels did not predict the final response.
      CONCLUSIONS: Combining tibolone and fluoxetine did not represent a more robust
      antidepressant response than fluoxetine alone in postmenopausal women with MDD.

TI  - Measurement of steroid levels in saliva in a population-based survey of
      lifestyle, medical conditions, marriage, sex life and hormone status in aging
      men: a feasibility study.
PG  - 203-15
AB  - Some population-based studies on male aging measure testosterone and cortisol in 
      saliva instead of serum, but very few measure estradiol and
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), suggesting further testing is needed for
      reliability and comparative validity. In addition, the effects of interview
      stress and circadian hormone secretion need to be checked. In a pilot study on
      the overall sexual capacity of aging men, 48 randomly selected, healthy,
      heterosexual, cohabiting men aged 50-80 years, from Mannheim, Germany, and 50
      from the State College, Pennsylvania, USA, were administered a standardized
      interview covering medical biography, present and previous life and work,
      marriage and emotional status. Two saliva samples were collected from each
      subject for measurement of testosterone, cortisol, estradiol and DHEA-S levels
      before and after the interview, and each subject completed a confidential
      self-administered questionnaire on intercourse, masturbation, orgasm, fantasies, 
      libido and arousal. Questionnaires, hormone measurement techniques and the survey
      protocol had been extensively pretested. Prior to the pilot study, the kits for
      measuring testosterone and DHEA-S in saliva were checked for comparative validity
      against established measuring techniques in serum in 31 cases for testosterone
      and in 24 different cases for DHEA-S. These 55 cases underwent clinical diagnosis
      and were not otherwise involved in this study. The cases had been referred to the
      Andrology Unit of the University Hospital, Marburg, for reasons unrelated to this
      study. Given the biological differences for both steroids between their presence 
      in blood and in saliva, a perfect correspondence between the two values was not
      expected and was not observed. The correlations obtained, however, support the
      assumption that all statistical relationships between testosterone and DHEA-S
      values in serum and clinical, as well as behavioral, variables reported to date
      may be replicated for testosterone and DHEA-S values in saliva.

TI  - Effects of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and estrogen
      administration on IGF-I, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-2, and IGFBP-3 in anorexia
      nervosa: a randomized-controlled study.
PG  - 1142-9
AB  - Administration of recombinant human (rh) IGF-I has been shown to have positive
      effects on bone density in anorexia nervosa, but the effects of rhIGF-I and
      estrogen on IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-2 and IGFBP-3 in anorexia nervosa are not
      known. Sixty-five osteopenic women with anorexia nervosa were randomized to
      rhIGF-I (30 micro g/kg sc twice daily) alone (n = 15), daily ethinyl estradiol
      (Ovcon 35) with rhIGF-I (n = 15), estradiol and placebo (n = 15), or placebo (n =
      14) for 9 months. Subjects were 25.6 +/- 0.8 yr of age, low weight (body mass
      index 16.6 +/- 0.2 kg/m(2)) and osteopenic (T scores -2.06 +/- 0.09 for spine and
      -1.76 +/- 0.13 for hip). IGFBP-3 correlated with total hip bone density (r =
      0.47, P = 0.0002) and was a significant predictor of hip bone density (P = 0.010)
      independent of IGF-I and body mass index in a multivariate regression model.
      During therapy, IGFBP-2 increased by 48 +/- 19 ng/ml in response to rhIGF-I and
      decreased by -38 +/- 22 ng/ml in response to placebo (P = 0.011). IGFBP-3
      decreased (-895 +/- 120 ng/ml) in response to rhIGF-I but showed a minimal change
      (-53 +/- 99 ng/ml) in response to placebo (P < 0.0001). In contrast, no
      significant effect of estrogen was seen on IGF-I, IGFBP-2 or IGFBP-3. Among
      patients receiving rhIGF-I, the change in IGFBP-2 was inversely associated with
      the change in total hip bone density (R = -0.47, P = 0.013). In conclusion, our
      data suggest that chronic rhIGF-I administration increases IGF-I and IGFBP-2 and 
      decreases IGFBP-3 in women with anorexia nervosa. IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 may be
      important determinants of bone density in this population.

TI  - Soy protein and isoflavone effects on vasomotor symptoms in peri- and
      postmenopausal women: the Soy Estrogen Alternative Study.
PG  - 147-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of dietary soy proteins containing
      differing amounts of isoflavones on the number and severity of vasomotor symptoms
      (hot flashes and night sweats) in peri- and postmenopausal women. DESIGN: A
      double-masked, randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted. A total of
      241 community-dwelling women reporting vasomotor symptoms at baseline were
      randomized into one of three groups. In all groups, participants consumed a daily
      supplement containing 25 g of soy protein and were randomly assigned to one of
      three groups: (a) isoflavone extracted soy protein (control), (b) soy protein
      with a medium dose of isoflavones (42 mg/day), or (c) soy protein with a higher
      dose of isoflavones (58 mg/day). The primary outcome measure in this trial was
      change in reported vasomotor symptoms. RESULTS: A reduction in the number and
      severity of vasomotor symptoms was observed in all three treatment groups. No
      significant differences in the number and severity of vasomotor symptoms were
      observed among the high isoflavone, middle isoflavone, or control groups. The
      lack of a between-treatment group effect was observed even after stratified by
      number of baseline symptoms and use of traditional hormone replacement therapy.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that soy protein containing 42 or 58 mg of
      isoflavones is no more effective than isoflavone-extracted soy protein for
      improving the number and severity of vasomotor symptoms in peri- and
      postmenopausal women.

TI  - Differing effects of low-dose estrogen-progestin therapy and pravastatin in
      postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women.
PG  - 341-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies examining the potential cardioprotective effects of
      postmenopausal estrogen have been undertaken in healthy women, with doses that
      may not be appropriate for long-term intervention. New low-dose
      estrogen-progestin regimens alleviate postmenopausal symptoms with a favorable
      side-effect profile; however, little is known of the impact of such regimens in
      women at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Hence, we have evaluated the
      effects of low-dose oral estrogen-progestin therapy on serum lipoprotein lipids, 
      brachial artery reactivity and fibrinogen in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal 
      women in direct comparison with the effects of pravastatin, a lipid-lowering
      agent known to reduce cardiovascular events in women. METHODS: In a randomized,
      double-blind, double-dummy, parallel trial, we studied the effects of continuous 
      combined estrogen-progestin therapy (1 mg 17beta-estradiol with 500 micro g
      norethisterone acetate daily) or pravastatin (20 mg daily) in 72 postmenopausal
      women with fasting serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels greater
      than 124 mg/dl after an 8-week run-in diet, over a 24-week period. The primary
      end-point was percentage change in LDL cholesterol from baseline. RESULTS: The
      intention-to-treat population comprised 65 women, mean age 59 +/- 6.3 years, and 
      29 in each group completed the trial. Diet alone reduced LDL cholesterol
      significantly in both treatment groups, in association with a reduction in weight
      during this period. Compared with respective baseline values, pravastatin
      decreased LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol to a greater extent than hormone 
      therapy (p = 0.0001 and 0.003 for difference between treatments, respectively).
      High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels decreased with hormone therapy,
      but did not change with pravastatin (p = 0.01). Lipoprotein(a) decreased
      significantly with hormone therapy only (-14%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21
      to -6%, p = 0.01 for difference between groups). Brachial artery flow-mediated
      dilatation (FMD) was impaired at baseline, and this increased with hormone
      therapy (absolute mean change in artery diameter as percentage units 2.07, 95% CI
      0.57-3.57, p = 0.009) versus no change with pravastatin (0.19, 95% CI -1.1 to
      1.5, p = 0.78), with a near-significant difference between the two groups (p =
      0.058). A significant correlation between improved brachial artery FMD and
      reduction in LDL cholesterol was not observed. Fibrinogen decreased significantly
      in both treatment groups with no difference between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: In
      postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women, pravastatin and hormone therapy
      exhibited divergent effects. The former lowered total and LDL cholesterol more
      effectively, whereas hormone therapy lowered lipoprotein(a) significantly and
      improved brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilatation, independent of the
      reduction in LDL cholesterol. The modest increase in brachial artery FMD seen is 
      consistent with hypercholesterolemia compromising endothelial integrity, and
      suggests that the important effect of estrogen on the endothelial
      microenvironment may be attenuated in women with endothelial dysfunction.

TI  - Vaginal estrogen preparations: a review of safety and efficacy for vaginal
      atrophy.
PG  - 857-77
AB  - BACKGROUND: A theoretical advantage of local (i.e., vaginal) therapy of
      genitourinary symptoms could be avoidance of systemic adverse effects. Review of 
      efficacy and adverse effects of commonly prescribed vaginal estrogens is of great
      clinical relevance. METHODS: A Medline (1966-present) search was performed for
      randomized controlled trials involving vaginal estrogens. Reference lists of
      papers were reviewed for additional references. RESULTS: Twenty-two references
      were randomized controlled trials of vaginal estrogens used by postmenopausal
      women with signs or symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Subject numbers ranged from 20
      to 251. Duration ranged from 2 weeks to 1 year. Different preparations and
      schedules were used across the trials. All treatments alleviated signs and
      symptoms of atrophic vaginitis, regardless of whether objective signs of atrophy 
      were required for study entry. Data for urinary symptoms was conflicting; the
      ring may prevent recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The trials with
      endometrial scrutiny were less than one year and had mixed results. Nonhormonal
      lubricant is effective in improving some atrophic signs and symptoms. All
      preparations were associated with vaginal irritation. Bleeding with vaginal
      estradiol tablets may be less than that with CEE cream. Vaginal tablets or rings 
      were preferred over other preparations. There were no serious adverse events
      reported. There was occasional expulsion of estradiol ring in the setting of
      prior hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS: All preparations are effective in decreasing
      signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy, but they differ slightly in their adverse 
      event profiles. Long-term safety of the preparations is best established for
      estradiol tablets (1 year), but is lacking for all preparations.

TI  - Percutaneous estrogen in prevention of early postmenopausal bone loss in Chinese 
      women.
PG  - 1790-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the optimal dosage of 17beta-estradiol gel + oral
      progestin for preventing bone loss in postmenopausal Chinese women. METHODS: A
      3-year open label, randomized, prospective clinical trial was conducted. Sixty
      healthy women who had been postmenopausal for 1 to 5 years were recruited and
      divided into following 4 groups: group 1, percutaneous gel 17beta-estradiol
      (E(2)) 1.5 mg/d plus micronized progesterone (MP) 100 mg/d; group 2, percutaneous
      gel 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) 1.5 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2
      mg/d; group 3, percutaneous gel 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) 0.75 mg/d plus micronized
      progesterone (MP) 100 mg/d; and group 4, percutaneous gel 17beta-estradiol (E(2))
      0.75 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2 mg/d. Estrogen and progestin
      were given continuously for 25 days per month. Bone mineral density (BMD) was
      measured using quantitative computed tomography (QCT) for trabecular bone of L2-5
      and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for L2-4 and hip 5 times during the
      trial at baseline and at the 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 36-month visits. RESULTS:
      Fifty-nine patients (98.3%, 59/60) stayed in the study for 1 year, 56 patients
      (93.3%, 56/60) for 2 years, and 51 (85%, 51/50) for 3 years. On average,
      menopausal symptoms were relieved by 80% after 6 months of treatment. By the 24th
      month, the mean increase in BMD ranged from 4.3% to 7.5% in trabecular bone; and 
      by the 36th month, it ranged from 4.2% to 6.2% in L2-4 and 1.61% to 3.77% in the 
      neck. There were significant difference after treatment (P < 0.05). Among the
      four groups, no significant difference (P > 0.05) was found in improvement of
      symptoms, levels of bone markers or BMD. CONCLUSION: A daily dose of estradiol
      gel, either 0.75 mg or 1.5 mg, is effective in preventing early postmenopausal
      bone loss and relieving menopausal symptoms. After 3-year treatment, spinal BMD
      could increase steadily, so does hip BMD, especially in the first 2 years.

TI  - 17beta-estradiol reduces plasma Abeta40 for HRT-naive postmenopausal women with
      Alzheimer disease: a preliminary study.
PG  - 239-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: One mechanism to support the potentially beneficial effects of
      estrogen in the brain for postmenopausal women potentially involves the hormone's
      ability to favorably alter the processing of amyloid-precursor protein (APP),
      believed to play an important role in the pathobiology of Alzheimer disease (AD).
      The authors evaluated the effects of estrogen administration on plasma
      concentration of one by-product of APP processing, Abeta40, for postmenopausal
      women with AD. METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel-group
      design study, 20 women were randomized to receive either 0.10 mg/day of
      transdermal 17beta-estradiol or a placebo for 8 weeks and were retrospectively
      evaluated as to whether basal levels of Abeta40 were affected by pre-study use of
      hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Blood samples were collected and cognitive
      tests were administered at baseline; at Weeks 3, 5, and 8 during treatment; and
      again 8 weeks after treatment termination. RESULTS: For the group as a whole,
      plasma Abeta40 was not reliably reduced in response to short-term estradiol
      administration. For HRT-naive subjects, baseline Abeta40 concentrations were
      higher than those of previous HRT users, and controlled estradiol administration 
      significantly reduced plasma Abeta40 by the end of the 8-week treatment period.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results provide preliminary clinical evidence to support an
      effect of estradiol on Abeta-processing for AD women who are HRT-naive. This
      finding suggests that the hormone may serve as an Abeta-lowering agent for
      HRT-naive AD women, which may, in turn, have ultimate ramifications for the
      progression of AD pathology.

      of randomised controlled trials.
PG  - 217-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of
      computer-generated medication reminders or feedback directed to healthcare
      providers or patients. DATA SOURCES: Extensive computerised and manual literature
      searches identified 76 English-language reports of RCTs reported before 1 January
      2002. Searches were conducted between June 1998 and April 2002. STUDY SELECTION: 
      26 papers making 29 comparisons (two papers reported on multiple interventions)
      of computer-supported medication management to a control group. DATA EXTRACTION: 
      The quality of the RCTs was systematically assessed and scored independently by
      two reviewers. Rates of compliance with (potential) reminders for the control and
      intervention groups were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Heterogeneity of studies
      prevented a meta-analysis. Where possible, rates were calculated using the
      intention-to-treat principle. The comparisons were grouped into five areas.
      Reminders to providers in outpatient settings: six of 12 comparisons demonstrated
      positive effects (relative rates [RRs: intervention rates/control rates], 1.0 to 
      42.0). Provider feedback in outpatient settings: five of seven comparisons showed
      improved clinician behaviour (RRs, 1.0 to 2.5). Combined reminders and feedback
      in outpatient settings: the single comparison found no improvement. Reminders to 
      providers in inpatient settings: three of five comparisons showed improvements
      (RRs, 1.0 to 2.1). Patient-directed reminders: two of four comparisons showed
      improvements in patient compliance. CONCLUSION: Reminders are more effective than
      feedback in modifying physician behaviour related to medication management.
      Patient-directed reminders can improve medication adherence.

TI  - Role of androgens in mild cognitive impairment and possible interventions during 
      andropause.
PG  - 448-52
AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is becoming fashionable as a diagnosis,
      representing a state of cognitive decline associated with negligible functional
      loss. MCI is important as it often precedes Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recognizing
      MCI may lead to preventive strategies that can delay the onset of AD. Many
      patients who transition into andropause report problems with their memory. There 
      is strong evidence from basic sciences and epidemiological studies that both
      estrogens and androgens play a protective role in neurodegeneration. The evidence
      from small prospective clinical trials lends support to the role of hormones in
      improving cognitive function. The improvement in cognitive function with hormones
      is subtle and often not measurable on standard neuropsychological batteries.
      Patients have reported memory improvements in both declarative and procedural
      domains after being on hormonal replacement. Functional changes and vascular
      changes can be detected after hormonal replacement with more sophisticated
      imaging of the brain like positron emission tomography (PET) scans. We
      hypothesize androgens and perhaps selective androgen receptor modulators as
      future treatment options for MCI in aging males.

TI  - Estrogen levels do not correlate with improvement in cognition.
PG  - 209-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an association exists between estradiol and
      estrone levels and measures of cognitive functioning in women with Alzheimer
      disease (AD) treated with conjugated equine estrogen (Premarin; Wyeth-Ayerst,
      Philadelphia, Pa). METHODS: We studied 120 postmenopausal women who underwent
      hysterectomy and who had AD treated with Premarin for 1 year. Plasma estradiol
      and estrone levels were determined at multiple points during the 1-year treatment
      trial. The change from baseline level at 2 and 12 months was associated with the 
      change score on 7 different assessments of cognitive functioning. RESULTS: At
      baseline, estradiol levels were low and there were no associations between the
      estradiol level and the 7 neuropsychological measures. A similar pattern was
      observed for estrone treatment. During treatment with 0.625 mg/d of Premarin,
      estradiol levels increased about 4-fold; while receiving 1.25 mg/d of Premarin,
      estradiol levels increased about 8-fold. A similar pattern was seen with estrone 
      treatment. For both estradiol and estrone levels, there were no significant
      associations between the change in plasma level and the change in
      neuropsychological test scores at either 2 or 12 months. CONCLUSION: Although
      Premarin elevated estradiol and estrone levels, there was no association between 
      hormone levels and cognitive functioning after either 2 or 12 months of
      treatment.

TI  - Effects of hormone replacement therapy on perceptual and cognitive event-related 
      potentials in menopausal insomnia.
PG  - 419-45
AB  - The influence of a combined estrogen-progestin regimen (Climodien, Lafamme) on
      auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) was investigated in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, comparative, randomized 3-arm trial phase (Climodien
      2/3=estradiol valerate 2 mg+the progestin dienogest 3 mg, EV=estradiol valerate 2
      mg, and placebo), followed by an open-label phase in which all patients received 
      Climodien 2/2 (estradiol valerate 2 mg+dienogest 2 mg). Both the double-blind and
      the open-label phase lasted 2 months. ERPs were recorded from 19 EEG leads in a
      two-tone odd-ball paradigm in 49 patients aged between 46 and 67 yr with the
      diagnosis of insomnia (G 47.0) related to postmenopausal syndrome (N 95.1).
      Climodien reduced standard N1 and target P300 latencies as compared to placebo,
      while EV did not affect N1 latency but similarly reduced P300 latency. Climodien 
      increased N1, P2 and P300 amplitudes dose-dependently, predominantly at frontal
      leads. Estrogen alone had only minor effects on ERP amplitudes. The shortening of
      standard N1 latency and enhancement of N1 and P2 amplitudes indicates a positive 
      effect of Climodien on perceptual processing, most likely due to vigilance
      improvements also observed in EEG mapping. Concerning target P300, it seems that 
      estradiol is responsible for the improvement in stimulus evaluation time, as
      reflected by the shortening of the peak latency, while dienogest seems to account
      for the improvement in cognitive information processing capacity, whereby 3 mg
      induced a more pronounced augmentation of P300 amplitudes than 2 mg. Based on the
      spatial distribution of this increase, it can be speculated that Climodien mainly
      affects the more frontally distributed P3a subcomponent, which is associated with
      attention and orientation. Furthermore, the observed changes in ERP-components
      are consistent with recent studies showing significant positive effects of
      hormone replacement therapy on cholinergic functions. Thus, Climodien seems to be
      of interest in preventing cognitive decline and treating cognitive disorders in
      postmenopausal women. Indeed, there is increasing evidence of beneficial effects 
      of estrogen in dementia. Our present findings suggest that the estrogen effects
      may be augmented by dienogest.

TI  - On the role of menopause for sleep-endocrine alterations associated with major
      depression.
PG  - 401-18
AB  - Aging and menopause are associated with alterations of the sleep EEG, while
      age-related changes of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis remain
      controversial. Major depression is also associated with typical sleep-endocrine
      changes, including enhanced activity of the HPA axis, while an influence of age
      and gender on these alterations is less clear. To test the hypothesis that after 
      menopause sleep-endocrine alterations associated with major depression are
      accentuated, we examined the sleep EEG and nocturnal hormone secretion (ACTH,
      cortisol, GH, estradiol, LH, FSH, and leptin) in 16 drug-free female patients,
      mostly with the first episode of a major depressive disorder (seven pre- and nine
      postmenopausal subjects) and 19 female controls (10 subjects in the early
      follicular phase and nine postmenopausal subjects). Nocturnal cortisol secretion 
      was increased in postmenopausal patients with depression, while a decrease was
      noted in postmenopausal controls. Sleep alterations typically associated with
      depression, namely a reduction in sleep continuity and slow wave sleep (SWS) and 
      an increase in REM density, were prominent in post- but not in premenopausal
      patients. An inverse correlation was noted between the decline in SWS and sleep
      continuity and FSH secretion in patients with depression, suggesting a role of
      menopause for these sleep-endocrine alterations typically associated with major
      depression. In contrast, in premenopausal patients we noted primarily a shift in 
      SWS and delta-EEG activity from the first to the second non-REM period, which was
      not related to age or hormone secretion. Though the relatively small number of
      subjects per group precludes a definitive conclusion, our data open up the
      possibility that the sleep-endocrine changes typically associated with major
      depression are most prominent in postmenopausal patients. Whether the predominant
      alteration of the distribution of SWS and delta EEG activity in younger patients 
      with a first episode of major depression has a predictive value for the future
      course of the disease remains to be investigated.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of phytoestrogen supplementation, growth and bone
      turnover in adolescent males.
PG  - 324-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of phytoestrogens on bone turnover and growth in 
      adolescent boys. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
      SETTING: Single school in northwest Tasmania. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescent boys
      (treatment n=69, placebo n=59, mean age 16.8 y). INTERVENTIONS: Six weeks of
      isoflavone supplementation (Novasoy, 50 mg daily of isoflavone equivalents). Bone
      turnover markers (bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and pyridinoline
      creatinine ratio (PYR)) were measured at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: Despite
      marked increases in urinary genistein and daidzein in the treatment arm (both
      P<0.001), there were no significant differences in BAP, PYR or short-term height 
      or weight change. This applied to both intention-to-treat and per protocol
      analysis. Neither was there a significant correlation between urinary genistein
      and daidzein levels and BAP or PYR. CONCLUSIONS: Phytoestrogen supplementation to
      the level of usual Japanese dietary intake has no measurable effect on bone
      turnover in adolescent boys. Longer-term studies of bone density may be desirable
      but it is unlikely that there will be a large effect in either girls or boys
      given the lower endogenous oestrogen levels in boys.

TI  - Acute effects of transdermal estrogen on hemodynamic and vascular reactivity in
      elderly postmenopausal healthy women.
PG  - 387-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The acute effects of estrogen on hemodynamic responses were studied
      with emphasis on the sympathoadrenal system and peripheral circulation. DESIGN:
      Eleven healthy postmenopausal women recruited from the population-based study
      BEDA were included in this randomized, double-blind, cross-over,
      placebo-controlled hypothesis-generating pilot study, where the effect of
      transdermal estrogen (17 beta-estradiol, 100 microg/24 h) was tested. METHODS:
      Twenty-four hours after the patch with estrogen/placebo was attached, the blood
      pressure during rest and mental stress test was measured, together with blood
      samples for analysis of P-adrenaline and P-noradrenaline. Twenty-four-hour
      ambulatory registration of blood pressure and heart rate were recorded.
      Contractile properties and endothelial function of subcutaneous small arteries
      from gluteal biopsies were studied with the wire-myograph technique. RESULTS:
      Estrogen treatment reduced both ambulatory systolic blood pressure (5 mmHg, P =
      0.05), diastolic blood pressure (3 mmHg, P < 0.05) and heart rate (6-8 beats/min 
      during morning hours, P < 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure during and after mental
      stress was significantly reduced after estrogen treatment (p < 0.01). The levels 
      of P-adrenaline and P-noradrenaline were similar in both treatment protocols. The
      contractile properties of the arteries were not significantly influenced by
      estrogen. Substance P induced nitric oxide-dependent relaxation in both
      estrogen-treated and placebo-treated precontracted arteries. Acetylcholine, on
      the other hand, induced a non-nitric oxide, non-prostanoid-dependent
      hyperpolarization, which was inhibited by potassium-induced depolarization after 
      placebo but not after estrogen treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Acute administration of
      transdermal estrogen in clinically relevant doses modulates hemodynamics,
      probably by an altered parasympathetic balance, which might involve changes at
      the muscarinic receptor level.

TI  - A pilot study comparing the clinical effects of Jia-Wey Shiau-Yau San, a
      traditional Chinese herbal prescription, and a continuous combined hormone
      replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms.
PG  - 55-62
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Interest in use of alternative remedies for managing menopausal
      symptoms is increasing exponentially during these years. Jia-Wey Shiau-Yau San
      (JWSYS), one of the traditional Chinese herbal prescriptions, is a famous herbal 
      remedy used for the management of various menopausal-related symptoms. A
      randomized, controlled pilot study was performed to evaluate the clinical effects
      of JWSYS compared with those of a continuous combined hormone replacement
      therapy, Premelle, on quality of life in non-hysterectomized postmenopausal
      women. METHODS: The present trial compared the effect of a l6-week treatment with
      JWSYS or HRT (Premelle) in postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms. The
      Greene Climacteric Scale was used to assess the clinical effects at baseline and 
      after 16 weeks' treatment with either JWSYS or Premelle. The physiological
      parameters, such as follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels, were also 
      recorded at the same time points. RESULTS: The results showed that JWSYS had a
      relatively lower discontinuation rate due to adverse effects, in particular the
      bleeding and breast tenderness. Both JWSYS and Premelle effectively alleviated
      most of the menopausal symptoms with no significant differences between treatment
      groups, whereas the beneficial effects of JWSYS were not mediated by hormone
      replacement-like effects. Moreover, JWSYS showed a good compliance and safety
      without estrogenic effects and metabolic alterations. CONCLUSIONS: It was
      suggested that JWSYS was a safe and efficacious therapy and might be an
      alternative choice for relief of climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women.
      However, the exact efficacy and clinical roles of JWSYS have not been
      convincingly demonstrated in this study because of the blinding approach and some
      statistical concerns, and only the possibility of its efficacy has been raised.
      Therefore, a blinding trial with more patient numbers to evaluate the efficacy of
      JWSYS deserves further study.

TI  - Sexual diergism of baseline plasma leptin and leptin suppression by arginine
      vasopressin in major depressives and matched controls.
PG  - 255-68
AB  - Leptin inhibits appetite by activating several neuroendocrine systems, including 
      the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal cortical (HPA) axis. In turn, chronically
      elevated glucocorticoids increase circulating leptin. HPA axis hyperactivity
      occurs in 30-50% of patients with major depression, but the few prior reports of 
      leptin measurements in this illness have shown inconsistent results. We,
      therefore, measured plasma leptin in 12 female and 8 male unipolar major
      depressives and 12 female and 8 male individually matched normal controls
      administered low-dose physostigmine (PHYSO) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) to
      stimulate the HPA axis. The subjects underwent four test sessions 5-7 days apart:
      PHYSO (8 microg/kg IV); AVP (0-08 U/kg IM); PHYSO+AVP; and saline control. Serial
      blood samples were taken before and after pharmacologic challenge and analyzed
      for leptin, ACTH(1-39), cortisol and AVP. Estradiol and testosterone also were
      measured at each test session. PHYSO and AVP produced no side effects in
      approximately half the subjects and predominantly mild side effects in the other 
      half, with no significant patient-control differences. Correlations between side 
      effects (absent or present) after PHYSO or AVP and the corresponding leptin
      responses were non-significant in all groups. Baseline plasma leptin
      concentrations (mean+/-S.D.) were significantly higher in the female patients
      compared to the female controls (22.5+/-13.9 ng/ml vs. 12.3+/-9.7 ng/ml), whereas
      they were similar in the male patients and the male controls (3.9+/-1.4 ng/ml vs.
      3.6+/-2.0 ng/ml). Leptin concentrations following PHYSO remained unchanged from
      baseline, indicating that the short-lived ACTH and cortisol increases produced by
      PHYSO did not affect leptin secretion. In contrast, AVP administration, while
      also increasing ACTH and cortisol, significantly suppressed leptin, more so in
      the women than in the men. Baseline leptin and the leptin decrease after AVP were
      moderately positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Scale
      'somatization' factor in the female patients (r=0.50) and more strongly
      correlated with the 'mood-depression' factor in the male patients (r=0.81). These
      findings indicate a sexual diergism (functional sex difference) in plasma leptin 
      measures between major depressives and matched normal controls.

TI  - C-reactive protein increases plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression and
      activity in human aortic endothelial cells: implications for the metabolic
      syndrome and atherothrombosis.
PG  - 398-404
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays a pivotal role in atherosclerosis. In addition to 
      being a risk marker for cardiovascular disease, much recent data suggest that
      C-reactive protein (CRP) promotes atherogenesis via effects on monocytes and
      endothelial cells. The metabolic syndrome is associated with significantly
      elevated levels of CRP. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a marker of
      atherothrombosis, is also elevated in the metabolic syndrome and in diabetes, and
      endothelial cells are the major source of PAI-1. However, there are no studies
      examining the effect of CRP on PAI-1 in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs).
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Incubation of HAECs with CRP results in a time- and
      dose-dependent increase in secreted PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity, intracellular 
      PAI-1 protein, and PAI-1 mRNA. CRP stabilizes PAI-1 mRNA. Inhibitors of
      endothelial NO synthase, blocking antibodies to interleukin-6 and an endothelin-1
      receptor blocker, fail to attenuate the effect of CRP on PAI-1. CRP additionally 
      increased PAI-1 under hyperglycemic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This study makes the
      novel observation that CRP induces PAI-1 expression and activity in HAECs and
      thus has implications for both the metabolic syndrome and atherothrombosis.

TI  - C-reactive protein, the metabolic syndrome, and risk of incident cardiovascular
      events: an 8-year follow-up of 14 719 initially healthy American women.
PG  - 391-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The metabolic syndrome describes a high-risk population having 3 or
      more of the following clinical characteristics: upper-body obesity,
      hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, hypertension, and abnormal glucose. All of these
      attributes, however, are associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein
      (CRP). METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated interrelationships between CRP, the
      metabolic syndrome, and incident cardiovascular events among 14 719 apparently
      healthy women who were followed up for an 8-year period for myocardial
      infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death; 24% of
      the cohort had the metabolic syndrome at study entry. At baseline, median CRP
      levels for those with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 characteristics of the metabolic
      syndrome were 0.68, 1.09, 1.93, 3.01, 3.88, and 5.75 mg/L, respectively (P(trend)
      <0.0001). Over the 8-year follow-up, cardiovascular event-free survival rates
      based on CRP levels above or below 3.0 mg/L were similar to survival rates based 
      on having 3 or more characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. At all levels of
      severity of the metabolic syndrome, however, CRP added prognostic information on 
      subsequent risk. For example, among those with the metabolic syndrome at study
      entry, age-adjusted incidence rates of future cardiovascular events were 3.4 and 
      5.9 per 1000 person-years of exposure for those with baseline CRP levels less
      than or greater than 3.0 mg/L, respectively. Additive effects for CRP were also
      observed for those with 4 or 5 characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. The use
      of different definitions of the metabolic syndrome had minimal impact on these
      findings. CONCLUSIONS: These prospective data suggest that measurement of CRP
      adds clinically important prognostic information to the metabolic syndrome.

TI  - Influence of raloxifene on the efficacy of an estradiol-releasing ring for
      treating vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 45-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential interaction of oral raloxifene 60 mg/day on
      the efficacy of a low-dose, estradiol-releasing vaginal ring used to treat signs 
      and symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment trial of raloxifene and
      placebo with open-label 17beta-estradiol ring. At 10 sites in the United States, 
      91 postmenopausal women with at least two signs of vaginal atrophy were treated
      with a 17beta-estradiol ring and randomized to receive concomitant raloxifene 60 
      mg/day or placebo for 6 months. Efficacy of treatments was evaluated by comparing
      investigator assessments of genitourinary atrophic signs, vaginal maturation
      value, and participant assessments of vaginal symptoms at 6 months. Other
      measures included rate and severity of hot flashes and assessment of sexual
      function. Uterine safety was assessed by endometrial biopsy and transvaginal
      ultrasound. RESULTS: In women treated with a 17beta-estradiol ring, both the
      raloxifene and placebo treatment groups showed improvements in signs and symptoms
      of vaginal atrophy at 6 months, with no significant differences in degree of
      improvement between groups. There were no signs of endometrial proliferation in
      either group. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant administration of raloxifene does not
      alter the effects of the 17beta-estradiol ring on alleviating signs and symptoms 
      of genitourinary atrophy in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism and bone metabolism during low-dose oral
      contraceptive use in young women.
PG  - 33-7
AB  - With the aim to determine whether bone metabolism in young women using low-dose
      oral contraception is influenced by vitamin D receptor (VDR) genotype, we
      designed the prospective clinical study of 41 healthy women aged 20-27 years.
      Twenty-one women of the study group were prescribed an oral contraceptive (30
      microg ethynyl estradiol and 150 microg levonorgestrel) and 20 women of the
      control group a nonhormonal contraceptive or none. Biochemical markers of bone
      metabolism (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, deoxypyridinoline)
      and VDR genotype, using BsmI endonuclease, were determined. After 3 months in the
      study group, the BB genotype subgroup showed significantly decreased osteocalcin 
      (p = 0.010), in the Bb genotype subgroup bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (p = 
      0.043) and osteocalcin (p = 0.006) decreased, and in the bb genotype subgroup no 
      changes were observed. In the control group, there were no significant changes in
      markers of bone metabolism regarding VDR genotype. In conclusion, our study shows
      that in young women VDR gene polymorphism could influence bone metabolism during 
      low-dose oral contraceptive use.

TI  - Bleeding patterns and patient acceptability of standard or continuous dosing
      regimens of a low-dose oral contraceptive: a randomized trial.
PG  - 9-13
AB  - The purpose of this study is to compare bleeding patterns and acceptability of a 
      contraceptive regimen of combined 20 microg ethinyl estradiol/100 microg
      levonorgestrel taken with and without a hormone-free interval. Thirty-two women
      desiring oral contraception were randomized to six 28-day cycles (standard group)
      or 168 days without a pill-free interval (continuous group). Participants kept a 
      daily bleeding calendar documenting bleeding events (none, spotting or required
      sanitary protection) and side effects (headache, nausea, breast tenderness,
      depression, premenstrual syndrome and bloating). Primary outcome was number of
      bleeding days. Secondary outcomes included bleeding days requiring sanitary
      protection, amenorrhea, patient acceptability of bleeding patterns, method
      satisfaction and affective side effects. There were no differences in the
      baseline characteristics of the two groups. Although total bleeding days were
      fewer in the continuous group (mean = 25.9 vs. 34.9 days), this result did not
      reach statistical significance. However, women in the continuous group reported
      significantly fewer bleeding days that required protection (18.4 vs. 33.8 days, p
      < 0.01), and were more likely to have amenorrhea. Although both groups reported a
      high level of satisfaction with bleeding patterns and side effect profiles, women
      in the continuous group reported significantly fewer days of bloating (0.7 vs.
      11.1 days, p = 0.04), and menstrual pain (1.9 vs. 13.3 days, p < 0.01).
      Continuous use of 20 microg ethinyl estradiol/100 microg levonorgestrel is
      associated with less bleeding requiring protection, and more amenorrhea than
      standard administration. Taken with or without a hormone-free interval, this oral
      contraceptive formulation is highly acceptable with regard to bleeding patterns
      and side effect profile. The continuous group had fewer light and moderate
      bleeding days, less bloating and menstrual pain. For patients who are seeking
      these results, this method may be more desirable.

      pulsatility was unaffected by an energy availability of 30 kcal/kg LBM.d (P >
      0.3), but below this threshold LH pulse frequency decreased, whereas LH pulse
      amplitude increased (all P < 0.04). This disruption was more extreme in women
      with short luteal phases (P < 0.01). These incremental effects most closely
      resembled the effects of energy availability on plasma glucose,
      beta-hydroxybutyrate, GH, and cortisol and contrasted with the dependencies
      displayed by the other metabolic hormones (simultaneously P < 0.05). These
      results demonstrate that LH pulsatility is disrupted only below a threshold of
      energy availability deep into negative energy balance and suggest priorities for 
      future investigations into the mechanism that mediates the nonlinear dependence
      of LH pulsatility on energy availability.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of estrogen replacement therapy in long-term users 
      of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate.
PG  - 78-81
AB  - Long-term use of the injectable contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate
      (DMPA, Depo-Provera) is associated with a reduction in bone mineral density
      (BMD), particularly in the lumbar spine. The cause of DMPA-associated bone loss
      is not known, but the relative estrogen deficiency induced by DMPA use could be
      responsible. We have undertaken a randomized, double-blind controlled trial of
      oral estrogen replacement therapy in 38 premenopausal women (mean age 37) with a 
      minimum 2 yr DMPA use who had a below average baseline lumbar spine BMD (T score 
      < or = 0). Nineteen women were allocated to receive conjugated estrogens (0.625
      mg/d orally) and 19 to receive a matching placebo. All continued with regular
      DMPA injections throughout the study. Areal bone density was measured by dual
      energy x-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total body
      sites every 6 months for 2 yr; the main outcome measure being the change in areal
      BMD at the lumbar spine. At baseline, the two groups were well matched for
      demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical variables, and for BMD. Twenty-seven
      subjects completed at least 18 months in the study, and 26 the full 2 yr, with
      similar numbers dropping out from each group (mainly for personal reasons). In
      the estrogen-treated group, mean lumbar spine BMD increased 1%, whereas in the
      placebo group it fell 2.6%, over 2 yr. The between group differences were 2.0% at
      12 months (P = 0.058), 3.2% at 18 months (P < 0.01), and 3.5% at 24 months (P <
      0.002). Differences of lesser statistical magnitude were seen at the femoral neck
      (between group differences at 2 yr: 2.7%, P = 0.24), Ward's triangle (5.0%, P =
      0.055), greater trochanter (3.6%, P = 0.056), total body (1.3%, P = 0.046), legs 
      (1.3%, P = 0.065), and trunk (2.0%, P = 0.029). There were no major adverse
      events. These data support the view that the likely cause of DMPA-associated bone
      loss is estrogen deficiency and demonstrate that it can be arrested by estrogen
      replacement therapy.

TI  - Oestrogen therapy for prevention of reinfarction in postmenopausal women: a
      randomised placebo controlled trial.
PG  - 2001-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results of observational studies suggest that hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but those of
      randomised trials do not indicate a lower risk in women who use oestrogen plus
      progestagen. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether or not unopposed
      oestrogen reduces the risk of further cardiac events in postmenopausal women who 
      survive a first myocardial infarction. METHODS: The study was a randomised,
      blinded, placebo controlled, secondary prevention trial of postmenopausal women, 
      age 50-69 years (n=1017) who had survived a first myocardial infarction.
      Individuals were recruited from 35 hospitals in England and Wales. Women received
      either one tablet of oestradiol valerate (2 mg; n=513) or placebo (n=504), daily 
      for 2 years. Primary outcomes were reinfarction or cardiac death, and all-cause
      mortality. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were uterine
      bleeding, endometrial cancer, stroke or other embolic events, and fractures.
      FINDINGS: Frequency of reinfarction or cardiac death did not differ between
      treatment groups at 24 months (rate ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.70-1.41, p=0.97).
      Similarly, the reduction in all-cause mortality between those who took oestrogen 
      and those on placebo was not significant (0.79, 0.50-1.27, p=0.34). The relative 
      risk of any death (0.56, 0.23-1.33) and cardiac death (0.33, 0.11-1.01) was
      lowest at 3 months post-recruitment. INTERPRETATION: Oestradiol valerate does not
      reduce the overall risk of further cardiac events in postmenopausal women who
      have survived a myocardial infarction.

AB  - This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled exploratory study examined the 
      efficacy and safety of a low-dose oral contraceptive (Mircette),
      desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol [DSG/EE] and ethinyl estradiol [EE]) in relieving
      the symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Twenty-three clinics in the United States enrolled 
      77 women (age < or =32 years) with primary dysmenorrhea documented for at least
      four consecutive cycles. Forty participants received DSG/EE&EE and 37 received
      placebo for four consecutive 28-day cycles. The intensity of menstrual-related
      distress was measured with the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ). Patient
      diaries were used to assess number of school/work days missed as well as the use 
      of rescue medication. Participants receiving DSG/EE&EE recorded reduced menstrual
      pain severity, lower total MDQ scores, and significantly less menstrual cramping.
      No significant change in bloating, anxiety, loneliness, weight gain, or acne was 
      reported. The DSG/EE&EE formulation shows promise for the treatment of primary
      dysmenorrhea and was well tolerated by the participants in this study.

PG  - 985-93
AB  - The new combined oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone
      has the potential for improving a woman's quality of life. Drospirenone's
      antiandrogenic activity, for example, makes it effective in reducing acne and
      seborrhea. The majority of reproductive-age women suffer from some degree of
      premenstrual symptomatology. In some cases, these monthly symptoms are severe
      enough to negatively impact a woman's quality of life. Drospirenone's
      antimineralocorticoid activity aids in reducing some of the most bothersome
      symptoms associated with the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle.

TI  - FDA drug approval summaries: fulvestrant.
PG  - 477-80
AB  - Patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer who have responded to tamoxifen may
      receive additional benefit from a second endocrine agent following progression or
      relapse after tamoxifen therapy. Fulvestrant (Faslodex((R)), ICI 182780,
      AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals; Wilmington, Delaware) is a selective antagonist of
      estrogen designed to have no estrogenic effects. Lack of aqueous solubility led
      to the development of a parenteral formulation for monthly intramuscular
      administration. Fulvestrant has been shown to inhibit the proliferative effects
      of estrogen on sensitive tissues in vitro and in vivo, and is without apparent
      measurable estrogenic activity. The data upon which marketing approval for
      fulvestrant was based are summarized below. Eight hundred fifty-one
      postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer were enrolled in two phase III
      studies, 400 in a North American double-blind study and 451 in a European
      open-label study, comparing the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant with
      anastrozole. Four hundred twenty-eight patients were randomized to receive
      fulvestrant 250 mg monthly by intramuscular injection and 423 patients were to
      receive anastrozole 1 mg daily. Patients were considered hormone sensitive either
      by receptor status or previous response to endocrine therapy. Over 96% of
      patients had previously received tamoxifen, either in the adjuvant setting or as 
      treatment for metastatic disease. The primary study end points were response rate
      and time to progression. Response rates for patients treated with fulvestrant
      were 17% and 20% in the North American and European trials, respectively,
      compared with 17% and 15% in the anastrozole treatment arms. There were no
      statistically significant differences in response rates, time to progression, or 
      survival between treatment arms in either study. The most common adverse events
      attributed to the treatment (>10%) were injection-site reactions and hot flashes.
      Common events (1%-10%) included asthenia, headache, and gastrointestinal
      disturbances (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), as well as rash and urinary tract 
      infections. A small increase in joint disorders was reported in the
      anastrozole-treated patients. On April 25, 2002, fulvestrant 250 mg by monthly
      intramuscular injection was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
      the treatment of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer in
      postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy.
      Approval was based on similarity of response rates and time to progression
      between fulvestrant and anastrozole.

TI  - Responsiveness of the Acne-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (Acne-QoL) to
      treatment for acne vulgaris in placebo-controlled clinical trials.
PG  - 809-16
AB  - The Acne-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (Acne-QoL) was developed to
      measure the impact of facial acne across four dimensions of patient quality of
      life. The main objective of the current study was to evaluate the responsiveness 
      of this instrument. Secondarily, this study provided an opportunity to extend the
      developer's psychometric validation. The Acne-QoL was utilized in two randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of the efficacy of Estrostep
      (norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol) in the treatment of facial acne; a
      total of 296 Estrostep and 295 placebo patients were evaluated. The Acne-QoL was 
      completed at the beginning, middle (cycle 3), and end (cycle 6) of the 6-month
      treatment period. The responsiveness of the Acne-QoL was demonstrated through its
      ability to detect both small (baseline to mid-study) and moderate (baseline to
      study end) treatment advantages for Estrostep patients. Confirmatory factor
      analysis supported the subscale structure, and internal consistency estimates
      were excellent. Convergent and discriminant validity were supported by
      correlations between Acne-QoL scores and clinical measures that were both in the 
      direction and relative magnitude hypothesized. Finally, item response theory
      analyses confirmed that each item is highly related to its subscale's latent
      construct and that each subscale is sensitive across a broad range of the
      underlying continuum. The results of this evaluation confirm that the Acne-QoL is
      responsive, internally consistent, and valid.

TI  - Pulsed estrogen therapy: relieving climacteric symptoms, preventing
      postmenopausal bone loss.
PG  - 32-9
AB  - Aerodiol with its new mode of action--pulsed estrogen therapy made possible by a 
      unique pharmacokinetic profile and an innovative route of administration--acts on
      the full range of climacteric symptoms and on the long-term consequences of
      estrogen deprivation. Four well-designed, international studies investigating the
      efficacy of pulsed estrogen therapy on both the short- and long-term consequences
      of estrogen deprivation were conducted. Climacteric symptoms and their reduction 
      were assessed individually and also using the Kupperman index, which is a
      weighted score. Aerodiol produced a significant reduction in the Kupperman index 
      and in the occurrence of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes and night
      sweats. This reduction appeared to be significant as early as the second week of 
      treatment. Moreover, Aerodiol remained effective even among highly symptomatic
      women with more than seven hot flushes per day, and also among smokers. Since it 
      avoids hepatic first-pass metabolism, pulsed estrogen therapy also has a
      favorable action on the lipid profile, decreasing lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein 
      B, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore,
      Aerodiol is neutral with regard to clotting factors, angiotensinogen and insulin 
      levels. The effect of pulsed estrogen therapy on bone has been assessed in both
      the short and the long term. Bone turnover, as measured by markers of resorption 
      and formation, was normalized to premenopausal levels after 3 months of treatment
      at a dose of 300 microg/day. Aerodiol, again at the dose of 300 microg/day, is as
      effective as a 50-microg/day transdermal patch in increasing bone mineral density
      (p < 0.001 versus baseline) at the spine and hip after 56 weeks. Finally, data
      collected during the development of Aerodiol have shown that pulsed estrogen
      therapy is at least as effective as 2 mg of oral estrogen or 50 microg of
      transdermal estrogen in relieving climacteric symptoms and preventing
      postmenopausal bone loss.

TI  - The pattern of alveolar crest height change in healthy postmenopausal women after
      3 years of hormone/estrogen replacement therapy.
PG  - 1279-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: The loss of ovarian function at menopause is associated with loss of 
      postcranial and oral bone. Hormone/estrogen replacement therapy (HRT/ERT) has a
      positive effect on both postcranial and oral bone. The objective of the study was
      to determine if the positive effect of HRT/ERT on alveolar crest height (ACH) is 
      generalized or site specific. METHODS: The sample consisted of 49 women who
      completed a 3-year, HRT/ERT prospective study. Cemento-enamel junction distances 
      (ACH) were measured on digitized images of bitewing radiographs. Lumbar spine and
      proximal femur bone mineral densities (BMDs) were determined with dual-energy
      x-ray absorptiometric scans. Measurements were made at baseline and at the end of
      year 3. For the 3-year study period, mean change in ACH was determined for each
      patient. In addition, the sites with the greatest, second and third greatest ACH 
      changes were determined for each patient. Correlations between changes in ACH (as
      determined by the various methods) and postcranial BMD were determined. RESULTS: 
      Mean ACH changes had an average correlation (r) of -0.24 with femoral and lumbar 
      spine BMDs. Although the largest site-specific change in ACH resulted in a mean
      correlation of -0.21, the correlations for the second and third largest changes
      in ACH dropped to -0.15 and -0.12. Overall, the correlations for site-specific
      changes were substantively smaller than those for generalized change.
      CONCLUSIONS: The data of this study indicate that ACH change attributable to
      HRT/ERT is generalized rather than site specific. Studies of the effect of
      HRT/ERT on ACH should employ multiple measurements to minimize measurement errors
      associated with site-specific measurements.

TI  - Effect of Lepidium meyenii (MACA) on sexual desire and its absent relationship
      with serum testosterone levels in adult healthy men.
PG  - 367-72
AB  - This study was a 12-week double blind placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel
      trial in which active treatment with different doses of Maca Gelatinizada was
      compared with placebo. The study aimed to demonstrate if effect of Maca on
      subjective report of sexual desire was because of effect on mood or serum
      testosterone levels. Men aged 21-56 years received Maca in one of two doses:
      1,500 mg or 3,000 mg or placebo. Self-perception on sexual desire, score for
      Hamilton test for depression, and Hamilton test for anxiety were measured at 4, 8
      and 12 weeks of treatment. An improvement in sexual desire was observed with Maca
      since 8 weeks of treatment. Serum testosterone and oestradiol levels were not
      different in men treated with Maca and in those treated with placebo (P:NS).
      Logistic regression analysis showed that Maca has an independent effect on sexual
      desire at 8 and 12 weeks of treatment, and this effect is not because of changes 
      in either Hamilton scores for depression or anxiety or serum testosterone and
      oestradiol levels. In conclusion, treatment with Maca improved sexual desire.

TI  - Menopausal symptoms in older women and the effects of treatment with hormone
      therapy.
PG  - 1209-18
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In some women, hot flashes and other symptoms attributed to menopause 
      persist for many years after the cessation of menses. The frequency and severity 
      of such symptoms and response to hormone therapy in older women have not been
      well documented. METHODS: We used data from the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin
      Replacement Study, a blinded, clinical trial among 2763 women with documented
      coronary disease and a uterus who were randomized to receive either conjugated
      estrogens 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg in one tablet or
      placebo. Participants were queried at baseline and annually regarding menopausal 
      symptoms. Breast symptoms were self-reported, and uterine bleeding was recorded
      on a daily diary. RESULTS: Symptoms associated with menopause were relatively
      common among Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study participants, whose
      average age was 67 years and who averaged 18 years since menopause. At baseline, 
      16% of women reported frequent hot flashes, 26% vaginal dryness, 10% genital
      irritation, 55% trouble sleeping, and 53% early awakening. Women assigned to
      hormone therapy reported less frequent hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and trouble 
      sleeping compared with women assigned to placebo, but more frequent vaginal
      discharge, genital irritation, uterine bleeding, and breast symptoms. The
      reporting of breast symptoms among women in the hormone group decreased from 40% 
      at 1 year to 13% by the 4th year. Uterine bleeding was reported by 31% and
      spotting by an additional 33% of women in the hormone group during the 1st year
      of treatment; by the 4th year, these proportions had fallen to 11% and 20%,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Symptoms typically attributed to menopause are common
      in elderly women. Postmenopausal hormone therapy reduces hot flashes, trouble
      sleeping, and vaginal dryness, but at standard doses in elderly women is
      associated with vaginal discharge, genital irritation, uterine bleeding, and
      breast symptoms.

TI  - Bleeding patterns in peri and postmenopausal women taking a continuous combined
      regimen of estradiol with norethisterone acetate or a conventional sequential
      regimen of conjugated equine estrogens with medrogestone.
PG  - 265-75
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of women
      presenting irregular bleeding episodes following 9 months of treatment with a low
      dose continuous combined hormone replacement therapy consisting of estradiol
      (E(2)) and norethisterone acetate (NETA) versus a sequential hormone replacement 
      therapy consisting of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) and medrogestone (MG).
      Secondary aims were to establish the relationship between menopausal age and the 
      occurrence of irregular bleeding for both therapies and to assess the efficacy of
      both therapies in alleviating menopausal symptoms. METHODS: This was a stratified
      and randomised, open label study conducted with late peri and postmenopausal
      women at 35 sites in Austria and Germany. A total of 446 women were randomly
      allocated into two cohorts based on time since last bleeding and then stratified 
      to either a low dose continuous combined therapy consisting of 1 mg E(2) and 0.5 
      mg NETA for 28 days or a sequential therapy consisting of 0.625 mg CEE for 28
      days and 5 mg MG for the final 14 days. Bleeding and menopausal complaints were
      continuously assessed. Treatments were administered for 9 lunar months. RESULTS: 
      The incidence rate of women presenting irregular bleeding episodes including
      spotting during cycle 9 was 12.2% with 1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA and 25.8% with
      0.625mgCEE/5mgMG (P = 0.0014). In the group of postmenopausal women (time since
      last bleeding > or = 12 months) the incidence of irregular bleeding during cycle 
      9 was 11.0% for 1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA and 25.0% for 0.625mgCEE/5mgMG). In the group
      of late perimenopausal women (time since last bleeding 6-11 months) the incidence
      of irregular bleeding was similar for both treatments at cycle 3, but markedly
      less in patients with 1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA at cycle 6 and 9, being significantly
      different compared to patients with 0.625mgCEE/5mgMG at cycle 6 (P < 0.05). The
      cumulative rate of amenorrhea (no bleeding or spotting) achieved with
      1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA was 89% for the postmenopausal women and 83.7% for the late
      perimenopausal women. Both treatments relieved menopausal complaints equally
      effective. CONCLUSIONS: Regarding the occurrence of irregular bleeding, the low
      dose continuous combined therapy was superior to the sequential therapy
      (0.625mgCEE/5mgMG). The low dose continuous combined E(2)/NETA regimen is also
      suitable for late perimenopausal women since more than 80% of the women had no
      bleeding or spotting after 9 months of treatment.

      measures of body composition, physical performance, mood, sexual function, bone
      turnover, and muscle gene expression in healthy older men.
PG  - 5649-57
AB  - We examined the effects of GH and/or testosterone (T) administration on body
      composition, performance, mood, sexual function, bone turnover, and muscle-gene
      expression in healthy older men. Ten men [mean (SEM) age, 68 (2.5) yr; height,
      171.5 (2.4) cm; and weight, 80 (3.0) kg] completed each of the following 1-month,
      double-blind interventions after a baseline (B) study in randomized order with an
      intervening 3-month washout: transdermal T patch (5.0 mg/daily); recombinant
      human GH (6.25 micro g/kg sc daily); and combined hormones (GHT). ANOVA with
      repeated measures was used to evaluate interventional effects. Integrated serum
      GH concentrations [mean (SEM)] were elevated comparably by GH and GHT: [B = 363
      (55), GH = 1107 (120), T = 459 (131), and GHT = 1189 (46) micro g/liter.min; P < 
      0.0001]. Serum IGF-I concentrations also increased commensurately after GH and
      GHT: [B = 168 (14), GH = 285 (16), T = 192 (25), and GHT = 294 (25) micro
      g/liter; P < 0.0001]. GHT administration increased total estradiol: [B = 110
      (20), GH = 106 (13), T = 129 (13), and GHT = 153 (17) pmol/liter; P < 0.02], and 
      both T and GHT elevated free T: [B = 12 (2.1), GH = 11 (1.5), T = 22 (2.8), and
      GHT = 24 (2.5) pg/ml; P < 0.0001]. No significant changes occurred in strength,
      flexibility, percentage body fat, or sexual function and mood. However, fat-free 
      mass increased under combined GHT exposure: [B = 55 (1.3), GH = 56 (1.1), T = 55 
      (1.5), GHT = 57 (1.7) kg; P < 0.03]. Balance improved in response to GH
      intervention (P < 0.05), as did 30-m walk time during T and GHT interventions [B 
      = 6.6 (0.3), GH = 6.2 (0.7), T = 5.9 (0.3), GHT = 5.5 (0.3) sec; P = 0.04] and
      stair climb time for all three interventions [B = 32.2 (1.4), GH = 29.8 (1.2), T 
      = 30.5 (1.4), and GHT = 29.9 (1.2) sec (P = 0.0034), wherein the effects of GH,
      T, and GHT were different from that of B]. Muscle IGF-I gene expression increased
      by 1.9-fold during GH administration and by 2.3-fold during GHT administration (P
      < 0.05, compared with B). Myostatin and androgen receptor gene expression were
      not affected. Serum osteocalcin increased in response to the GH and GHT
      interventions: [B = 4.8 (0.52), GH = 5.7 (0.54), T = 4.7 (0.33), and GHT = 5.5
      (0.39); P <0.009]. There were no significant adverse events during 30
      patient-months of intervention. We conclude that 1 month of GH and/or T
      administration improves certain measures of balance and physical performance in
      older men and increases muscle IGF-I gene expression.

TI  - Effects of oral androstenedione administration on serum testosterone and
      estradiol levels in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 5449-54
AB  - Androstenedione is a steroid hormone and an intermediate in the synthetic pathway
      of both testosterone and estradiol in men and women. It is available without
      prescription and taken with the expectation that it may have beneficial effects
      on strength, general well-being, libido, and quality of life. Although studies
      have shown that oral androstenedione increases serum testosterone and estradiol
      levels in men, the hormonal effects of androstenedione in postmenopausal women
      are unknown. We randomly assigned 30 healthy postmenopausal women to receive 0,
      50, or 100 mg androstenedione as a single oral dose. After androstenedione
      administration, we made hourly measurements of serum androstenedione, estrone,
      estradiol, and testosterone concentrations during 12 h of frequent blood
      sampling. The mean change (+/-SD) in serum androstenedione area under the curve
      (AUC) was greater in both the 50-mg (79 +/- 39%) and 100-mg dose groups (242 +/- 
      184%) than in the control group (-29 +/- 28%) (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg 
      group and controls vs. 100-mg group). The mean change in serum androstenedione
      AUC was also greater in the 100-mg than 50-mg dose group (P = 0.0026). The mean
      change in serum estrone AUC was greater in both the 50-mg (108 +/- 72%) and
      100-mg dose groups (116 +/- 119%) than in the control group (-5 +/- 19%),
      although the control vs. 100-mg group comparison did not quite meet statistical
      significance (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group, P = 0.0631 controls vs.
      100-mg group). The mean change in serum estradiol AUC remained stable after
      supplementation in all groups without any between-group differences observed (-11
      +/- 17%, 2.8 +/- 34%, -11 +/- 27%, for the control, 50-mg, and 100-mg groups,
      respectively). The mean change in serum testosterone AUC was greater in both the 
      50-mg (185 +/- 146%) and 100-mg dose groups (457 +/- 601%) than in the control
      group (-27 +/- 13%) (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group and for controls vs.
      100-mg group). The mean change in testosterone AUC was also greater in the 100-mg
      dose group than 50-mg dose group (P = 0.0257). There was considerable individual 
      variability in the changes of serum androstenedione, estrone, and testosterone
      levels in the treated groups with peak serum testosterone levels exceeding the
      upper limit of normal in 4 of 10 women in the 50-mg dose group and 6 of 10 in the
      100-mg dose group. We concluded that the acute administration of both 50-mg and
      100-mg of androstenedione increases serum testosterone and estrone levels, but
      not estradiol levels, in postmenopausal women. If these hormonal effects are
      sustained during long-term administration, regular use of this supplement by
      postmenopausal women could thus cause both beneficial and adverse effects.

TI  - Effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy on cognitive function: the Heart and
      Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study.
PG  - 543-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if hormone therapy results in better cognitive function in 
      older postmenopausal women. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Heart and
      Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled 
      trial involving 2763 women with coronary disease. Women were assigned randomly to
      conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg) in one
      tablet daily or identical placebo; they were followed for a mean (+/- SD) of 4.2 
      +/- 0.4 years. Participants at 10 of the 20 HERS centers were invited to enroll
      in the cognitive function substudy. At the end of the trial, we measured
      cognitive function in 517 women in the hormone group and 546 in the placebo group
      using six standard tests: the modified Mini-Mental Status Examination, Verbal
      Fluency, Boston Naming, Word List Memory, Word List Recall, and Trails B.
      Cognitive function was not measured at baseline. RESULTS: The mean age of
      participants at the time of cognitive function testing was 71 +/- 6 years. There 
      were no differences in age-adjusted cognitive function test scores between the
      two treatment groups, except that women assigned to hormones scored worse on the 
      Verbal Fluency test than women assigned to placebo (15.9 +/- 4.8 vs. 16.6 +/-
      4.8, P = 0.02). Adjustment for other potential confounders and restriction of the
      analyses to women who had been adherent to study medication did not change the
      results. CONCLUSION: Among older postmenopausal women with coronary disease, 4
      years of treatment with postmenopausal hormone therapy did not result in better
      cognitive function as measured on six standardized tests. Whether these results
      also apply to elderly women without coronary disease cannot be determined from
      this study.

TI  - Significant differential effects of alendronate, estrogen, or combination therapy
      on the rate of bone loss after discontinuation of treatment of postmenopausal
      osteoporosis. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 875-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with alendronate and estrogen for 2 years
      increases bone mineral density at the spine and hip more than does therapy with
      either agent alone. Changes in bone mineral density after discontinuation of
      therapy have not been compared directly. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of bone
      loss when therapy with alendronate, estrogen, or both agents is discontinued.
      DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled discontinuation trial. SETTING: 18 U.S. 
      centers. PATIENTS: 244 postmenopausal, hysterectomized women 44 to 77 years of
      age. INTERVENTION: 2 years of therapy with alendronate, 10 mg/d (n = 92);
      conjugated estrogen, 0.625 mg/d (n = 143); alendronate and conjugated estrogen (n
      = 140); or placebo (n = 50). At year 3, women were allocated into five groups:
      Twenty-eight women continued to take placebo and 44 women continued to take
      combination therapy, but 50 women taking alendronate, 81 taking conjugated
      estrogen, and 41 taking combination therapy were switched to placebo.
      MEASUREMENTS: Bone mineral density and biochemical markers of bone turnover.
      RESULTS: Women taking alendronate or combination therapy who were switched to
      placebo for year 3 of the study maintained bone mass. Bone mineral density in
      these women was 4.1% (CI, 2.6% to 5.7%) and 6.6% (CI, 5.0% to 8.2%) higher,
      respectively, at the spine (P < 0.001 for both treatment comparisons) and 3.5%
      (CI, 2.3% to 4.6%) and 3.0% (CI, 1.8% to 4.2%) higher, respectively, at the
      trochanter (P < 0.001 for both treatment comparisons) than that in women
      previously taking estrogen who were switched to placebo. In contrast, women who
      were taking estrogen and were switched to placebo during year 3 experienced a
      4.5% decrease at the spine (95% CI, -5.0% to -4.0%) and a 2.4% decrease at the
      trochanter (CI, -2.7% to -2.1%) (P < 0.001 for both changes). Compared with women
      who took placebo for 3 years, women who took estrogen for 2 years and were then
      switched to placebo had a bone mineral density that was 2.9% higher (CI, 1.2% to 
      4.6%) at the spine (P < 0.05) and 2.9% higher (CI, 1.6% to 4.2%) at the
      trochanter (P < 0.001). Changes in biochemical markers during year 3 did not
      differ among the groups that discontinued active treatment. CONCLUSIONS:
      Accelerated bone loss is seen after withdrawal of estrogen therapy but not after 
      withdrawal of alendronate or combination therapy. The differential effects after 
      withdrawal of therapy should be considered in the management of postmenopausal
      osteoporosis.

TI  - A phase I trial to assess the pharmacology of the new oestrogen receptor
      antagonist fulvestrant on the endometrium in healthy postmenopausal volunteers.
PG  - 1354-9
AB  - While tamoxifen use is associated with clear benefits in the treatment of
      hormone-sensitive breast cancer, it also exhibits partial oestrogen agonist
      activity that is associated with adverse events, including endometrial cancer.
      Fulvestrant ("Faslodex") is a new oestrogen receptor antagonist that
      downregulates the oestrogen receptor and has no known agonist effect. This
      single-centre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group trial was conducted to
      determine the direct effects of fulvestrant on the female endometrium when given 
      alone and in combination with the oestrogen, ethinyloestradiol. Following a
      14-day, pretrial screening period, 30 eligible postmenopausal volunteers were
      randomised to receive fulvestrant 250 mg, fulvestrant 125 mg or matched placebo
      administered as a single intramuscular injection. Two weeks postinjection,
      volunteers received 2-weeks concurrent exposure to ethinyloestradiol 20 microg
      day(-1). Endometrial thickness was measured before and after the 14-day screening
      period with further measurements predose (to confirm a return to baseline) and on
      days 14, 28 and 42 post-treatment with fulvestrant. Pharmacokinetic and safety
      assessments were performed throughout the trial. Fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg 
      significantly (P=0.0001) inhibited the oestrogen-stimulated thickening of the
      endometrium compared with placebo. Neither the 125 mg nor 250 mg doses of
      fulvestrant demonstrated oestrogenic effects on the endometrium over the initial 
      14-day assessment period. Fulvestrant was well tolerated and reduced the
      incidence of ethinyloestradiol-related side effects. At the same dose level that 
      is being evaluated in clinical trials of postmenopausal women with advanced
      breast cancer, fulvestrant (250 mg) is an antioestrogen with no evidence of
      agonist activity in the endometrium of healthy postmenopausal women.

      (RUTH) trial.
PG  - 1204-10
AB  - The Raloxifene Use for The Heart (RUTH) trial is a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind trial designed to determine whether raloxifene
      60 mg/day compared with placebo lowers the risk of coronary events (coronary
      death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], or hospitalized acute coronary
      syndromes other than MI) and reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer in women 
      at risk for a major coronary event. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor
      modulator that improves cardiovascular risk factors, reduces the risk of
      vertebral fracture, and is associated with a reduced incidence of invasive breast
      cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Between June 1998 and August
      2000, 10,101 women were enrolled at 187 sites in 26 countries. Approximately half
      of the women had documented coronary heart disease (CHD) (n = 5,031); the
      remainder had multiple CHD risk factors that increased their risk for a CHD event
      (n = 5,070). The mean age of participants was 68 years (39% were >70 years old), 
      and did not differ between those with documented CHD and those at increased CHD
      risk. Most women were Caucasian (84%); 60% had a body mass index >/=27 kg/m(2),
      46% had diabetes mellitus, 78% had systemic hypertension, and 14% had low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol >160 mg/dl. Compared with women at increased CHD risk,
      women with documented CHD had higher cardiovascular risk scores, a higher
      prevalence of abnormal electrocardiograms, greater use of cardiovascular
      medications, were more likely to have had cardiac rehabilitation, and were more
      likely to have previously used estrogen or oral contraceptives, but had a
      slightly lower prevalence of CHD risk factors such as smoking, obesity, diabetes 
      mellitus, and systemic hypertension, and had lower serum levels of total and
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The RUTH cohort is the largest group of
      postmenopausal women at increased risk of CHD events ever assembled in a clinical
      trial, and is the first trial designed to determine the effect of a selective
      estrogen receptor modulator on the risk of CHD events.

TI  - Effects of ospemifene (FC-1271a) on uterine endometrium, vaginal maturation
      index, and hormonal status in healthy postmenopausal women.
PG  - 207-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are drugs that exhibit 
      both estrogen agonistic and antagonistic effects that are tissue-specific.
      Ospemifene (FC-1271a) is a novel SERM compound, which has been shown in animal
      models to have estrogen-like effects on bone and the cardiovascular system, while
      having antiestrogen-like effects in uterus and breast. In this study, we
      investigated the effects of ospemifene on the uterine endometrium, vaginal
      maturation index and hormonal status in healthy postmenopausal women. METHODS:
      The study was conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I study,
      where 40 healthy postmenopausal women volunteers were randomized to receive daily
      oral doses of ospemifene either 25, 50, 100 or 200 mg or placebo for 12 weeks.
      Vaginal ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy were performed and vaginal
      maturation index determined at baseline and at 12 weeks' visit. Serum
      concentrations of estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone
      (FSH), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), parathyroid hormone and prolactin
      were determined from samples taken at baseline, at 4 days and at 4, 12, and 16
      weeks' visits. Climacteric symptoms were assessed using 12 visual analogue scales
      (VAS) at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: No clinically significant
      changes were seen in endometrial thickness at any dose level. Ospemifene exerted 
      a very weak estrogenic effect on endometrial histology. On the other hand, it
      induced a clear estrogenic effect on vaginal epithelium. Among the endocrine
      parameters only FSH and SHBG showed significant dose dependent changes; FSH
      decreased and SHBG increased during the treatment. In general, ospemifene was
      well tolerated. The 25 and 50 mg doses tended to reduce climacteric symptoms, but
      no statistically significant differences were observed between different doses of
      ospemifene and placebo. The highest dose level (200 mg) induced more subjective
      adverse reactions, especially hot flushes, than lower doses. CONCLUSION: Our
      study suggests that a safe and well tolerated dose of ospemifene for potential
      clinical use may be between 25 and 100 mg. Further studies are needed to
      substantiate the results of this Phase I pilot study.

TI  - Pathophysiology and treatment of hot flashes.
PG  - 1207-18
AB  - Hot flashes affect about three fourths of postmenopausal women and are one of the
      most common health problems in this demographic group. Dysfunction of central
      thermoregulatory centers caused by changes in estrogen levels at the time of
      menopause has long been postulated to be the cause of hot flashes. Treatment
      should begin with a careful patient history, with specific attention to the
      frequency and severity of hot flashes and their effect on the individual's
      function. For mild symptoms that do not interfere with sleep or daily function,
      behavioral changes in conjunction with vitamin E (800 IU/d) use is a reasonable
      initial approach. For more severe symptoms, the next step is to determine whether
      there is a contraindication or a personal reservation to estrogen replacement
      therapy. For women who are able and willing to use estrogen, it will successfully
      relieve symptoms by about 80% to 90%. In patients with a history of breast or
      uterine cancer, treatment with the progestational agent megesterol acetate
      appears to be a safe alternative that also decreases hot flashes by approximately
      80%. For women unwilling or unable to use hormone therapy, one of the newer
      antidepressant agents can be prescribed. Venlafaxine decreases hot flashes by
      about 60%. Gabapentin is another drug that appears promising as therapy for women
      unable or unwilling to use estrogen, and the results of ongoing trials to
      determine its efficacy are eagerly awaited. The use of clonidine, methyldopa, and
      belladonna should be discouraged because of their modest efficacy and adverse
      effects.

TI  - Complementary and alternative medicine for menopausal symptoms: a review of
      randomized, controlled trials.
PG  - 805-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women commonly use soy products, herbs, and other complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM) therapies for menopausal symptoms. Randomized,
      controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy and short-term safety of these
      therapies. PURPOSE: To review randomized, controlled trials of CAM therapies for 
      menopausal symptoms in order to better inform practice and guide future research.
      DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE for articles published from January 1966
      through March 2002, of the Alternative and Complementary Database (AMED) of the
      British Library for articles published from January 1985 through December 2000,
      and of the authors' own extensive files. Search terms were hot flash/flush,
      menopause, and climacteric, combined with phytoestrogens, alternative medicine,
      herbal medicine, traditional medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM ),
      Ayurveda, naturopathy, chiropractic, osteopathy, massage, yoga, relaxation
      therapy, homeopathy, aromatherapy, and therapeutic touch. STUDY SELECTION: 29
      randomized, controlled clinical trials of CAM therapies for hot flashes and other
      menopausal symptoms were identified; of these, 12 dealt with soy or soy extracts,
      10 with herbs, and 7 with other CAM therapies. DATA EXTRACTION: Each author
      extracted information from half of the studies on the number of patients, study
      design, outcome measures, and results; the other author then checked these
      results. DATA SYNTHESIS: Soy seems to have modest benefit for hot flashes, but
      studies are not conclusive. Isoflavone preparations seem to be less effective
      than soy foods. Black cohosh may be effective for menopausal symptoms, especially
      hot flashes, but the lack of adequate long-term safety data (mainly on estrogenic
      stimulation of the breast or endometrium) precludes recommending long-term use.
      Single clinical trials have found that dong quai, evening primrose oil, a Chinese
      herb mixture, vitamin E, and acupuncture do not affect hot flashes; two trials
      have shown that red clover has no benefit for treating hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Black cohosh and foods that contain phytoestrogens show promise for the treatment
      of menopausal symptoms. Clinical trials do not support the use of other herbs or 
      CAM therapies. Long-term safety data on individual isoflavones or isoflavone
      concentrates are not available.

TI  - Hormone replacement therapy: optimising the dose and route of administration.
PG  - 807-18
AB  - Several new products and regimens for estrogen replacement in the postmenopausal 
      woman have recently been introduced, giving physicians and patients greater
      choice not only in dose but also in route of administration. Estrogen treatment
      in the postmenopausal woman has several proven benefits for those who have
      vasomotor symptoms or problems related to urogenital atrophy. However, the most
      controversial area is in the long-term preventive benefits of estrogen against
      the development of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, particularly in women
      older than 60 years. It is in these areas that decisions on the dose and optimal 
      route of administration of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) must be made.
      Although adding a progestogen to an ERT regimen is mandatory, particularly in a
      woman with an intact uterus, discussion now focuses on which progestogen least
      attenuates the beneficial effects of estrogen. Emerging trends suggest that lower
      doses of estrogen (i.e. ethinylestradiol 5 microg/day, estradiol 0.25 mg/day or
      conjugated estrogens [CEE] 0.3 mg/day) continuously combined with lower doses of 
      medroxyprogesterone (MPA) are equally effective at relieving vasomotor symptoms
      as the most commonly prescribed regimen in the US (CEE 0.625mg/MPA 2.5mg daily), 
      with fewer adverse events, leading to greater patient acceptance and likelihood
      for continuation of therapy. This is especially important when therapy is
      initiated at an older age.

TI  - Clinical equivalence of intranasal estradiol and oral estrogens for
      postmenopausal symptoms.
PG  - 143-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to demonstrate the equivalent efficacy of intranasal
      estradiol (Aerodiol Servier, Istanbul, Turkey) 300 mg/day relative to a standard 
      oral estradiol therapy of 2 mg/day and to assess the therapeutic value of the
      potential benefits of Aerodiol. METHODS: Two hundred and one postmenopausal women
      with severe menopausal symptoms were recruited to the trial. Women received
      either intranasal Aerodiol 300 microg/day (one spray delivery of 150 microg per
      nostril) or an oral estradiol 2 mg for 24 weeks. Severity of symptoms were
      compared based on the Kupperman index (KI) at the end of 24 weeks. RESULTS: The
      KI score decreased markedly in both groups between W0 and W24. At W24, the two
      treatments were shown to be statistically equivalent (P<0.001). The incidence of 
      adverse events was very similar in both groups; those related to treatment were
      of mild or moderate intensity in 95% of cases for the nasal group and 90% for the
      oral group. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, pulsed estrogen therapy using Aerodiol is
      safe, easily used and highly efficient in alleviating postmenopausal symptoms
      with a dose of 300 microg. The dose of 300 microg in one administration per day
      offers the optimal therapy whilst being easily adaptable to each patient's
      clinical response.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of pulsed estrogen therapy: a 12-week double-blind
      placebo-controlled study in highly symptomatic postmenopausal women.
PG  - 249-58
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To confirm the efficacy and safety of pulsed estrogen therapy, a
      transient daily hormone exposure, for climacteric symptoms in highly symptomatic 
      postmenopausal women. Patients and methods: In this multicenter, double-blind,
      parallel-group study, early postmenopausal women with at least seven moderate to 
      severe vasomotor symptoms per day were randomized to receive intranasal
      estradiol, 150 or 300 microg/day, or placebo, for 12 weeks. The primary outcome
      measure was the mean daily number of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, as
      recorded in patient diaries. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients were randomized.
      The mean daily number of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms decreased
      significantly more (p < 0.001) in the 150-microg/day (-7.86) and 300-microg/day
      (-9.39) groups than in the placebo group (-5.22). The decrease reached
      significance more rapidly with the 300-microg/day dose (from week 2) than with
      the 150-microg/day dose (from week 8). The rate of emergent adverse events with
      both doses was similar to that with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Pulsed estrogen
      therapy, achieved by intranasal estradiol 150 microg/day and 300 microg/day,
      significantlyreduced the incidence of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms,
      compared with placebo. The 300-microg/day dose demonstrated a greater and more
      rapid therapeutic effect, with no clinically significant difference in
      tolerability, compared with the 150-microg/day dose, and therefore offers the
      best efficacy/safety ratio when initiating treatment with intranasal estradiol.

TI  - Effects of oral dehydroepiandrosterone on bone density in young women with
      anorexia nervosa: a randomized trial.
PG  - 4935-41
AB  - Young women with anorexia nervosa (AN) have subnormal levels of
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and estrogen that may be mechanistically linked to 
      the bone loss seen in this disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the 
      effects of a 1-yr course of oral DHEA treatment vs. conventional hormonal
      replacement therapy (HRT) in young women with AN. Sixty-one young women were
      randomly assigned to receive oral DHEA (50 mg/d) or HRT (20 micro g ethinyl
      estradiol/0.1 mg levonorgestrel). Anthropometric, nutrition, and exercise data
      were acquired every 3 months, and bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition
      were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) every 6 months over 1 yr.
      Serum samples were obtained for measurements of hormones, proresorptive
      cytokines, and bone formation markers, and urine was collected for determinations
      of bone resorption markers at each visit. In initial analyses, total hip BMD
      increased significantly and similarly (+1.7%) in both groups. Hip BMD increases
      were positively correlated with increases in IGF-I (r = 0.44; P = 0.030) and the 
      bone formation marker, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase increased significantly
      only in the DHEA treatment group (P = 0.003). However, both groups gained
      significant amounts of weight over the year of therapy, and after controlling for
      weight gain, no treatment effect was detectable. There was no significant change 
      in lumbar BMD in either group. Both bone formation markers, bone-specific
      alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, increased transiently at 6-9 months in
      those subjects receiving DHEA compared with the estrogen-treated group (P <
      0.05). Both DHEA and HRT significantly reduced levels of the bone resorption
      markers, urinary N-telopeptides (P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation
      between changes in IGF-I and changes in weight, body fat determined by DXA, and
      estradiol for both groups. In addition, patients receiving DHEA exhibited
      improvement on three validated psychological instruments (Eating Attitudes Test, 
      Anorexia Nervosa Subtest, and Spielberger Anxiety Inventory). Both DHEA and HRT
      had similar effects on hip and spinal BMD. Over the year of treatment,
      maintenance of both hip and spinal BMD was seen, but there was no significant
      increase after accounting for weight gain. Compared with HRT, DHEA appeared to
      have anabolic effects, evidenced by the positive correlation between increases in
      hip DXA measurements and IGF-I and significant increases in bone formation
      markers. Both therapies significantly decreased bone resorption. Replicating
      results from studies of the elderly, DHEA resulted in improvements in specific
      psychological parameters in these young women.

TI  - Effect of discontinuation of estrogen, calcitriol, and the combination of both on
      bone density and bone markers.
PG  - 4914-23
AB  - In a 5-yr randomized prospective study we examined the treatment effect of
      estrogen replacement therapy/hormone replacement therapy (ERT/HRT), calcitriol,
      ERT/HRT and calcitriol, or placebo for 3 yr and the effect of discontinuation of 
      therapy for 2 more yr on bone mineral density (BMD), calciotropic hormones,
      markers of bone remodeling, and calcium absorption in 489 elderly women. The
      treatment phase of the study was double-blinded. After discontinuing therapy for 
      2 yr, there was rapid bone loss in all 3 treatment groups, and most of the
      decrease in BMD occurred in the first year. In the ERT/HRT group, spine BMD
      increased 5.5% in yr 3, decreased 3.2% in yr 4, and decreased 0.7% in yr 5;
      femoral neck BMD increased 3.7% in yr 3, decreased 2.5% in yr 4, and decreased
      0.4% in yr 5; total body BMD increased 2.1% in yr 3, decreased 1.4% in yr 4, and 
      decreased 0.6% in yr 5. In the combination group, spine BMD increased 7.1% in yr 
      3, decreased 4.3% in yr 4, and decreased 0.3% in yr 5; femoral neck BMD increased
      4.5% in yr 3, decreased 3.0% in yr 4, and decreased 0.01% in yr 5; total body BMD
      increased 2.2% in yr 3, decreased 1.5% in yr 4, and decreased 0.6% in yr 5. In
      the calcitriol group, spine BMD increased 1.8% in yr 3, decreased 1.8% in yr 4,
      and showed no change in yr 5; femoral neck BMD increased 0.2% in yr 3, decreased 
      0.2% in yr 4, and decreased 0.6% in yr 5; total body BMD decreased 0.4% in yr 3, 
      decreased 0.6% in yr 4, and decreased 0.4% in yr 5. Compared with placebo, all
      treated groups at yr 5 had significantly higher total body BMD; only the
      combination group had significantly higher spine BMD (3.4%; P < 0.001) and total 
      hip BMD (2.4%; P < 0.01.) compared with the placebo group. Compared with
      baseline, only spine BMD in the combination group was significantly higher (2.6%;
      P < 0.001) at yr 5. The increase in calcium absorption and the decrease in serum 
      PTH levels in the calcitriol groups were reversed after discontinuation of
      treatment, and the decrease in bone markers was reversed in the hormone-treated
      groups. These results suggest that discontinuation of ERT/HRT and/or calcitriol
      therapy in elderly women leads to a decrease in much of the BMD gained on
      treatment; however, in the combination group there was a statistically
      significant residual effect on spine BMD.

TI  - The effect of micronized estradiol on bone turnover and calciotropic hormones in 
      older men receiving hormonal suppression therapy for prostate cancer.
PG  - 4907-13
AB  - To examine the effect of estradiol (E(2)) without the confounding effect of
      hypothalamic-pituitary feedback, we studied men with prostate cancer in whom
      gonadotropin secretion was suppressed by LH-releasing hormone agonists (LHRH-A). 
      Fourteen men over 65 yr of age and receiving established LHRH-A treatment (EST
      group) without bony metastases and 12 men who received LHRH-A as neoadjuvant
      therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer (NEO group) were randomized (double 
      blind) to receive either 1 mg/d micronized E(2) (n = 12) or placebo (PL; n = 13) 
      for 9 wk. E(2), estrone, testosterone, SHBG, PTH, and 25-hydroxy- and
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels as well as markers of bone resorption [N- and
      C-telopeptide cross-links (NTX and CTX) and deoxypyridinoline] and bone formation
      (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and N-terminal type I collagen)
      were measured before LHRH-A in the NEO group, before [baseline (BL)] and after 9 
      wk of E(2) or PL in all patients, and 6 wk after E(2) treatment in the EST group.
      In the NEO group, hormone levels fell 3 wk after the initial LHRH-A injection,
      and deoxypyridinoline increased significantly (P = 0.006). At BL, the EST group
      had higher bone turnover due to the longer duration of LHRH-A treatment. With
      E(2) treatment, E(2) levels rose into the normal male range, and two resorption
      markers decreased significantly from BL by 33% for NTX (P < 0.001) and 28% for
      CTX (P = 0.009). Bone formation markers did not change. PTH increased by 43% from
      BL (P < 0.01) in the E(2) group and decreased 16% from BL in the PL group (P <
      0.01). Ionized calcium did not change in the E(2) group, but increased in the PL 
      group by 2.3% (P < 0.01). NTX and CTX increased 6 wk after E(2) withdrawal in the
      EST group. We conclude that E(2) inhibits bone resorption in hypogonadal men
      through a direct skeletal effect that is independent of PTH. Low dose estrogen
      may be an option for the prevention and/or treatment of bone loss in this
      population.

TI  - [Postmenopausal hormonal treatment: conventional hormone replacement therapy or
      tibolone? Effects on bone].
PG  - 541-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to review with critical analysis, data from randomized
      controlled clinical trials comparing the effects on bone of conventional hormone 
      replacement therapy (HRT) and tibolone. Their respective effects on bone were
      also reviewed and summarized. Materials and methods. Medline via PubMed was
      searched using a combination of the following key words "tibolone, estrogens and 
      bone" to identify all randomized controlled trials tibolone versus HRT
      (1960-2001). RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials that have been carried out
      to compare effects of tibolone and conventional HRT on prevention of
      postmenopausal bone loss were identified. Only one of these trials has been
      performed with a correct methodology (double-blind and with an adequate
      duration). In this trial over 2 years, the highest significant increase from
      baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) at all sites was observed with HRT; in
      addition, HRT showed a significantly greater increase in BMD at lumbar spine than
      tibolone. Randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that tibolone
      produces positive effects on BMD. Nevertheless, no clinical convincing data are
      available to support its efficacy in the prevention of osteoporotic fractures.
      The positive impact on BMD of conventional HRT to prevent postmenopausal bone
      loss and to treat established osteoporosis has been shown by many randomized
      controlled trials. Regarding fracture risk prevention, some clinical and
      epidemiological data suggest that HRT initiated in early or late postmenopause
      may prevent fractures if it is administered at standard doses and continued for a
      long time. CONCLUSION: HRT is always the reference treatment of postmenopausal
      symptoms related to estrogen deficiency.

TI  - Hormone supplementation differently affects migraine in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 924-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of three schemes of oral hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) on migraine course in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Thirty-eight
      patients presenting for clinical evaluation of menopausal status and suffering
      from migraine were enrolled. The observational period lasted 7 months, during
      which women filled in a daily diary with the clinical features of headache
      attacks and analgesic use. We evaluated climacteric symptoms, anxiety and
      depression. After a 1-month run-in period, women were assigned to one of three
      regimens of HRT: estradiol hemihydrate 1 mg/day plus norethisterone 0.5 mg/day
      for 28 days, in a continuous combined scheme; oral conjugated estrogens 0.625
      mg/day for 28 days plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day in the last 14
      days, in a sequential continuous scheme; and estradiol valerate 2 mg/day for 21
      days plus cyproterone acetate 1 mg/day from day 12 to 21 in a sequential cyclical
      scheme. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: During
      the run-in period, the three subgroups of patients were similar as far as the
      features of migraine are concerned. Overall, a progressive increase in attack
      frequency (from 2.2 +/- 1.0 to 3.8 +/- 1.3, P<.001), days with headache (from 3.4
      +/- 1.3 to 4.9 +/- 1.9, P<.001), and analgesic consumption (from 3.4 +/- 1.3 to
      5.6 +/- 2.2, P<.001) was observed after 6 months. Duration of attacks decreased
      (from 18.1 +/- 7.4 to 13.6 +/- 4.2 hours, P =.005), whereas severity worsened
      (from 1.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2, P<.001). The increase in number of days with
      headache and number of analgesics used was smaller in the group receiving the
      continuous combined regimen than in the other two groups. CONCLUSION: Although
      HRT typically will lead to some worsening of headache syndrome, estradiol
      hemihydrate plus norethisterone given in a combined continuous scheme was the
      regimen best tolerated by our patients.

TI  - Comparison of high-dose finasteride (5 mg/day) versus low-dose finasteride (2.5
      mg/day) in the treatment of hirsutism.
PG  - 467-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of high-dose (5 mg/day)
      and low-dose (2.5 mg/day) finasteride in the treatment of hirsutism in women.
      DESIGN: A prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial. METHODS:
      Fifty-six hirsute women with moderate to severe hirsutism were prospectively
      evaluated to see the effects of low-dose (2.5 mg/day) and high-dose (5 mg/day)
      finasteride. Patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups. Group I
      (n=29) received 2.5 mg finasteride/day and group II (n=27) received 5 mg
      finasteride/day orally for 1 year. Hirsutism score, body mass index and hormonal 
      parameters (FSH, LH, estradiol, androstenedione, testosterone, free testosterone,
      17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and sex
      hormone-binding globulin) were measured in all the patients before treatment and 
      repeated at six-monthly intervals. RESULTS: The hirsutism scores decreased
      significantly at months 6 and 12 from a mean+/-s.d. of 18.4+/-4.6 to 13.3+/-5.2
      (P<0.001) and 18.4+/-4.6 to 8.6+/-4.2 (P<0.001) in group I and from 18.7+/-5.2 to
      13.9+/-5.3 (P<0.001) and 18.7+/-5.2 to 10.3+/-5.0 (P<0.001) in group II
      respectively. No significant changes in the blood chemistry and hormonal
      parameters except estradiol levels were observed. No serious side-effects were
      seen in the two groups. In group II, estradiol levels increased significantly at 
      6 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, hirsutism scores decreased
      significantly at 6 and 12 months in both groups I and II. Low-dose (2.5 mg/day)
      finasteride is safe and cost effective in the treatment of hirsutism and may be
      used instead of high-dose finasteride (5 mg/day) therapy.

TI  - Circulating estradiol and osteoprotegerin as determinants of bone turnover and
      bone density in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 4470-5
AB  - Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a recently identified cytokine that acts as a decoy
      receptor for the receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand. OPG has been shown to
      be an important inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation and activation in rodent 
      models. Estrogen is known to suppress bone resorption, and the action of estrogen
      on bone may be mediated by OPG. The relationship between endogenous estrogen and 
      circulating OPG levels and bone status in human populations is unclear. Thus, the
      aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between biochemical markers
      of bone turnover and bone density and circulating OPG and endogenous estradiol
      levels in a population-based cohort of postmenopausal women. Subjects were 180
      women ages 55-91 yr (mean age, 67 yr). Serum estradiol was measured using an
      auto-analyzer. Serum concentrations of OPG were determined by ELISA. Markers of
      bone formation and resorption were measured by standard methods. Bone mineral
      density at total body, total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine was measured by 
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. There was a significant inverse relationship
      between estradiol and all bone turnover markers (r-values from -0.46 to -0.23; P 
      < 0.05). Serum estradiol was positively related to absolute bone density at all
      sites and to change in bone density at the hip and femoral neck by univariate
      analysis (r-values from 0.15-0.29; P < 0.05). We observed a weak inverse
      association between OPG and serum-based bone turnover markers (r-values -0.18 and
      -0.16; P < 0.05). There was a significant positive relationship between OPG and
      bone mineral density at total body, total hip, and femoral neck (r-values from
      0.17-0.2; P < 0.05) by univariate analysis, which was lost after adjustment for
      age and body mass index. There was a significant weak positive relationship
      between circulating OPG and serum estradiol (r = 0.18; P < 0.02). We observed no 
      significant relationships between OPG and bone turnover markers measured in
      urine. We conclude that the variation in circulating endogenous estradiol levels 
      is an important factor contributing to levels of bone turnover and bone density
      at the menopause. Our observations also suggest that circulating levels of OPG
      may reflect OPG activity in bone and are related to circulating endogenous levels
      of estradiol. We have previously reported high levels of variability in urine
      markers of bone resorption, and we suggest that this could account for the
      absence of a significant association between these markers and circulating OPG.

TI  - An evaluation of bioequivalence of two 7-day 17beta-estradiol transdermal
      delivery systems by anatomical site.
PG  - 1134-41
AB  - An open-label, randomized, crossover study was conducted to assess the
      bioequivalence of two 7-day transdermal 17beta-estradiol delivery systems
      following application to the buttock in 42 postmenopausal women. The systems
      tested were a generic Estradiol Transdermal System (Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) 
      and Climara (Berlex Laboratories, Inc.), the reference product. Each system was
      labeled to deliver 17beta-estradiol 0.1 mg/day and was applied for 7 days. Serial
      serum samples were assayed for estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate using
      validated assays. The bioequivalence confidence intervals for the ratio of
      log-transformed 17beta-estradiol Cmax values for the Estradiol Transdermal System
      and Climara were outside the interval of 0.80 to 1.25, indicating that the
      products were not bioequivalent. Application site reactions and skin irritation
      were more common with the Estradiol Transdermal System than with Climara. The
      odds of patch lifting or detachment were 6.95 times higher with the Estradiol
      Transdermal System than with Climara. Because these two transdermal delivery
      systems had been previously shown to be bioequivalent after application to the
      abdomen, the findings of this study suggest that bioequivalence at one anatomical
      site is not indicative of bioequivalence at another.

TI  - Different effects of oral conjugated equine estrogen and transdermal estrogen
      replacement therapy on size and oxidative susceptibility of low-density
      lipoprotein particles in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 1771-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) has an antioxidant 
      effect that opposes the oxidation of LDL particles. Oral ERT-induced increases in
      plasma triglyceride, however, decrease LDL particle size, which may counteract
      this antioxidant effect. Because transdermal ERT decreases plasma triglyceride,
      it may not decrease LDL particle size and may preserve estrogen's antioxidant
      effect. The present study investigates whether transdermal ERT can eliminate the 
      adverse effects of oral ERT on the size and oxidative susceptibility of LDL in
      postmenopausal women. METHODS AND RESULTS: Postmenopausal women received no
      treatment (n=12) or were treated with either 0.625 mg oral conjugated equine
      estrogen daily (n=16) or with transdermal estradiol (50 microg/d, n=16) for 3
      months. Plasma lipids and the diameter of LDL particles were determined.
      Susceptibility of LDL to oxidation was analyzed by incubation with CuSO4 and
      subsequent measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS)
      concentrations. Oral ERT significantly increased plasma triglyceride and
      decreased LDL diameter but did not affect LDL-derived TBARS concentrations. In
      contrast, transdermal ERT significantly decreased the concentrations of plasma
      triglyceride and LDL-derived TBARS and significantly increased LDL diameter.
      Estrogen-induced changes in LDL diameter correlated negatively with changes in
      plasma triglyceride (r=-0.51, P<0.001) and LDL-derived TBARS (r=-0.50, P<0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Because transdermal, but not oral ERT, decreases plasma triglyceride
      and produces larger LDL particles that are resistant to oxidation, the
      antioxidant effect of estrogen can be preserved.

TI  - Long-term use of contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate in young women
      impairs arterial endothelial function assessed by cardiovascular magnetic
      resonance.
PG  - 1646-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) inhibits proliferation of
      ovarian follicles, resulting in anovulation and a decrease in circulating
      estrogen; the latter action is potentially disadvantageous to cardiovascular
      health. We therefore investigated the vascular effects of long-term contraceptive
      DMPA in young women. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endothelium-dependent
      (hyperemia-induced flow-mediated dilatation [FMD]) and -independent (glyceryl
      trinitrate [GTN]) changes in brachial artery area were measured using
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance in 13 amenorrheic DMPA users (>1 year use; mean
      age 29+/-4 years) and in 10 controls (mean age 30+/-4 years, P=0.25) with regular
      menstrual cycles after validation of the technique. FMD and GTN responses were
      measured just before repeat MPA injection and 48 hours later (n=12) in DMPA users
      and during menstruation and midcycle (n=9) in controls. Serum-estradiol levels
      (S-estradiol) were measured at both visits. FMD was reduced in DMPA users
      compared with controls during menstruation (1.1% versus 8.0%, respectively
      P<0.01) without differences in GTN responses. S-estradiol levels in DMPA users
      were significantly lower than in controls during menstruation (58 versus 96
      pmol/L, P<0.01). High levels of circulating MPA 48 hours after injection were not
      linked to an additional impairment in FMD (2.0% versus 3.1%, P=0.23). Estradiol
      levels were significantly correlated to FMD (r=0.43, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Endothelium-dependent arterial function measured by cardiovascular magnetic
      resonance is impaired in chronic users of DMPA, and hypoestrogenism may be the
      mechanism of action. DMPA might adversely affect cardiovascular health, and in
      particular its use in women with cardiovascular disease should be additionally
      evaluated.

TI  - Spotlight on rizatriptan in migraine.
PG  - 715-20
AB  - Rizatriptan is an orally active serotonin 5-HT(1) receptor agonist that potently 
      and selectively binds to 5-HT(1B/1D) subtypes. Earlier clinical trials
      demonstrated that rizatriptan 5 or 10mg is more effective than placebo at
      providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated symptoms of
      migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient quality of life,
      and showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea 
      to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recently, rizatriptan 10mg was
      shown to be more effective than zolmitriptan 2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at
      producing a pain-free state 2 hours postdose. Furthermore, compared with
      naratriptan, significantly more patients who received rizatriptan were pain free 
      or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. The number of patients with normal
      functional ability at 2 hours was significantly higher after rizatriptan than
      after naratriptan or zolmitriptan. Rizatriptan was also generally more effective 
      than zolmitriptan or naratriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms.
      Rizatriptan is generally well tolerated, and adverse events are usually mild and 
      transient. The most common adverse events associated with rizatriptan in recent
      randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. There 
      was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan compared
      with zolmitriptan (31.2 vs 38.8%). However, rizatriptan was associated with a
      significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan (39 vs 29%).
      The incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of rizatriptan, 
      zolmitriptan or naratriptan (2-4%). In conclusion, rizatriptan is an effective
      drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. Oral rizatriptan 5
      and 10mg have shown greater efficacy than placebo in providing pain relief, an
      absence of pain, relief from associated symptoms, normal functional ability and
      an improvement in patient quality of life. Earlier results showed that
      rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater
      extent than oral sumatriptan. More recent studies have shown that rizatriptan
      10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage of patients with an
      absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than naratriptan 2.5mg
      or zolmitriptan 2.5mg. The efficacy of rizatriptan is retained when used in the
      long term, and the drug is generally well tolerated. Although well designed
      studies comparing rizatriptan with almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan would
      further define the position of rizatriptan, current data suggest that rizatriptan
      should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management of
      migraine.

TI  - Prospective randomised trial comparing diethylstilboestrol and flutamide in the
      treatment of hormone relapsed prostate cancer.
PG  - 431-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with hormone relapsed prostate cancer (HRPC) are often
      treated with flutamide or diethylstilboestrol. However, which of these two
      options is the best treatment for HRPC remains unclear. METHODS: We carried out a
      prospective study to determine and compare the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      response and survival in patients with hormone relapsed prostate cancer (HRPC),
      all of whom had previously shown a good response to medical or surgical
      castration. The patients were randomised to treatment with diethylstilboestrol
      (DES) and aspirin, or the antiandrogen flutamide. In addition, quality of life
      was determined by interview and questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients
      were randomised for treatment options. There was a significantly greater fall in 
      the PSA (65% vs 35%; P = 0.034) after treatment with diethylstilboestrol compared
      to treatment with flutamide. Median survival also rose after treatment with
      diethylstilboestrol (18 months) compared to flutamide (11 months), but this
      difference did not reach statistical significance. There was no difference in the
      quality of life parameters between the two groups. There were no cardiovascular
      complications in the stilboestrol group. CONCLUSIONS: In HRPC, treatment with
      stilboestrol is associated with a greater PSA fall and an increase in median
      survival when compared to flutamide treatment.

TI  - Effects of a standardized soy extract on hot flushes: a multicenter,
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 329-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of an oral soy isoflavone extract
      (Phytosoya) on hot flushes in menopausal women. DESIGN: The study was conducted
      on outpatients according to a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. A total of 75 patients in natural or
      surgical menopause suffering from at least seven hot flushes per day were
      randomized to receive during 4 months either soy isoflavone extract (total of 70 
      mg genistin and daidzin per day) or placebo. RESULTS: There is evidence to
      suggest that 16 weeks of treatment with soy extract can help reduce the mean
      number of hot flushes per 24 hours in menopausal women. Withdrawals during this
      trial made it difficult to obtain an unbiased estimate of the true treatment
      effect, but numerous sensitivity analyses lend support to the suggestion that
      taking soy extract can be beneficial in the treatment of hot flushes. In
      particular, women taking soy extract had a 38% reduction in the mean number of
      hot flushes by week 4 and a 51% reduction by week 8. By the end of week 16,
      patients taking soy extract had a 61% reduction in their daily hot flushes versus
      a 21% reduction obtained with the placebo. "Responders" (defined as patients
      whose hot flushes were reduced by at least 50% at the end of treatment period)
      were 65.8% in the soy extract group and 34.2% in the placebo group ( < 0.005).
      CONCLUSION: Soy isoflavone extract may help to reduce the frequency of hot
      flushes in climacteric women and provides an attractive addition to the choices
      available for relief of hot flushes.

PG  - 150-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cognitive effects of high-dose oral estrogen alone
      or in combination with oral methyltestosterone in postmenopausal women. METHODS: 
      Participants were tested with a randomized, double-blind design on the Identical 
      Pictures, Cube Comparisons, Building Memory and Shape Memory tasks before and
      after 4 months of hormone treatment. RESULTS: Women receiving estrogen and
      methyltestosterone maintained a steady level of performance on the Building
      Memory task, whereas those receiving estrogen alone showed a decrease in
      performance. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the addition of
      testosterone to high-dose estrogen replacement exerts a protective effect on
      memory performance in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Differential subjective effects of D-amphetamine by gender, hormone levels and
      menstrual cycle phase.
PG  - 729-41
AB  - Estrogen and progesterone interact with monoamines in ways that suggest the
      potential modulation of responses to psychoactive drugs by endogenous steroids,
      both between menstrual phases and between the sexes. The present study assessed
      the subjective and physiological effects of a single dose of D-amphetamine (AMPH;
      15 mg oral) in healthy, normally cycling women (n=13), who received amphetamine
      and placebo (PL) during both the follicular and luteal phases of a single
      menstrual cycle, and in healthy men (n=7). Females reported greater
      amphetamine-induced subjective stimulation [Addiction Research Center Inventory
      (ARCI)-A, ARCI-MBG; Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) Feel Drug, Feel High, Want
      More] during the follicular phase than the luteal phase. Within the follicular
      phase, the magnitude of individuals' AMPH-induced stimulation was positively
      associated with baseline (predrug) salivary estradiol [r=+.55-.78; Profile of
      Mood States (POMS) Vigor, Positive Mood, Elation], and negatively associated with
      salivary progesterone [r=-.66-.68; POMS Friendliness; Subjective States
      Questionnaire (SSQ) Pleasant Sedation]. Sex differences also emerged. Males
      reported feeling greater AMPH-induced stimulation (ARCI-A, ARCI-MBG; DEQ Feel
      Drug, Want More) than females in the luteal phase. Thus, higher levels of
      estrogen and lower levels of progesterone are associated with greater subjective 
      stimulation after AMPH in women, and these hormonal influences contribute to sex 
      differences in amphetamine responding.

PG  - 219-23
AB  - Although men do not experience an abrupt cessation of gonadal hormone production 
      at midlife as do women, levels of testosterone (T) decrease gradually with aging.
      Because estradiol (E2) arises mainly from the conversion of T in men, the
      availability of E2 also decreases with increasing age. In randomized clinical
      trials, E2 replacement therapy has been shown to maintain aspects of cognition in
      postmenopausal women, specifically with regard to verbal memory. The present
      prospective, randomized, cross-over trial is being undertaken in order to
      determine whether E2 will enhance verbal memory in men with Mild Cognitive
      Impairment (MCI). Men with MCI will randomly receive E2 or placebo for the first 
      3 mo of treatment and will then be crossed-over to the other treatment for an
      additional 3 mo. A battery of neuropsychological tests will be administered at
      pretreatment and, again, following each 3-mo treatment phase. It is hypothesized 
      that elderly men with MCI will perform better on tests of explicit memory when
      they are being treated with E2 compared to their performance under placebo
      conditions.

TI  - Effect of transdermal estradiol and oral conjugated estrogen on C-reactive
      protein in retinoid-placebo trial in healthy women.
PG  - 1224-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) during oral conjugated
      equine estrogen (CEE) may explain the initial excess of cardiovascular disease
      observed in clinical studies. Because the effect of transdermal estradiol (E2) on
      CRP is unclear, we compared CRP changes after 6 and 12 months of transdermal E2
      and oral CEE in a randomized 2x2 retinoid-placebo trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: A
      total of 189 postmenopausal women were randomized to 50 microg/d transdermal E2
      and 100 mg BID of the retinoid fenretinide (n=45), 50 microg/d transdermal E2 and
      placebo (n=49), 0.625 mg/d oral CEE and 100 mg BID fenretinide (n=46), or 0.625
      mg/d oral CEE and placebo (n=49) for 1 year. Sequential medroxyprogesterone
      acetate was added in each group. Relative to baseline, CRP increased by 10% (95% 
      CI -9% to 33%) and by 48% (95% CI 22% to 78%) after 6 months of transdermal E2
      and oral CEE, respectively. The corresponding figures at 12 months were 3% (95%
      CI -14% to 23%) for transdermal E2 and 64% (95% CI 38% to 96%) for oral CEE.
      Fenretinide did not change CRP levels at 6 and 12 months relative to placebo.
      Relative to oral CEE, the mean change in CRP after 12 months of transdermal E2
      was -48% (95% CI -85% to -7%, P=0.012), whereas fenretinide was associated with a
      mean change of -1% (95% CI -34% to 40%, P=0.79) compared with placebo.
      CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to oral CEE, transdermal E2 does not elevate CRP levels 
      up to 12 months of treatment. The implications for early risk of coronary heart
      disease require further studies.

TI  - Meta-analyses of therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis. V. Meta-analysis of
      the efficacy of hormone replacement therapy in treating and preventing
      osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 529-39
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on bone
      density and fractures in postmenopausal women. DATA SOURCE: We searched MEDLINE
      and EMBASE from 1966 to 1999, the Cochrane Controlled Register, citations of
      relevant articles, and proceedings of international meetings for eligible
      randomized controlled trials. We contacted osteoporosis investigators to identify
      additional studies, and primary authors for unpublished data. STUDY SELECTION: We
      included 57 studies that randomized postmenopausal women to HRT or a control
      (placebo or calcium/vitamin D) and were of at least 1 yr in duration. Seven of
      these studies reported fractures. DATA ABSTRACTION: For each study, three
      independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and abstracted the
      data. DATA SYNTHESIS: HRT showed a trend toward reduced incidence of vertebral
      fractures [relative risk (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-1.07; 5
      trials] and nonvertebral fractures (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71-1.08; 6 trials). HRT had
      a consistent effect on bone mineral density (BMD) at all sites. The difference
      between HRT and control in the percent change in bone density at 2 yr was 6.76
      (5.83, 7.89; 21 trials) at the lumbar spine and 4.53 (3.68, 5.36; 14 trials) and 
      4.12 (3.45, 4.80; 9 trials) at the forearm and femoral neck, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: HRT has a consistent, favorable and large effect on bone density at 
      all sites. The data show a nonsignificant trend toward a reduced incidence in
      vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.

TI  - A randomised, double-blind trial comparing raloxifene HCl and continuous combined
      hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women: effects on compliance and
      quality of life.
PG  - 874-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (ccHRT) and
      raloxifene with respect to compliance and quality of life, which were predefined 
      secondary endpoints of a large, prospective study designed to investigate the
      uterine effects of both treatments. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomised controlled
      trial of six-month duration. SETTING: One hundred and twenty-nine gynaecology
      hospital departments, clinics or practices specialised in women's healthcare,
      located in Europe, South Africa and Israel. POPULATION: Healthy postmenopausal
      women (n = 1008). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in quality of life using the
      Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) and compliance using a compliance
      questionnaire and pill count. Adverse event and early discontinuation rates and
      satisfaction with treatment using a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Women
      taking raloxifene reported greater satisfaction with their treatment as assessed 
      on the VAS (P = 0.004), and a lower proportion, as compared with ccHRT, reported 
      being worried by the treatment (9.6% vs 20.2%, P < 0.01). Women taking ccHRT
      reported greater deterioration in scores from the WHQ for depressed mood and
      menstrual symptoms than those taking raloxifene (P < 0.01). For memory, vasomotor
      symptoms and sexual behaviour, the ccHRT group reported significantly greater
      mean improvements (P < 0.05). Over half (58.8%) of those taking raloxifene
      noticed no effect, 37.7% felt better and 3.4% felt worse as measured using the
      compliance questionnaire. Fifty percent of the women taking ccHRT felt better,
      37.8% noticed no effect but over 10% felt worse. More women on raloxifene (94.6%)
      than on ccHRT (85.9%) reported that they were taking their double-blinded
      medication regularly (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A lower rate of adverse
      event-related discontinuations, the lack of negative effects on quality of life
      and a smaller proportion of women being worried by the drug treatment were
      associated with higher treatment satisfaction and better compliance in
      postmenopausal women taking ccHRT or raloxifene.

TI  - Efficacy of a low-dose oral contraceptive containing 20 microg of ethinyl
      estradiol and 100 microg of levonorgestrel for the treatment of moderate acne: A 
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 399-409
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne is a multifactorial disease in which androgens appear to play an
      important role. A low-dose oral contraceptive containing 20 microg of ethinyl
      estradiol and 100 microg of levonorgestrel (EE/LNG) has been shown to improve
      biochemical markers of androgenicity. Lowering bioavailable androgens may improve
      acne. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      a low-dose oral contraceptive containing 20 microg of EE and 100 microg of LNG
      for the treatment of moderate acne. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial, healthy female subjects (n = 371; >/=14 years 
      old) with regular menstrual cycles and moderate facial acne were randomly
      assigned to receive EE/LNG or placebo for 6 cycles of 28 days. Acne lesion counts
      and clinician global assessment were performed at the end of each cycle. Patient 
      self-assessments were collected and biochemical markers of androgenicity were
      also measured. RESULTS: At the end of the study, the number of inflammatory and
      total lesions was significantly lower with EE/LNG compared with placebo (P <.05).
      Patients in the EE/LNG group also had significantly better scores for clinician
      global and patient self-assessments than those in the placebo group (P <.05).
      Biochemical markers of androgenicity improved during EE/LNG treatment compared
      with placebo and baseline values. CONCLUSION: A low-dose oral contraceptive
      containing EE/LNG is effective and safe for the treatment of moderate acne.

TI  - Efficacy of a soy rich diet in preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis: the Menfis
      randomized trial.
PG  - 295-300
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of a soy rich diet and hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) on the main biomarkers of bone turnover and bone mineral density
      (BMD) at postmenopausal age. METHODS: 187 healthy asymptomatic postmenopausal
      women, aged 39-60, were recruited and randomized into a soy rich diet group, a
      HRT group, and a control group. Bone biomarkers and BMD were evaluated at
      baseline and after 6 months at the end of the study. RESULTS: Diet is not as
      effective as HRT in reducing the postmenopausal turnover; however diet stimulates
      bone osteoblastic activity, as evidenced by significant increase in osteocalcin
      concentrations. BMD decreases significantly only in the control group, but not in
      the intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that soy products could be
      effective in reducing the risk of osteoporosis in asymptomatic postmenopausal
      women, but our findings should be confirmed before recommending the diet as a
      valid alternative to HRT.

TI  - Intermittent progestin administration as part of hormone replacement therapy:
      long-term comparison between estradiol 1 mg combined with intermittent
      norgestimate and estradiol 2 mg combined with constant norethisterone acetate.
PG  - 654-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: To decrease exposure to progestin during hormone replacement therapy 
      (HRT), a novel oral regimen consisting of constant 17beta-estradiol (E2) daily
      plus intermittent norgestimate (NGM) has been developed. METHODS: A multicenter
      study compared the safety and efficacy of E2 1 mg daily plus intermittent NGM 90 
      micro g (3 days off, 3 days on) (n = 150) vs. a continuous oral dose of E2 2 mg
      plus norethisterone acetate (NETA) 1 mg (n = 172) daily, for a period of 2 years.
      Endometrial biopsies were performed at 1 and 2 years. Subjects recorded the
      occurrence of vasomotor symptoms, uterine bleeding, and adverse events on diary
      cards. RESULTS: At 2 years' follow-up, no subject had developed endometrial
      hyperplasia or cancer. Endometrial atrophy was seen in 75% of subjects using the 
      intermittent NGM regimen and in 78% of women using the constant NETA regimen.
      Both groups maintained a 96% reduction in vasomotor symptoms up to 2 years. The
      rates of bleeding and/or spotting showed no difference between the groups, and at
      2 years' follow-up, 73% of women in the intermittent NGM group and 83% of
      subjects in the constant NETA group were amenorrheic. There was a lower incidence
      of progestin-associated side-effects, such as abdominal discomfort, edema,
      painful bleeding episodes, and breast symptoms, with the intermittent progestin
      regimen vs. the constant progestin regimen. Intermittent NGM use was associated
      with an elevation in HDL- and HDL2-cholesterol, whereas constant NETA reduced
      these lipoproteins. CONCLUSIONS: The intermittent administration of a progestin, 
      such as NGM, provides a new, well-tolerated regimen to achieve endometrial
      safety, an adequate rate of amenorrhea, and effective reduction of vasomotor
      symptoms in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Anastrozole in the management of breast cancer.
PG  - 1329-39
AB  - Anastrozole (Arimidex, AstraZeneca) is a third-generation aromatase inhibitor
      which rapidly reduces oestradiol concentrations to below detectable levels. It is
      both potent and selective for the aromatase enzyme, with near-maximal suppression
      of serum oestrogens occurring at the clinical dose of 1 mg/day in postmenopausal 
      women with advanced breast cancer. Anastrozole has also been shown to be a potent
      suppressor of intratumoural oestrogens, with responses comparable to those in
      serum. The results of two large, identically designed, randomised trials in
      postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had progressed on tamoxifen 
      showed that oral anastrozole 1 mg/day produced a statistically significant
      survival advantage over megestrol acetate 40 mg q.i.d. The median duration of
      survival was 26.7 months for anastrozole versus 22.5 months for megestrol
      acetate. Anastrozole was as well-tolerated as megestrol acetate, while weight
      gain was significantly increased in the megestrol acetate group compared with the
      anastrozole group. In another Phase III clinical trial involving 1021
      postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, anastrozole showed a
      statistically significant advantage over tamoxifen in median time to progression 
      in a combined analysis of 611 patients who were known to be oestrogen receptor-
      or progesterone receptor-positive. Anastrozole was as well-tolerated as
      tamoxifen, with a low rate of withdrawals (2%) due to drug-related adverse
      events. In addition, anastrozole was associated with fewer thromboembolic events 
      and episodes of vaginal bleeding than tamoxifen. For women with hormone
      receptor-positive tumours who progress on tamoxifen, anastrozole is superior to
      megestrol acetate. In addition, anastrozole is a reasonable alternative to
      tamoxifen for first-line endocrine therapy of advanced breast cancer. Recent data
      confirm an emerging role for anastrozole as adjuvant therapy for primary breast
      cancer in postmenopausal patients. Anastrozole is also being investigated in the 
      neoadjuvant setting.

TI  - Fulvestrant, formerly ICI 182,780, is as effective as anastrozole in
      postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer progressing after prior
      endocrine treatment.
PG  - 3396-403
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of fulvestrant (formerly ICI
      182,780) and anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer
      progressing after prior endocrine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 
      451) with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive fulvestrant 250 mg as
      a once-monthly (one x 5 mL) intramuscular injection or an oral dose of
      anastrozole 1 mg in this open, parallel-group, multicenter trial. The primary end
      point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included objective
      response (OR) rates, defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 
      duration of response (DOR), and tolerability. RESULTS: Patients were followed for
      a median period of 14.4 months. In terms of TTP, fulvestrant was as effective as 
      anastrozole (hazard ratio, 0.98; confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.21; P =.84).
      Median TTP was 5.5 months for fulvestrant and 5.1 months for anastrozole. OR
      rates showed a numerical advantage for fulvestrant (20.7%) over anastrozole
      (15.7%) (odds ratio, 1.38; CI, 0.84 to 2.29; P =.20). Clinical benefit rates (CR 
      + PR + stable disease > or = 24 weeks) were 44.6% for fulvestrant and 45.0% for
      anastrozole. Median DOR was 14.3 months for fulvestrant and 14.0 months for
      anastrozole. Both treatments were well tolerated, with 3.2% and 1.3% of
      fulvestrant- and anastrozole-treated patients, respectively, withdrawn from
      treatment because of an adverse event. CONCLUSION: Fulvestrant was as effective
      as anastrozole. These data confirm that fulvestrant is an additional, effective, 
      and well-tolerated treatment for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women
      whose disease progressed on prior endocrine therapy.

TI  - Double-blind, randomized trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of
      fulvestrant versus anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast
      cancer progressing on prior endocrine therapy: results of a North American trial.
PG  - 3386-95
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of fulvestrant (formerly ICI
      182,780) with anastrozole in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients 
      whose disease progresses on prior endocrine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In
      this double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, postmenopausal patients
      were randomized to receive either an intramuscular injection of fulvestrant 250
      mg once monthly or a daily oral dose of anastrozole 1 mg. The primary end point
      was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included objective response
      (OR) rate, duration of response (DOR), and tolerability. RESULTS: Patients (n =
      400) were followed for a median period of 16.8 months. Fulvestrant was as
      effective as anastrozole in terms of TTP (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95.14% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.14; P =.43); median TTP was 5.4 months with fulvestrant 
      and 3.4 months with anastrozole. OR rates were 17.5% with both treatments.
      Clinical benefit rates (complete response + partial response + stable disease >
      or = 24 weeks) were 42.2% for fulvestrant and 36.1% for anastrozole (95% CI,
      -4.00% to 16.41%; P =.26). In responding patients, median DOR (from randomization
      to progression) was 19.0 months for fulvestrant and 10.8 months for anastrozole. 
      Using all patients, DOR was significantly greater for fulvestrant compared with
      anastrozole; the ratio of average response durations was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to
      1.67; P < 0.01). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Fulvestrant was
      at least as effective as anastrozole, with efficacy end points slightly favoring 
      fulvestrant. Fulvestrant represents an additional treatment option for
      postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer whose disease progresses on
      tamoxifen therapy.

TI  - Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF) versus hormonal ablation
      with leuprorelin acetate as adjuvant treatment of node-positive, premenopausal
      breast cancer patients: preliminary results of the TABLE-study (Takeda Adjuvant
      Breast cancer study with Leuprorelin Acetate).
PG  - 2325-32
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of leuprorelin acetate in adjuvant treatment in comparison to
      standard chemotherapy with CMF in premenopausal, estrogen-receptor-positive or
      unknown, node-positive patients with early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 2 years of hormone ablation
      with leuprorelin acetate 11.25 mg as a subcutaneous injection every three months 
      or six courses of CMF (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, methotrexate 40 mg/m2,
      fluorouracil 600 mg/m2, days 1 and 8, q 4 weeks). The primary study end-point was
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) after 2 years. Secondary end-points included
      overall survival, adverse events and hormonal suppression. RESULTS: Between 1995 
      and 1999, a total of 589 patients with breast cancer were randomized to treatment
      with leuprorelin acetate or CMF. The data of 227 patients were available for this
      first interim analysis. One hundred and ten and 117 patients were assigned to
      leuprorelin acetate and chemotherapy, respectively. Both treatment arms were well
      balanced for baseline characteristics. So far, no difference between the groups
      has emerged with respect to recurrence-free or overall survivaL Suppression of
      serum estradiol levels and menstruation was less marked in the CMF-group compared
      to the leuprorelin arm. The most common adverse events were low-grade hot
      flushes, weight gain and increased sweating in the leuprorelin-treated patients
      and alopecia, nausea and vomiting in the CMF-group. CONCLUSION: According to
      these preliminary results, ovarian suppression with leuprorelin acetate was as
      effective as standard chemotherapy for premenopausal women with
      hormone-sensitive, node-positive early breast cancer.

TI  - Six months of hormone replacement therapy does not influence muscle strength in
      postmenopausal women.
PG  - 225-31
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has positive effects
      on fracture incidence before any effects on bone mineral density can be
      demonstrated. This has been attributed to increased muscle strength by HRT. This 
      study was designed to evaluate the effect of 6 months of HRT on muscle strength
      in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women, aged 60-78 were
      included in the study. They were randomly divided in two groups with 20 women in 
      each group. One group received Menorest 50 microg/24 h (estradiol 4.3 mg) and
      Gestapuran 2.5 mg (medroxyprogesteron) daily and the other group received placebo
      treatment. The study was conducted as a double blinded, prospective and placebo
      controlled trial. Hand grip strength, isokinetic knee flexion and extention, and 
      physical activity were measured before treatment, after 3 and 6 months. Physical 
      activity was estimated using a classification system of physical activity. A
      JAMAR hydraulic hand dynamometer and a Cybex II dynamometer were used to evaluate
      muscle strength. RESULTS: Hand grip strength in the right hand, increased
      significantly in both groups (HRT P<0.001 and placebo P<0.01) and in the left
      hand in the HRT group (P<0.01). However, there were no differences in muscle
      strength between the two groups. There was no significant change in isokinetic
      knee flexion or extension after 6 months in either of the groups. The estimated
      physical activity increased slightly in the placebo group, but there was no
      significant difference compared to the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
      suggest that 6 months of HRT does not influence muscle strength in postmenopausal
      women.

TI  - Effect of methyl testosterone administration on plasma viscosity in
      postmenopausal women.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of mortality in
      women, with an incidence that increases after menopause, hence suggesting a
      cardioprotective role of oestrogen. Menopause also results in a decline in
      androgen levels with resulting symptoms of decreased libido and sexual
      dysfunction. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the treatment of
      postmenopausal women with androgens. However, no data are available on plasma
      viscosity and fibrinogen levels in postmenopausal women on combined
      oestrogen/androgen therapy. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group 16-week study evaluating the effects of methyltestosterone
      supplementation on plasma viscosity and fibrinogen levels in postmenopausal women
      already on oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT) for at least 3 months. Women 21
      years and older who were menopausal (natural or surgical) for at least 12 months 
      were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomized to (1) an oestrogen-only
      group taking 1.25 mg esterified oestrogen (E-group) and (2) an oestrogen plus
      methyltestosterone (1.25 mg esterified oestrogen and 2.5 mg methyltestosterone)
      group (EA-group). Progesterone was not administered during the study period and
      women with intact uteri were given medroxyprogesterone 10 mg daily for 14 days at
      the completion of the study. RESULTS: After 16 weeks of treatment, both groups
      had a significant increase in serum oestradiol levels from baseline. The levels
      of total oestrogen were significantly higher in the E-group compared to the
      EA-group (P < 0.001). There was a greater decrease in the LH and SHBG levels in
      the EA-group (P = 0.01). There was no difference in total testosterone; however, 
      free testosterone levels were significantly higher in the EA-group (P = 0.01). At
      the end of the study, there was a significant decrease in plasma viscosity only
      in the EA-group (P = 0.01). Fibrinogen levels increased in both the groups,
      reaching significance only in the EA-group (P = 0.006). Baseline weight, body
      mass index (BMI) and the duration of menopausal status did not have any
      significant impact on the changes in plasma viscosity or fibrinogen. Women in the
      EA-group showed significant reductions in total cholesterol (P = 0.009), high
      density lipoprotein (HDL) (P < 0.001) and triglyceride (TG) levels (P = 0.001).
      There was no significant change in these parameters in the E-group. CONCLUSION:
      This prospective study shows that the treatment of postmenopausal women on
      oestrogen with low-dose oral methyltestosterone results in a significant
      reduction in plasma viscosity. This lowering of plasma viscosity was achieved
      despite an increase in fibrinogen levels. Significant lowering of lipoproteins,
      especially TG levels, might have been responsible for this benefit. The
      combination regimen did not result in major side-effects. Based on these results,
      we feel confident in recommending low-dose androgens to postmenopausal women with
      a history of sexual dysfunction and decreased libido.

TI  - Spotlight on ziprasidone in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 645-52
AB  - Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic agent with a pharmacological profile
      distinct from that of other currently available novel or classical
      antipsychotics. In preclinical studies, ziprasidone was predicted to have
      efficacy against positive, negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia with 
      a favourable tolerability profile, including a low propensity to induce
      extrapyramidal adverse effects. The drug has been administered orally to >300
      patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder 
      in published 4- to 6-week randomised, double-blind trials. When given twice daily
      at dosages of between 80 and 160 mg/day, ziprasidone produced significantly
      greater improvements in overall symptomatology than placebo. In the largest
      study, ziprasidone 80 or 160 mg/day was also significantly more effective than
      placebo in reducing negative symptoms and, at 160 mg/day, was significantly more 
      effective than placebo in improving depressive symptoms in patients with
      associated clinically significant depression. Data from a 4-week trial indicate
      that ziprasidone 160 mg/day has similar efficacy to haloperidol 15 mg/day.
      Ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day was more effective than placebo with respect to
      prevention of impending relapse and improvement of negative symptoms in 294
      stable patients with chronic schizophrenia who were treated for up to 1 year. In 
      addition, significantly more ziprasidone than haloperidol recipients achieved a
      negative symptom response in a 28-week study involving 301 stable patients with
      chronic or subchronic schizophrenia. In general, oral ziprasidone is well
      tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to placebo.
      Importantly, the drug has a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a
      negligible effect on bodyweight. Ziprasidone is associated with slight
      prolongation of the QTc interval; the clinical significance of this is not yet
      clear. The drug does not appear to be associated with sustained elevation of
      plasma prolactin levels. Preliminary data indicate that long-term oral
      ziprasidone treatment is well tolerated. Ziprasidone is the only novel
      antipsychotic currently available in a rapid-acting intramuscular formulation.
      Short-term treatment with intramuscular ziprasidone was effective and well
      tolerated in patients with acute agitation associated with psychosis. In
      addition, intramuscular ziprasidone reduced agitation scores by a significantly
      greater extent than haloperidol in a study involving patients with acute
      agitation associated with psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Ziprasidone is a promising new 
      antipsychotic that has shown significant efficacy in the oral treatment of
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The drug is well
      tolerated with a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a negligible
      effect on bodyweight. In addition, intramuscular ziprasidone shows efficacy and
      good tolerability in the treatment of acute agitation associated with psychotic
      disorders.

TI  - Intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone versus oral megestrol for the control of 
      postmenopausal hot flashes in breast cancer patients: a randomized study.
PG  - 883-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hot flashes are frequent in postmenopausal breast cancer patients,
      especially when treated with tamoxifen. Estrogen replacement therapy is the most 
      effective treatment for hot flashes, but its use is controversial in breast
      cancer survivors. Progestins may offer a good alternative for the control of hot 
      flashes in this setting; in particular, oral megestrol acetate has been proven
      effective in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. With the aim of
      further improving these results, we have designed a randomized study comparing
      oral megestrol acetate with depot intramuscular (i.m.) medroxyprogesterone
      acetate (MPA) for the control of hot flashes in postmenopausal patients with a
      history of breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one postmenopausal
      patients were randomized to receive an i.m. injection of depot MPA 500 mg on days
      1, 14 and 28, or oral megestrol acetate 40 mg daily for 6 weeks. Patients
      recorded daily the number and severity of their hot flashes; response was defined
      as a > or =50% decrease in the number and severity of hot flashes. RESULTS: At
      week 6, hot flashes were reduced by 86% on average in the whole group of
      patients, without significant differences between the two progestins. Response
      was obtained by 75 and 67% of patients receiving MPA or megestrol, respectively
      (P = 0.5). Responders were followed to assess maintenance of response (without
      further treatment), which was significantly better with i.m. MPA: in this group, 
      89% of responders still showed a benefit at week 24, compared with 45% in the
      megestrol group (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that a short cycle of
      i.m. depot MPA injections provides significant and long-lasting relief from
      postmenopausal hot flashes in patients with a history of breast cancer, offering 
      an alternative to estrogen replacement therapy or prolonged administration of
      oral megestrol.

TI  - A pilot study of the effects of phytoestrogen supplementation on postmenopausal
      endometrium.
PG  - 238-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess endometrial histology in
      postmenopausal women not taking hormone replacement therapy, to evaluate side
      effects and efficacy of phytoestrogens in treating menopause-associated symptoms,
      and to determine whether 6 months of phytoestrogen supplementation altered
      endometrial histology. METHODS: We performed a prospective, double-blinded,
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing the effects of 6 months of dietary
      phytoestrogen supplementation versus placebo in postmenopausal women. Baseline
      endometrial biopsies were performed and, if adequate, nonhyperplastic,
      noncancerous, and nonovulatory, subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily 
      placebo or soy cereal supplementation for 6 months. Study subjects completed
      baseline and weekly dietary, symptom, and side effect logs. Repeat endometrial
      biopsies were obtained at 6 months. RESULTS: Subjects were recruited from January
      1998 through June 2000. Twenty-seven subjects were randomized, and 19 completed
      the study. One (3.7%) baseline endometrial sample was weakly proliferative. All
      other baseline and final biopsies were consistent with atrophic, inactive
      endometrium. The maximum risk of endometrial stimulation with phytoestrogens is
      35%. Hot flushes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness were significantly less
      severe at the final week of the study compared with baseline in the placebo
      group. Insomnia was more common in the treated group. There were no other
      statistically significant differences in symptoms or side effects. CONCLUSION:
      Phytoestrogens did not cause stimulation of the endometrium. Insomnia was more
      frequent over the 6-month study in the soy group, whereas hot flushes, night
      sweats, and vaginal dryness improved from baseline in the placebo group but not
      in the soy group.

TI  - Relation of sex hormones to bone mineral density in middle-aged men during a 4
      year exercise intervention trial.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - Recent studies have emphasized the symbiotic role of estradiol and testosterone
      on bone metabolism. Several anthropomorphic-, lifestyle-, and dual-energy X-ray
      (DXA)-derived parameters were measured with respect to estradiol (E(2)),
      testosterone (T), free T (fT), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in 140 men
      (aged 53-62 years) participating in a controlled, randomized exercise
      intervention trial. After 4 years of intervention, 132 (94.3%) men remained as
      participants. During the period of study, aerobic threshold increased
      significantly in the exercise intervention group compared with the reference
      group (13.4% vs. -1.9%: p < 0.023). Serum E(2) and fT were not convincingly
      related to bone mineral density (BMD) or BMD change. Aerobic threshold or the
      change in aerobic threshold were not associated with sex hormone or SHBG levels. 
      Body mass index was a significant determinant of T (beta = -0.337), fT (beta =
      -0.293), and SHBG (beta = -0.306), and smoking predicted T (beta = 0.231) and fT 
      (beta = 0.245). Alcohol intake was a significant determinant of E(2) (beta =
      0.213). Ultimately there was no convincing relation between sex hormone levels
      and BMD or BMD change in middle-aged men.

TI  - Cognitive effects of short-term manipulation of serum sex steroids in healthy
      young men.
PG  - 3090-6
AB  - We examined the effects of sex steroids on cognitive functioning by exogenously
      manipulating circulating T levels in a group of healthy young men. Thirty-two men
      were randomized to receive 8 wk of treatment including: 1) im T enanthate 100
      mg/wk plus daily oral placebo (T); 2) im placebo/wk plus 125 microg daily oral
      levonorgestrel (LNG); 3) im T enanthate 100 mg/wk plus 125 microg daily oral LNG 
      (T + LNG); 4) im placebo/wk plus daily oral placebo. Cognitive functions were
      assessed at baseline and twice during treatment. Serum T and E2 levels were
      significantly increased in the T and T + LNG groups compared with baseline (P <
      0.01) and T levels were significantly decreased in the LNG group (P < 0.05).
      Verbal memory significantly decreased in the LNG group (P < 0.01) and was
      maintained by coadministration of T in the T + LNG group. Divided attention was
      unaffected in the LNG group but improved significantly in the T + LNG group. In
      summary, decreased serum T levels induced by LNG or direct effects of the
      progestin, LNG, adversely affects verbal memory in normal young men. These
      results suggest that short-term changes in sex steroid levels have effects on
      cognitive function in healthy young men.

TI  - Levetiracetam does not alter the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive in
      healthy women.
PG  - 697-702
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate whether levetiracetam, a novel
      antiepileptic drug (AED), influences the pharmacokinetics of steroid oral
      contraceptives. METHODS: During a run-in phase, 18 healthy female patients
      received an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol, 0.03 mg, and
      levonorgestrel, 0.15 mg, for the first 21 days of two consecutive menstrual
      cycles. In a subsequent double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover treatment
      phase, subjects received either levetiracetam, 500 mg, or placebo twice daily
      concomitant with the oral contraceptive. Plasma concentrations of ethinyl
      estradiol and levonorgestrel were measured on days 14 and 15 of the two treatment
      periods for the evaluation of the 24-h kinetic parameters, and an additional
      sample was collected on day 21 to determine the trough plasma concentrations.
      Serum progesterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were determined on days
      13, 14, 15, and 21 of each cycle of the treatment phase. RESULTS: The plasma
      concentration-time curves and pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol and
      levonorgestrel were not statistically different during concomitant treatment with
      either levetiracetam or placebo. The ratios of the log-transformed geometric mean
      areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs), maximal (Cmax) and
      minimal (Cmin) plasma concentrations, and trough concentrations on day 21 (C21)
      ranged from 99.12 to 99.96% for ethinyl estradiol and from 97.13 to 99.41% for
      levonorgestrel. The 90% confidence intervals of these ratios were well within the
      80 to 125% acceptance range for lack of interaction. Serum progesterone and LH
      concentrations were fairly constant during the run-in and treatment phases and
      remained markedly below their respective physiologic levels. Safety and
      menstrual-bleeding patterns were comparable during levetiracetam and placebo
      administration. CONCLUSIONS: Levetiracetam does not affect the pharmacokinetics
      of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, and on 
      the basis of serum progesterone and LH levels, it does not affect the
      contraceptive efficacy.

TI  - Estrogen therapy and noncognitive psychiatric signs and symptoms in elderly
      patients with dementia.
PG  - 1225-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy and safety of short-term estrogen
      therapy in decreasing noncognitive signs and symptoms of dementia in demented
      elderly patients. METHOD: Sixteen moderately to severely demented elderly
      patients with aggressive behavioral disturbances were randomly assigned to
      receive conjugated equine estrogens or placebo in a 4-week clinical trial.
      Frequency and severity of noncognitive signs and symptoms of dementia, as
      assessed with the Dementia Signs and Symptoms Scale, were compared between
      estrogen and placebo groups. Data were analyzed with intent-to-treat and
      regression modeling methods. RESULTS: Estrogen therapy was associated with a
      significantly greater improvement on the Dementia Signs and Symptoms Scale total 
      score than placebo. All five Dementia Signs and Symptoms Scale subscale
      comparisons favored estrogen therapy. No adverse effects were observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that short-term estrogen therapy may 
      safely decrease the frequency and severity of noncognitive signs and symptoms of 
      dementia in elderly patients.

PG  - 253-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the mood and somatic effects during the initial 2 months of
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or progesterone combined with conjugated equine
      estrogen (CEE) in early postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Twenty-three nondepressed, 
      early postmenopausal women (average age, 52.5 years) completed a 91-day,
      single-blind pilot study with the following sequence of treatments: 1 week of no 
      substance; 2 weeks of placebo; 2 weeks of progestogen only; 1 week of placebo;
      and 2 months of "standard hormone replacement therapy cycles," which consisted of
      (in order) 2 weeks of 0.625 mg CEE, 2 weeks of CEE plus progestogen, 2 weeks of
      CEE, and 2 weeks of CEE plus progestogen. Ten women who completed the study
      received MPA (5 mg/day) as their progestogen, and 13 who completed the study
      received micronized, oil-suspended progesterone (200 mg/day) as their
      progestogen. All participants made daily assessments of mood using the Profile of
      Mood States and daily recordings of somatic symptoms. All subjects had plasma
      follicle-stimulating hormone of greater than 35 IU/L and had not had spontaneous 
      vaginal bleeding for more than 1 year. RESULTS: None of the hormone treatments
      had a detectable effect on mood. MPA users reported more vaginal bleeding and
      breast tenderness than progesterone users. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with the
      widely held belief among psychiatrists that progesterone depresses mood, neither 
      of the progestogens we used in normal, nondepressed and nonanxious women showed
      this effect. Absence of an effect on mood was also found when the results of the 
      two progestogens were combined. The lesser side effects of the micronized
      progesterone-containing regimen suggest that some women may prefer it to an
      MPA-containing regimen.

PG  - 227-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a pharmacologically induced, temporary
      suppression of ovarian hormones on healthy young women's cognitive functioning.
      DESIGN: Sixteen healthy women with normal menstrual cycles completed the
      California Verbal Learning Test, a digit span test, and a verbal fluency test in 
      the follicular phase of a normal menstrual cycle and a second time after four
      monthly injections of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. Women
      were randomly assigned to complete a third testing either after resuming cycles
      in the follicular phase or after three more injections of the GnRH agonist and
      while wearing an estradiol patch. The control group consisted of 10 women who
      were tested three times in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycles.
      RESULTS: Results showed no change in cognitive functioning across sessions or
      groups in women with suppressed ovarian function. Women who had the highest
      levels of menopausal symptoms when taking the GnRH agonist did not have
      significantly lower cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find
      any effect of suppression in ovarian hormones on cognitive performance of young
      women.

TI  - Novel treatment of delayed male puberty with aromatase inhibitors.
PG  - 44-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the evidence for the role of oestrogens in epiphyseal closure
      appears unequivocal, we hypothesized that boys with constitutional delay of
      puberty would attain greater adult height if oestrogen action was suppressed.
      METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in
      which we treated boys with constitutional delay of puberty with testosterone plus
      placebo or testosterone plus a potent fourth-generation aromatase inhibitor,
      letrozole. FINDINGS: Letrozole effectively inhibited oestrogen synthesis. The
      17beta-oestradiol concentrations increased in the untreated group and in the
      testosterone/placebo-treated group, but in the testosterone/letrozole-treated
      group no such increase was observed until letrozole treatment was discontinued.
      Testosterone concentrations were threefold higher in the
      testosterone/letrozole-treated group than in the other groups. Within 18 months, 
      bone age had advanced by 1.1 +/- 0.3 years in the untreated group and by 1.7 +/- 
      0.3 years in the testosterone/placebo-treated group, but only by 0.9 +/- 0.2
      years in the testosterone/letrozole-treated group (p = 0.02 between treatment
      groups). Predicted adult height did not change significantly in the untreated
      group and in the testosterone/placebo-treated group, whereas in the
      testosterone/letrozole-treated group the increase was 5.1 +/- 1.2 cm (p = 0.004).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, if oestrogen action is inhibited in
      growing adolescents, adult height will increase. This observation provides a
      rationale for studies aimed at delaying bone maturation in several growth
      disorders.

TI  - Endometrial safety of a transdermal sequential estradiol-levonorgestrel
      combination.
PG  - 170-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 1-year, randomized, multinational, open-label study
      was to assess the effect on the endometrium of three dosages of estradiol and
      sequential levonorgestrel, each administered in a novel 7-day transdermal matrix 
      patch. METHODS: A total of 468 postmenopausal women received patches of 15 cm2
      (50 micrograms/day estradiol for 2 weeks followed by 50 micrograms/day
      estradiol-10 micrograms/day levonorgestrel for 2 weeks), 22.5 cm2 (75
      micrograms/day estradiol for 2 weeks followed by 75 micrograms/day estradiol-15
      micrograms/day levonorgestrel for 2 weeks) or 30 cm2 (100 micrograms/day
      estradiol for 2 weeks followed by 100 micrograms/day estradiol-20 micrograms/day 
      levonorgestrel for 2 weeks). Each patch was applied for 7 days. RESULTS:
      Endometrial biopsies were taken before and after 1 year of treatment, with final 
      valid biopsy results being obtained in 399 women. There were two cases of
      endometrial hyperplasia (one in the 22.5-cm2 and one in the 30-cm2 group). All
      three doses of this 7-day sequential combined estradiol-levonorgestrel
      transdermal hormone replacement therapy therefore had excellent endometrial
      safety. The lowest dose, however, was associated with less bleeding and a
      somewhat different histological pattern, compared with the two higher doses. All 
      three doses provided a high level of patient satisfaction with the bleeding
      response. CONCLUSION: Estradiol and sequential levonorgestrel administered in a
      7-day transdermal matrix patch for 1 year provide endometrial protection.

TI  - Long-term effects of nutrient intervention on markers of bone remodeling and
      calciotropic hormones in late-postmenopausal women.
PG  - 1114-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D reduce bone loss and
      fracture risk in the elderly. Other nutrients also affect bone health, and
      adequate intakes may influence bone turnover and balance. OBJECTIVE: We compared 
      the long-term effects on bone turnover markers and calciotropic hormones of a
      multinutrient supplement, a calcium and vitamin D supplement, and dietary
      instruction aimed at increasing calcium intake through foods. DESIGN: Ninety-nine
      healthy postmenopausal women participated in a 3-y, randomized trial, receiving
      either 1) supplemental calcium (1450 mg/d) and vitamin D [10 microg (400 IU)/d], 
      2) calcium, vitamin D, and other nutrients (multinutrient supplement), or 3)
      dietary instruction (dietary control group). Data are from 83 subjects who
      completed the trial. RESULTS: Increases over baseline in calcium intakes and
      serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were sustained over 3 y in all treatment
      groups. Circulating parathyroid hormone concentrations were reduced at year 1 in 
      all treatment groups but trended toward baseline thereafter. Bone turnover
      markers followed a similar pattern, and none of the changes in biochemical
      concentrations differed significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS: All 3
      interventions offer long-term feasibility for increasing calcium intake and serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. The dietary addition of micronutrients
      implicated in skeletal physiology confers no obvious bone-sparing effect in
      healthy postmenopausal women beyond that of calcium and vitamin D alone. The
      attenuation over time in suppression of parathyroid hormone and bone turnover
      might help explain why nutrient intervention tends to have less of a bone-sparing
      effect than do skeletally active medications such as estrogen or bisphosphonates.

TI  - Relation of estrogen receptor-alpha gene polymorphism and hormone replacement
      therapy to fall risk and muscle strength in early postmenopausal women.
PG  - 64-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several factors may increase fracture risk, among them reduced bone
      mineral density (BMD), increased bone resorption, microarchitectural
      deterioration of bone, increased fall risk, and decreased muscle strength. We
      have previously reported that PvuII polymorphism of the estrogen receptor-alpha
      (ER alpha) gene is associated with bone loss rate, fracture risk, and response to
      hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in early postmenopausal Finnish women. METHOD: 
      We studied the influence of the ER alpha genotype on fall risk and muscle
      strength in a 5-year randomized HRT trial of 331 early postmenopausal women
      (subgroup of the population-based OSTPRE study, Kuopio, Finland). A 5-year postal
      inquiry in May 1994 included questions on falls during the previous 12 months.
      Grip strength was measured with dynamometer. The ER alpha gene polymorphism was
      analysed using PCR and PvuII restriction enzyme digestion. RESULTS. In all, 97
      out of the 331 women reported falls. Half of those (56%) were slip falls, mostly 
      during the winter season. In the HRT group, the ER alpha genotype was associated 
      with fall risk (P = 0.002, logistic regression). The risk of falls (RR) was
      higher in women with the PP genotype than in those with the Pp (RR = 5.26, 95% CI
      1.98-13.94, P = 0.001) or the pp (RR = 3.84, 95% CI 1.46-10.12, P = 0.007)
      genotype. When the falls were divided into slip (environment-related) and
      non-slip (endogenous) falls, the non-slip falls were associated with the genotype
      (P = 0.004), but the slip falls were not so clearly (P = 0.061). When all falls
      and non-slip falls were adjusted to the number of chronic health disorders and
      the variable time-since-menopause, the difference between the genotypes persisted
      (P = 0.003 and P = 0.010, respectively). In the non-HRT group, the ER alpha
      genotype was not associated with fall risk. The baseline or the 5-year grip
      strength values were not influenced by the ER alpha genotype. In conclusion, ER
      alpha polymorphism is associated with fall risk, especially with non-slip falls, 
      in early postmenopausal Finnish women during the HRT. We have previously reported
      that, during HRT, women with the P allele have decreased fracture risk and that
      they may preferentially derive benefit from the positive effect of HRT on BMD.
      This suggests that the influence of ER alpha polymorphism may depend on the
      target tissue (bone versus the nervous system). CONCLUSIONS: In these early
      postmenopausal, non-osteoporotic and relatively healthy women, the increased fall
      risk associated with the PP genotype was not associated with increased fracture
      risk, possibly due to improved bone strength during the HRT although falls
      generally predispose to fractures.

TI  - Randomized, double-masked, 2-year comparison of tibolone with 17beta-estradiol
      and norethindrone acetate in preventing postmenopausal bone loss.
PG  - 241-8
AB  - In this 2-year, randomized study, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of
      tibolone 2.5 mg (n = 75), tibolone 1.25 mg (n = 76) and estradiol 2 mg plus
      norethindrone acetate 1 mg (E2/NETA: n = 74) for preventing bone loss in
      postmenopausal women. Bone mineral density (BMD), measured by dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry, and bone remodeling markers were assessed every 6 months.
      Side-effects were assessed quarterly. After 24 months, the mean increase (+/- SD)
      in lumbar spine BMD from baseline was 3.6% +/- 2.9%, 1.9% +/- 3.5% and 6.8% +/-
      4.5% in the tibolone 2.5 mg, tibolone 1.25 mg and E2/NETA groups, respectively.
      All pairwise differences were significant. The proportion of responders (women
      with a change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD of > or = -2% after 2 years) was 
      95.7%, 89.0% and 98.5% with tibolone 2.5 mg, tibolone 1.25 mg and E2/NETA,
      respectively. Similar results were obtained for femoral BMD, although the
      difference between tibolone 2.5 mg and E2/NETA was not significant at 24 months. 
      Decreases in bone remodeling markers were similar in the three groups. Vaginal
      bleeding was more common in the E2/ NETA group (33.8%) than with tibolone 2.5 mg 
      (12.0%) or tibolone 1.25 mg (9.2%), as was breast pain (23.0%, 2.7% and 2.6%,
      respectively). Each treatment effectively prevented bone loss. Overall,
      tolerability of tibolone was better than with E2/NETA, because of less frequent
      vaginal bleeding and breast pain. This may promote long-term adherence.

TI  - Prolonged GnRH agonist and add-back therapy for symptomatic endometriosis:
      long-term follow-up.
PG  - 709-19
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess post-treatment effects in endometriosis patients of a
      12-month course of GnRH agonist alone or with one of three "add-back" regimens.
      METHODS: This is a post-treatment follow-up analysis of a randomized,
      double-masked, placebo-controlled 52-week trial. All patients had received
      monthly leuprolide acetate and were randomized to one of four groups: A-daily
      placebo; B-daily norethindrone acetate 5 mg; C-daily norethindrone acetate 5 mg
      and conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg; and D-daily norethindrone acetate 5 mg 
      and conjugated equine estrogens 1.25 mg. Of 201 patients enrolled in the initial 
      trial, 123 completed at least 280 days of therapy and entered the follow-up
      period. Physical findings and symptoms were quantified, and lumbar spine bone
      mineral density was determined at intervals for up to 12 and 24 months
      post-therapy. RESULTS: Symptom and pelvic examination scores remained
      significantly below baseline for at least 8 months after completion of therapy
      for all four groups (P <.05). Findings were not affected by endometriosis scores 
      noted on screening laparoscopy. Mean bone mineral density values remained at or
      above baseline in all add-back groups. The significant mean loss in bone density 
      in group A during therapy reversed slowly and had not returned to baseline at the
      final follow-up visit (P <.001). CONCLUSION: GnRH agonist and norethindrone
      acetate alone or combined with low-dose conjugated equine estrogens administered 
      to symptomatic endometriosis patients for 12 months provides extended pain relief
      and bone mineral density preservation after completion of therapy.

TI  - A randomized, open-label study of conjugated equine estrogens plus
      medroxyprogesterone acetate versus tibolone: effects on symptom control, bleeding
      pattern, lipid profile and tolerability.
PG  - 60-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of continuous combined conjugated equine
      estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE/MPA) with those of tibolone on
      symptom control, bleeding pattern, lipid profile and tolerability in
      postmenopausal women. METHODS: This was a randomized, open-label, parallel-group,
      multicenter study. Generally healthy postmenopausal women with an intact uterus
      and no contraindications to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or tibolone were
      enrolled. Each subject was randomly assigned to receive CEE/MPA 0.625 mg-5.0 mg
      or tibolone 2.5 mg daily for 13 treatment cycles, each of 28 days. RESULTS: A
      total of 85 subjects were enrolled and received at least one dose of study
      medication, of which 76 (89.4%) subjects completed the study (n = 40, CEE/MPA; n 
      = 36, tibolone). The incidence of postmenopausal symptoms decreased significantly
      over time in both treatment groups, compared with baseline, including significant
      decreases in the incidence of urogenital and sexual health symptoms. Significant 
      differences in symptom control (other than hot flushes) were observed between
      treatment groups in a few different cycles for different symptoms, but no
      consistent or clinically significant trends were observed. No statistically
      significant differences in the incidence of bleeding were observed between
      treatment groups after cycle 4. Significant decreases in total cholesterol (5.6%)
      and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (7.5%) were observed at cycle 13,
      compared with baseline, in the CEE/MPA group, and significant decreases in
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (8.5%) and triglycerides (13.7%) were 
      observed at cycle 13, compared with baseline, in the tibolone group. Significant 
      weight gain was observed at cycle 13 in the tibolone group (3.05 kg), compared
      with the CEE/MPA group (0.96 kg). The incidences of adverse events were similar
      in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Women treated with CEE/MPA or tibolone
      showed significant improvement of postmenopausal symptoms, including urogenital
      and sexual health symptoms, and had similar bleeding patterns after four cycles
      of therapy. CEE/MPA and tibolone each induced a different mix of changes in the
      lipid profile.

TI  - Treatment of osteoporosis in men using dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.
PG  - 402-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS)
      treatment of osteoporosis in men with T(BMD) > or = 2.5SD. METHODS: Eighty-six
      patients were randomly divided into two groups: treatment group (n = 44) and
      control group (n = 42). DHEAS (100 mg q.d.) was given to the treatment group for 
      6 months. Bone mineral density, (BMD), biochemical markers of bone absorption and
      formation and other serum biochemical markers were measured before and after
      DHEAS treatment. Drug side effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: After oral
      administration of DHEAS (100 mg q.d.) for 6 months, the serum concentrations of
      DHEAS and IGF-I in the treatment group were 93.75% +/- 16.1% and 17.71% +/- 4.2% 
      higher respectively than those in the control group (P < 0.01). The BMD of L2,
      L3, L4, L2 - 4 and Neck sections increased in the treatment group by 2.65% +/-
      0.65%, 2.70% +/- 0.48%, 3.10% +/- 0.41%, 2.82% +/- 0.37% and 2.32% +/- 0.31%,
      respectively, as compared with that the control group (P < 0.05 or 0.01). No
      significant changes were observed in serum FT, E(2) and PSA concentrations in the
      treatment group as compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: The treatment of 
      osteoporosis in men with DHEAS is safe and effective.

TI  - Number of years since menopause: spontaneous bone loss is dependent but response 
      to hormone replacement therapy is independent.
PG  - 637-42
AB  - In this study we examine the influence of number of years since menopause on
      spontaneous bone loss and response to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in 274
      women (56.1 +/- 4.2 years) completing two placebo-controlled HRT studies of 2 or 
      3 year duration. Both cross sectionally and longitudinally, bone loss in
      untreated women was greatest closest to menopause and declined thereafter (r =
      0.34, p < 0.01 for lumbar spine bone loss and r = 0.25, p < 0.05 for femoral neck
      bone loss when correlated with number of years since menopause), such that the
      loss was eliminated in the femoral neck and bone mass increased in the spine in
      women >10 years after menopause. In contrast, bone turnover was consistently
      elevated throughout postmenopause, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The
      association with number of years since menopause was counteracted by both 1 and 2
      mg estradiol combined with gestodene, piperazine, estrone sulfate in combination 
      with norethisterone, and a combination of 2 mg estradiol and 1 mg norethisterone 
      acetate. In addition, the response to various HRT regimens was independent of
      baseline bone mass. Whereas bone loss was significantly related to number of
      years since menopause, all HRT regimens applied arrested bone loss in healthy
      postmenopausal women, regardless of number of years since menopause.

TI  - Changes in bone density and turnover explain the reductions in incidence of
      nonvertebral fractures that occur during treatment with antiresorptive agents.
PG  - 1586-92
AB  - Some, but not all, antiresorptive agents have been shown to reduce the risk of
      nonvertebral fractures. Agents that significantly reduced nonvertebral fracture
      risk also appear to produce larger mean increases in bone mineral density (BMD)
      and reductions in biochemical markers (BCM) of bone turnover, compared with other
      agents. To examine the extent to which increases in BMD and reductions in BCM
      during antiresorptive therapy are associated with reductions in risk of
      nonvertebral fractures, we performed a meta-analysis of all randomized,
      placebo-controlled trials of antiresorptive agents conducted in postmenopausal
      women with osteoporosis (i.e. prior vertebral fracture or low BMD) with available
      relevant data. A total of 18 such trials with usable data were identified,
      including a total of 2,415 women with incident nonvertebral fractures over 69,369
      women-years of follow-up. Poisson regression was used to estimate the association
      between changes in BMD or BCM during the first year and overall reductions in
      risk of nonvertebral fractures (vs. the placebo group) across all trials. Larger 
      increases in BMD and larger reductions in BCM were significantly associated with 
      greater reductions in nonvertebral fracture risk. For example, each 1% increase
      in spine BMD at 1 yr was associated with an 8% reduction in nonvertebral fracture
      risk (P = 0.02). Mean BMD changes at the hip were smaller than at the spine, but 
      the predicted net effect on fracture risk was the same; an agent that increases
      spine BMD by 6% at 1 yr reduces nonvertebral fracture risk by about 39%, and an
      agent that increases hip BMD by 3% at 1 yr reduces nonvertebral fracture risk by 
      about 46%. The results also predict that a 70% reduction in resorption BCM would 
      reduce risk by 40%, and a 50% reduction in formation BCM would reduce risk by
      44%. It appears that either BMD or BCM changes are able to explain the effect of 
      treatment, because a separate variable for treatment was not independently
      significant in any models. These data demonstrate that larger increases in BMD at
      both the spine and hip and larger reductions in both formation and resorption BCM
      are associated with greater reductions in the risk of nonvertebral fractures.
      Antiresorptive agents that do not produce large increases in BMD or large
      reductions in BCM do not appear to and would not be expected to decrease the risk
      of nonvertebral fractures.

TI  - Differential effects of oral estrogen versus oral estrogen-androgen replacement
      therapy on body composition in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 1509-16
AB  - Menopause is associated with decreased lean body mass and increased fat due to
      aging and declining hormone secretion. Estrogens or estrogen-progestins have been
      used to alleviate vasomotor symptoms. However, estrogen-androgen (E/A) therapy is
      also used for vasomotor symptom relief and has been shown to increase lean body
      mass while decreasing fat mass. The objective of this 16-wk, double-blind,
      randomized, parallel group clinical trial was to compare esterified estrogen plus
      methyltestosterone (1.25 mg estrogen + 2.5 mg methyltestosterone/d; E/A group)
      vs. esterified estrogen alone (1.25 mg/d; E group) on body composition. Forty
      postmenopausal women (mean age, 57 yr) participated. Compared with estrogen
      treatment alone, women in the E/A group increased their total lean body mass and 
      reduced their percentage fat for all body parts (P < 0.05). After E/A treatment, 
      there were statistically significant increases in lean body mass by 1.232 kg
      [0.181 +/- 0.004, 0.81 +/- 0.057, and 0.24 +/- 0.009 kg in the upper body (P =
      0.021), trunk (P = 0.001), and lower body (P = 0.047), respectively]. In the E
      group, the increase was 0.31 +/- 0.004, 0.021 +/- 0.03, and 0.056 +/- 0.05 kg in 
      the upper body, trunk, and lower body, respectively. In the E/A group, body fat
      was reduced by 0.90 kg (P = 0.18 for the trunk only), and percentage body fat
      declined by 7.4% (P < or = 0.05 for all body parts). Lower body strength
      increased by 23.1 kg (51 lb) in the E/A group vs. only 11 kg (24.25 lb) in the E 
      group (P = 0.002 between groups). A statistically significant increase in weight 
      (2.7 +/- 5.1 vs. 0.1 +/- 4.6 lb; P < 0.05) was observed in the E/A group compared
      with the E group. When subjects were given self-reporting questionnaires, more
      improvement was noted in sexual functioning and quality of life in the E/A group 
      when compared with patients receiving E alone. There were no noteworthy side
      effects. In conclusion, E/A replacement therapy can improve body composition,
      lower-body muscle strength, quality of life, and sexual functioning in
      postmenopausal women.

TI  - Effect of estrogen replacement plus low-dose alendronate treatment on bone
      density in surgically postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
PG  - 1502-8
AB  - This prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was
      performed to evaluate the effectiveness of estrogens plus low-dose alendronate on
      bone metabolism. A total of 150 surgically postmenopausal women with osteoporosis
      were randomized in three groups: group A, micronized E2 (2 mg/d) plus
      standard-dose alendronate (10 mg/d); group B, micronized E2 plus low-dose
      alendronate (5 mg/d); and group C, micronized E2 plus placebo (one tablet per
      day). In all women, bone mineral density (BMD) and serum bone metabolism markers 
      were assessed at admission and every 6 months for 2 yr. After 2 yr, BMD
      significantly increased compared with baseline in all groups. The percentage BMD 
      change was significantly higher in groups A and B than in group C. The
      differences in BMD detected between groups A and B were not statistically
      significant. Since the 6-month follow-up and throughout the study, serum
      osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase levels and urinary deoxypyridinoline
      and pyrilinks-D excretion were significantly reduced in all groups. Serum bone
      alkaline phosphatase levels significantly decreased in groups A and B, without
      difference between them, in comparison with group C. In conclusion, in surgically
      postmenopausal osteoporotic women treated with estrogen replacement, the addition
      of alendronate at a low dose of 5 mg daily induces a gain of bone mass not
      significantly different in comparison with that obtained using a standard dose of
      10 mg daily.

PG  - 298-301
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are physiological reasons to expect an association between bone
      mineral density of the spine and hip and attachment loss. To this point, however,
      most studies have found no correlation. METHODS: The 135 patients in this report 
      were part of a randomized controlled trial of estrogen replacement. All patients 
      were in good oral health at entry and received annual oral prophylaxis as part of
      the study. Standard probing measurements were made with a pressure sensitive
      probe at 6 sites on each tooth. Bone mineral density was measured with
      dual-energy x-ray absorbtiometry at the lumbar spine (anterior-posterior and
      lateral) and proximal femur (neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, Ward's triangle, 
      and total area). These procedures were performed at baseline and at annual
      intervals for 3 years. RESULTS: Correlations between cross-sectional measurements
      of clinical attachment level and bone mineral density were very weak, and did not
      approach statistical significance (-0.06 < or =r < or =0.10, 0.15 < or =P < or
      =0.75). A few somewhat stronger correlations were found between longitudinal
      changes in bone mineral density and attachment (-0.20 < or = r < or =-0.02, 0.02 
      < or = P < or =0.81). Although the correlations in the longitudinal changes were 
      weak, they were consistently in the direction of greater bone mineral density
      being associated with less attachment loss. CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear
      association between clinical attachment level and bone mineral density of the
      lumbar spine and proximal femur, whether examined on a cross-sectional or
      longitudinal basis. Patterns in the data suggest there may be a weak association 
      in the longitudinal changes.

TI  - The impact of different doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate on mood symptoms in 
      sequential hormonal therapy.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare adverse mood effects of two different doses 
      of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) during postmenopausal hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) in women with and without a history of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
      The study was designed as a randomized double-blind cross-over study and included
      36 postmenopausal women at three health care areas in northern Sweden. The women 
      received 2 mg estradiol continuously during five 28-day cycles and 10 mg or 20 mg
      MPA sequentially for 12 days during each cycle. The main outcome measures were
      mood and physical symptoms noted on a daily rating scale. We found that physical 
      symptoms did not differ between 10 and 20 mg MPA. Both women with a history of
      PMS and women without responded with more negative mood symptoms with the lower
      dose of MPA. In women with previous PMS the higher dose of MPA enhanced positive 
      mood symptoms. With respect to mood and physical symptoms, the aim to lower MPA
      doses in HRT is unwarranted.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy and endometrial safety of two estradiol
      valerate/dienogest combinations and Kliogest for continuous combined hormone
      replacement therapy in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 109-18
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and endometrial safety of two estradiol
      valerate/dienogest combinations with Kliogest in the treatment of postmenopausal 
      symptoms. DESIGN: This was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study.
      METHODS: Patients were randomized to estradiol valerate 2.0 mg/dienogest 2.0 mg
      (Climodien), estradiol valerate 2.0 mg/dienogest 3.0 mg (E2Val 2/DNG 3); or
      estradiol 2.0 mg/estriol 1.0 mg/norethisterone acetate 1.0 mg (Kliogest) once
      daily for 1 year. The primary efficacy variable was the Kupperman index.
      Endometrial safety was determined primarily by biopsy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:
      Climodien and E2Val 2/DNG 3 were therapeutically equivalent to Kliogest (mean
      changes in Kupperman index -20.1, -19.0 and -18.3, respectively). No
      statistically significant differences existed between treatment groups in the
      severity of postmenopausal symptoms. The incidences of endometrial atrophy were
      similar in all groups. Climodien appeared to be superior to Kliogest in terms of 
      vaginal bleeding pattern, whereas E2Val 2/DNG 3 was associated with a slightly
      higher incidence and greater intensity of vaginal bleeding. The incidences of
      adverse events were similar in all groups. A greater proportion of women in the
      Kliogest and E2Val 2/DNG 3 groups experienced vaginal bleeding, whereas breast
      problems were more common with Climodien. Climodien and E2Val 2/DNG 3 induced
      desirable changes in insulin-like growth factor I (decrease) and sex hormone
      binding globulin (increase) that were not seen with Kliogest.

      symptoms and bleeding.
PG  - 262-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the acceptability, efficacy and endometrial safety of
      transdermal estradiol gel (Divigel/Sandrena) combined with monthly or quarterly
      oral progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate). METHODS: This 12-month,
      multicenter, open-label study was carried out at 12 study centers in Finland and 
      Sweden. A total of 395 postmenopausal women received 1 mg estradiol in 1 g gel,
      daily, with oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg for the first 12 days every
      month (groups I and III) or every 3 months (group II). The main outcome measures 
      were relief of climacteric symptoms, bleeding patterns and endometrial safety.
      RESULTS: All regimens reduced the severity of hot flushes, sweating episodes and 
      vaginal dryness. In groups I and III, approximately 80% and 70% of women,
      respectively, had regular monthly withdrawal bleeding (excepting the first
      cycle), with irregular bleeding in 8.3% and 5.3% of treatment months. In group
      II, approximately 94% of women had regular tri-monthly withdrawal bleeding, with 
      irregular bleeding in 10.7% of the treatment months. Endometrial hyperplasia was 
      observed in 0.3% of women. More than 87% of subjects completed the study, and 97%
      of these rated the gel as acceptable or convenient. CONCLUSIONS: Both the 1- and 
      3-month regimens were equally effective in controlling climacteric symptoms and
      protecting against endometrial hyperstimulation. The bleeding patterns were
      comparable between groups and were similar to those reported for oral estrogens. 
      Estradiol gel was highly acceptable to the majority of women.

TI  - A randomized trial of sodium fluoride (60 mg) +/- estrogen in postmenopausal
      osteoporotic vertebral fractures: increased vertebral fractures and peripheral
      bone loss with sodium fluoride; concurrent estrogen prevents peripheral loss, but
      not vertebral fractures.
PG  - 158-70
AB  - Postmenopausal Caucasian women aged less than 80 years (n = 99) with one or more 
      atraumatic vertebral fracture and no hip fractures, were treated by cyclical
      administration of enteric coated sodium fluoride (NaF) or no NaF for 27 months,
      with precautions to prevent excessive stimulation of bone turnover. In the first 
      study 65 women, unexposed to estrogen (-E study), age 70.8 +/- 0.8 years (mean
      +/- SEM) were all treated with calcium (Ca) 1.0-1.2 g daily and ergocalciferol
      (D) 0.25 mg per 25 kg once weekly and were randomly assigned to cyclical NaF (6
      months on, 3 months off, initial dose 60 mg/day; group F CaD, n = 34) or no NaF
      (group CaD, n = 31). In the second study 34 patients, age 65.5 +/- 1.2 years, on 
      hormone replacement therapy (E) at baseline, had this standardized, and were all 
      treated with Ca and D and similarly randomized (FE CaD, n = 17; E CaD, n = 17)
      (+E study). The patients were stratified according to E status and subsequently
      assigned randomly to +/- NaF. Seventy-five patients completed the trial. Both
      groups treated with NaF showed an increase in lumbar spinal density (by DXA)
      above baseline by 27 months: FE CaD + 16.2% and F CaD +9.3% (both p = 0.0001). In
      neither group CaD nor E CaD did lumbar spinal density increase. Peripheral bone
      loss occurred at most sites in the F CaD group at 27 months: tibia/fibula shaft
      -7.3% (p = 0.005); femoral shaft -7.1% (p = 0.004); distal forearm -4.0%
      (p=0.004); total hip -4.1% (p = 0.003); and femoral neck -3.5% (p = 0.006). No
      significant loss occurred in group FE CaD. Differences between the two NaF groups
      were greatest at the total hip at 27 months but were not significant [p < 0.05;
      in view of the multiple bone mineral density (BMD) sites, an alpha of 0.01 was
      employed to denote significance in BMD changes throughout this paper]. Using
      Cox's proportional hazards model, in the -E study there were significantly more
      patients with first fresh vertebral fractures in those treated with NaF than in
      those not so treated (RR = 24.2, p = 0.008, 95% CI 2.3-255). Patients developing 
      first fresh fractures in the first 9 months were markedly different between
      groups: -23% of F CaD, 0 of CaD, 29% of FE CaD and 0 of E CaD. The incidence of
      incomplete (stress) fractures was similar in the two NaF-treated groups. Complete
      nonvertebral fractures did not occur in the two +E groups; there were no
      differences between groups F CaD and CaD. Baseline BMD (spine and femoral neck)
      was related to incident vertebral fractures in the control groups (no NaF), but
      not in the two NaF groups. Our results and a literature review indicate that
      fluoride salts, if used, should be at low dosage, with pretreatment and
      co-treatment with a bone resorption inhibitor.

TI  - Effect of soy phytoestrogens on hot flashes in postmenopausal women with breast
      cancer: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 1449-55
AB  - PURPOSE: Vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats, in breast
      cancer survivors are often worsened by chemotherapy and tamoxifen, and/or the
      discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy at diagnosis. This study evaluated
      the acceptability and effectiveness of a soy beverage containing phytoestrogens
      as a treatment for hot flashes in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.
      METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was
      conducted in postmenopausal women with moderate hot flashes who were previously
      treated for early-stage breast cancer. Women were stratified for tamoxifen use
      and randomized to a soy beverage (n = 59) containing 90 mg of isoflavones or to a
      placebo rice beverage (n = 64). Women recorded the number and severity of hot
      flashes daily with a daily menopause diary for 4 weeks at baseline and for 12
      weeks while consuming 500 mL of a soy or placebo beverage. RESULTS: There were no
      significant differences between the soy and placebo groups in the number of hot
      flashes or hot flash scores. However, presumably because of a strong placebo
      effect, both groups had significant reductions in hot flashes. Mild
      gastrointestinal side effects were experienced by both groups but occurred with
      greater frequency and severity with soy. The mean serum genistein concentration
      at 6 weeks was significantly higher in women who consumed soy (0.61 +/- 0.43
      micromol/L) compared with placebo (0.43 +/- 0.37 micromol/L) (P =.02). Overall
      acceptability and compliance were high and similar in both groups. CONCLUSION:
      The soy beverage did not alleviate hot flashes in women with breast cancer any
      more than did a placebo. Future research into other compounds is recommended to
      identify safe and effective therapies for hot flashes in breast cancer survivors.

TI  - Oestrogen attenuates coronary vasoconstriction after angioplasty: role of
      endothelin-1.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There were controversies as to whether endothelin-1 is
      released after coronary angioplasty. We sought to determine whether endothelin-1 
      is released after coronary angioplasty and whether oestrogen administration can
      affect coronary vasomotor tone by reducing endothelin-1 concentrations. METHODS: 
      The study was designed to prospectively investigate 24 consecutive patients
      scheduled for elective coronary angioplasty. Patients were randomized into two
      groups according to whether they did not (group 1, n = 12) or did (group 2, n =
      12) have intracoronary treatment with oestrogen. Quantitative coronary
      angiography was monitored at baseline, immediately after successful angioplasty, 
      and 15 min after the last deflation. Blood samples for measuring the levels of
      endothelin-1 were drawn from the ascending aorta and the coronary sinus
      simultaneously before angioplasty and 15 min after balloon dilatation. RESULTS:
      The diameters of the coronary artery at the dilated segments were significantly
      reduced 15 min after dilation compared with those immediately after dilation in
      group 1 from 3.20 +/- 0.22 to 2.30 +/- 0.23 mm (P < 0.001), respectively. The
      vasoconstriction was significantly blunted in group 2. The endothelin-1 levels
      from the coronary sinus rose significantly, by 29%, 15 min after angioplasty in
      group 1, which was attenuated after administering oestrogen. Significant
      correlation was found between the changes of coronary vasomotion of the dilated
      segment and endothelin-1 levels (r = 0.70, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Endothelin-1 is
      released into the coronary circulation after angioplasty, and this vasoactive
      substance may contribute to the occurrence of vasoconstriction. The
      vasoconstriction is attenuated by oestrogen by reducing the endothelin-1 levels. 
      This finding provided a new strategy to treat coronary vasoconstriction after
      angioplasty.

TI  - The efficacy of two dosages of a continuous combined hormone replacement regimen.
PG  - 123-31
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of a low-dose combination of estradiol (E2) 
      and norethisterone acetate (NETA) on bone markers, lipid and bleeding profiles
      and menopausal symptoms. METHOD: Ninety-six healthy Chinese postmenopausal women 
      were allocated randomly to receive 1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA (low-dose hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT)) or 2 mg E2/1 mg NETA (high-dose HRT) for 6 months.
      RESULTS: Bone resorption markers (collagen I N-terminal telopeptides (NTX) and
      deoxypyridinoline (dPyr)) were significantly reduced; -66 and -32%, respectively,
      in high-dose HRT versus -55 and -24%, respectively, in low-dose HRT.
      Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase remained unchanged with either combination of 
      hormones. Total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
      levels were decreased significantly (-12 and -13%, respectively, in high-dose HRT
      vs. -7 and -8% in low-dose HRT). High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was
      decreased to a lesser extent in low-dose HRT and triglycerides (TG) levels
      remained unchanged. Both the low and high-dose HRT were effective in alleviating 
      menopausal symptoms. After 6 months of treatment, 2% of women in the low-dose HRT
      were bleeding compared with 23% in the high-dose HRT. Breast pain occurred in 2% 
      of women in low-dose HRT compared with 15% in high-dose HRT. The endometrium in
      the majority of the women remained normal. CONCLUSION: Menopausal symptoms were
      reduced effectively in postmenopausal women on either low-dose or high-dose HRT. 
      TC, LDL-C levels and bone resorption markers were reduced in a dose-dependent
      manner. Low-dose HRT provided a better bleeding profile and the incidence of
      breast pain was low.

TI  - Effect of intravenous testosterone on myocardial ischemia in men with coronary
      artery disease.
PG  - 249-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the effect of estrogen on atherosclerotic coronary artery 
      disease (CAD) risk in women have produced conflicting results. Similar confusion,
      but fewer data, exists on the effect of testosterone on CAD risk in men. METHODS:
      We used 99mTc sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
      myocardial perfusion imaging to examine the acute effect of intravenous
      testosterone in 32 men (mean age, 69.1 +/- 6.4 years) with provocable myocardial 
      ischemia on standard medical therapy. Patients performed 3 exercise (n = 18) or
      adenosine (n = 16) stress tests during the infusion of placebo or 2 doses of
      testosterone designed to increase testosterone 2 or 6 times baseline. RESULTS:
      Serum testosterone increased 137 +/- 58% and 488 +/- 113%, and estradiol levels
      increased 27 +/- 46% and 76 +/- 57%, (P <.001 for all) during the 2 testosterone 
      infusions. There were no differences among the placebo or testosterone groups in 
      peak heart rate, systolic blood pressure, maximal rate pressure product,
      perfusion imaging scores, or the onset of ST-segment depression. CONCLUSIONS:
      Acute testosterone infusion has neither a beneficial nor a deleterious effect on 
      the onset and magnitude of stress-induced myocardial ischemia in men with stable 
      CAD.

TI  - [Clinical effects of hormone replacement therapy with estradiol valerate and
      cyproterone acetate in perimenopausal women].
PG  - 67-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: In perimenopause many women complain of psychogenic and organic
      disorders often connected with initial and increasing levels of hypoestrogenism. 
      In this study we evaluated the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in
      symptomatic women in perimenopause. METHODS: We enrolled 100 healthy and
      symptomatic women who were randomly distributed to two groups for a 12-month
      study. Group A: 50 patients received HRT with estradiol valerate and cyproterone 
      acetate (Pausene(R)); Group B: 50 patients were used as a control group (treated 
      with Cacit Vitamin D30(R)). A number of clinical and instrumental tests were
      performed at 0, 6 and 12 months to evaluate any changes in vasomotor and
      urogenital symptoms, bone and serum homeostasis and possible sexual disorders.
      The statistical analysis was performed using the c2 test. RESULTS: The group of
      women receiving HRT showed a significant reduction in vasomotor clinical symptoms
      (p<0.001) and sexual disorders (p<0.002); this was not reflected in the control
      group where libido decreased steadily with apparent slight improvements only at
      the end of the study. The urogenital disorders disappeared almost completely in
      Group A, whereas they diminished in Group B. HRT patients also showed a slight
      increase (p<0.001) in the initial value of BMD (bone mineral density), a
      reduction in the marker for bone turnover and an improved lipid profile (p<0.05).
      These changes were unfortunately not noted in Group B. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis 
      of these results we conclude that HRT appeared to have a beneficial effect on
      perimenopausal clinical symptoms over the 12-month period, leading to marked
      improvements in the psychophysical wellbeing of symptomatic women in
      perimenopause.

TI  - Lack of effects of acute estradiol on mood in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 71-7
AB  - Chronic treatment with estrogen is believed to improve mood in postmenopausal
      women, and recent preclinical evidence suggests that estradiol may also affect
      mood and behavior through acute neuronal membrane-mediated effects on the central
      nervous system. This study was designed to characterize potential mood effects of
      single doses of transdermal estradiol in healthy postmenopausal women who were
      not taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Twelve women participated in a
      five-session, within-subjects, double-blind study, in which they received
      placebo, transdermal estradiol (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg), or D-amphetamine (15 mg,
      oral) in a randomized order. Amphetamine was included as a positive control.
      Dependent measures included self-report measures of mood, physiological measures,
      and plasma hormone levels. Despite dose-dependent increases in plasma estradiol
      levels, and despite the fact that D-amphetamine produced its prototypic
      stimulant-like effects in these postmenopausal women, estradiol did not produce
      effects on mood. The finding that acute administration of exogenous estradiol did
      not alter mood suggests that more chronic exposure to estradiol is needed to
      produce mood-enhancing effects.

TI  - Serum estradiol level and risk of breast cancer during treatment with raloxifene.
PG  - 216-20
AB  - CONTEXT: As endogenous estradiol increases, risk of breast cancer increases.
      Raloxifene competes with endogenous estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in
      breast tissue. A woman's estradiol level may alter the effects of raloxifene on
      breast cancer and other outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that
      raloxifene reduces breast cancer risk more in women with relatively high
      estradiol levels than in women with very low estradiol levels. DESIGN: Analysis
      of the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1994 to 1999. SETTING: One hundred eighty
      community settings and medical practices in 25 countries including the United
      States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7290 postmenopausal women aged 80 years or
      younger with osteoporosis who had baseline serum estradiol concentrations
      measured by a central laboratory using a sensitive assay. Women with a history of
      breast cancer or estrogen use were excluded. INTERVENTION: Participants were
      randomly assigned to receive 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d of raloxifene (n = 4843) or
      matching placebo (n = 2447) for 4 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: New cases of
      histopathologically confirmed breast cancer in the treatment and placebo groups, 
      stratified by estradiol levels. RESULTS: In the placebo group, women with
      estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L (2.7 pg/mL) had a 6.8-fold higher rate of
      breast cancer (3.0% per 4 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8%-4.1%) than
      that of women with undetectable estradiol levels (0.6% per 4 years; 95% CI,
      0%-1.1%; P =.005 for trend). Women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L
      in the raloxifene group had a rate of breast cancer that was 76% (95% CI,
      53%-88%) lower than that of women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L in
      the placebo group (absolute rate reduction, 2.2% [95% CI, 1.0%-3.5%; number
      needed to treat = 45]). In contrast, women with undetectable estradiol levels had
      similar breast cancer risk whether or not they were treated with raloxifene (risk
      difference, -0.1%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 0.6%; P =.02 for the interaction). In this
      cohort, treating women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L with
      raloxifene for 4 years would have avoided 47% of breast cancer cases.
      CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of estradiol level by sensitive assay in postmenopausal 
      women identifies those at high risk of breast cancer who may benefit most from
      raloxifene. If confirmed, this suggests that measuring estradiol and treating
      women with high estradiol levels could substantially reduce the rate of breast
      cancer among postmenopausal women.

TI  - Trimegestone: expanding therapeutic choices for the treatment of the menopause.
PG  - 1737-44
AB  - Trimegestone is a novel norpregnane progestin, which has a potent progesterone
      receptor and very low androgen receptor affinities but no detectable affinity to 
      oestrogen receptor. Trimegestone has been developed for use in conjunction with
      oestrogen for postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The dose of
      trimegestone required for endometrial safety was optimised in a dose ranging
      study. Oral trimegestone was administered at 0.05, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/day, days
      15 - 28 along with continuous oral micronised oestradiol at 2 mg daily. The
      majority of women in the four dose groups experienced relief of climacteric
      symptoms by the end of the third treatment cycle. The incidence of pre-menstrual 
      tension-like symptoms was low and did not differ between the four dose groups.
      After 6 months of treatment, the bleeding pattern showed a clear dose-dependent
      modulation such that the higher the dose of trimegestone administered the more
      predictable was the day of onset of bleeding and the shorter and lighter the
      bleeding episodes became. This was further confirmed in another study comparing
      trimegestone in 0.5 and 0.25 mg doses to norethisterone acetate, where women on
      the 0.5 mg dose experienced more favourable bleeding pattern compared with the
      lower dose of 0.25 mg or to norethisterone acetate. In the dose ranging study,
      96% of endometrial specimens obtained at the end of the study had secretory
      changes. The lipoprotein profile measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months during the 
      dose ranging study confirmed the fact that trimegestone, irrespective of the
      dose, did not negate the beneficial effects of oestrogen on lipids. CONCLUSION:
      trimegestone is an effective and well-tolerated new progestin, which does not
      negate the beneficial effects of oestrogen on lipids.

TI  - Quality of life and sexuality changes in postmenopausal women receiving tibolone 
      therapy.
PG  - 314-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT) and tibolone on the sexuality and quality of life of
      Taiwanese postmenopausal women. METHODS: Forty-eight postmenopausal women were
      enrolled and prospectively randomized to receive either HRT or tibolone for 3
      months. At the end of the 3-month period, quality of life measures were assessed 
      using the Greene Climacteric Scale and attitudes of sexuality were evaluated
      using the McCoy Sex Scale. RESULTS: Based on subjective qualitative scores,
      tibolone treatment was at least as effective as continuous combined HRT in
      improving quality of life. It also effectively prevented withdrawal bleeding,
      which may occur during HRT use. Compared with continuous combined HRT, tibolone
      treatment was also associated with perceived improvement of sexual performance,
      including general sexual satisfaction, sexual interest, sexual fantasies, sexual 
      arousal and orgasm, with decreased frequencies of vaginal dryness and painful
      intercourse. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that both tibolone 
      and continuous combined HRT have positive effects on the quality of life of
      Taiwanese postmenopausal women. Sexuality is affected more by tibolone than by
      HRT.

TI  - Open, multicenter comparison of efficacy, cycle control, and tolerability of a
      23-day oral contraceptive regimen with 20 microg ethinyl estradiol and 75 microg 
      gestodene and a 21-day regimen with 20 microg ethinyl estradiol and 150 microg
      desogestrel.
PG  - 201-7
AB  - This prospective, open, randomized study was conducted to compare the
      contraceptive reliability, cycle control, and tolerability of a 23-day regimen
      with 20 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 75 microg gestodene (GSD) and a 21-day 
      regimen with 20 microg EE and 150 microg desogestrel (DSG). Participants took
      either 23 tablets with active substances plus 5 placebo tablets (23-day EE/GSD)
      or 21 tablets with active substances followed by 7 days without pill-taking
      (21-day EE/DSG). Contraceptive efficacy, cycle control, and tolerability were
      evaluated over a period of seven cycles. Efficacy data gathered from 5967
      treatment cycles (23-day EE/GSD: 2975 cycles; 21-day EE/DSG: 2992 cycles) were
      obtained from 890 participants (445 in each group). Both preparations proved to
      be effective contraceptives and provided good cycle control. No pregnancy during 
      treatment was recorded. This resulted in a study Pearl Index of 0.0 for both
      treatments. For 23-day EE/GSD, 32.4% of participants reported at least one
      intracyclic bleeding episode during Cycles 2-4 (primary target) compared to 31.5%
      for 21-day EE/DSG. In the 23-day EE/GSD group, intracyclic bleeding episodes were
      reported by 48.8% of the participants in Cycle 1 but in only 15.1% in Cycle 7,
      and in the 21-day regimen group by 43.4% in Cycle 1 and only 14.2% in Cycle 7.
      Overall, intracyclic bleeding was reported in 20.9% of cycles for both
      treatments.A greater number of 23-day EE/GSD participants had shorter withdrawal 
      bleeding periods than with 21-day EE/DSG. In significantly (p <0.0001) more
      cycles in the 23-day EE/GSD group participants reported withdrawal bleeding
      periods that lasted only 1-4 days compared to the 21-day EE/DSG group. For the
      majority of the treatment cycles, the median number of bleeding days in the
      23-day EE/GSD group was 4 days and in the 21-day EE/DSG group 5 days. Both
      preparations were well tolerated and showed a similar adverse events pattern. The
      discontinuation rate because of adverse events was low (23-day EE/GSD: 6.1%;
      21-day EE/DSG: 5.6%). No serious vascular adverse events were reported. More than
      82% in the 23-day EE/GSD group and 79% in the 21-day EE/DSG group either lost
      more than 2 kg of weight or did not gain weight during the study. The treatment
      effect on blood pressure was negligible. There were no appreciable changes in
      mean laboratory values over the course of the study compared to baseline.

TI  - Chlormadinone acetate versus micronized progesterone in the sequential combined
      hormone replacement therapy of the menopause.
PG  - 85-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of chlormadinone acetate (CA) versus
      micronized progesterone (P) were assessed in non-hysterectomized postmenopausal
      women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, parallel group 
      study with a 6-month double-blind period followed by a 12-month open period.
      Patients were randomized to receive every month during 18 months percutaneous 17 
      beta-estradiol (E(2)) 1.5 mg/day from Day 1 to 24 of treatment cycle, combined
      from Day 11 to 24 to either CA 10 mg/day (n=167) or P 200 mg/day (n=169).
      Endometrial biopsy (EB, main analysis criterion) was performed at baseline, and
      at Day 18-24 of the 6th and 18th cycles. RESULTS: At Month 6, EB did not evidence
      any hyperplasia. EB were inadequate for assessment in 24.5% and 47.5% of patients
      in the CA and MP groups, respectively. CA was found to be as protective as P
      (96.3% and 92.0% of success). However, the hormonal status of the endometrium
      differed (P<0.001): a secretory endometrium was found in 81.5% of the CA
      patients, compared to 50.7% in the P group. These transformations resulted in
      predictable, cyclic bleeding in 94.5% of the CA patients, compared to only 62.3% 
      of the P patients (P=0.0001). Unscheduled bleeding, spotting and/or metrorrhagia,
      were more frequent under P than under CA (17.9% and 13.7%, respectively). The
      beneficial effects on hot flushes were more important in the CA group than in the
      P (P<0.001). At Month 18, the biopsy and clinical results were similar to those
      obtained at Month 6. The safety profile, particularly the lipid one, was similar 
      in both groups, except for drowsiness and dizziness, which were significantly
      more frequent under P than under CA. CONCLUSION: The progestative effects of CA
      on the endometrium and on menopause-related symptoms were at least as good as
      those of P. Moreover, CA resulted more often than P in secretory effects, and in 
      satisfying bleeding patterns.

TI  - Influence of smoking on the antiosteoporotic efficacy of raloxifene.
PG  - 4178-82
AB  - The efficacy of estrogen therapy may be modified in women who smoke because of
      increased catabolism of estrogen and the interaction of tobacco products with the
      estradiol receptor. We examined whether the efficacy of raloxifene differed in
      smoking vs. nonsmoking women. We compared change in bone mineral density and
      biochemical markers of bone turnover, and incidence of new vertebral fracture in 
      postmenopausal women of the Multiple Outcomes on Raloxifene Efficacy trial, who
      were randomized to either raloxifene (60 or 120 mg/d) or placebo. In the 17% of
      women who were current smokers, we found, compared with nonsmokers, lowered
      baseline trochanter bone mineral density (0.540 vs. 0.557 g/cm(2); P < 0.001) and
      serum osteocalcin (24.8 vs. 26.6 ng/liter; P < 0.001). Baseline urinary type I
      collagen breakdown products was increased among smokers (291.8 vs. 276.9
      micromol/liter; P = 0.04). Body mass index was also lower in smokers (24.3 vs.
      25.4; P < 0.001). After 6 months of treatment, there was no significant
      difference in reduction of bone turnover between smokers and nonsmokers. After 4 
      yr of treatment, the smoking-treatment interaction was not significant between
      smokers and nonsmokers for the percent increase in femoral neck bone mineral
      density (P = 0.25), trochanter bone mineral density (P = 0.24), and spine bone
      mineral density (P = 0.37). The smoking-treatment interaction for reduction in
      vertebral fracture risk was not significant either [odds ratio for fracture, 0.67
      (0.45-0.98) for smokers and 0.56 (0.47-0.68) for nonsmokers; P = 0.44]. These
      results were not modified after stratification by tertiles of body mass index or 
      when comparing heavy smokers vs. light smokers. We conclude that smoking does not
      influence the antiosteoporotic effect of raloxifene. This may represent an
      advantage over estrogen replacement therapy.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of transdermal
      dihydrotestosterone gel on muscular strength, mobility, and quality of life in
      older men with partial androgen deficiency.
PG  - 4078-88
AB  - The efficacy and safety of androgen supplementation in older men remains
      controversial. Despite biochemical evidence of partial androgen deficiency in
      older men, controlled studies using T demonstrate equivocal benefits.
      Furthermore, the importance of aromatization and 5alpha reduction in androgen
      actions among older men remains unclear. Dihydrotestosterone is the highest
      potency natural androgen with the additional features that it is neither
      aromatizable nor susceptible to potency amplification by 5alpha reduction.
      Therefore, the effects of dihydrotestosterone may differ from those of T in older
      men. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3 months treatment with
      transdermal dihydrotestosterone gel on muscle strength, mobility, and quality of 
      life in ambulant, community-dwelling men aged 60 yr or older. Eligible men
      (plasma T < or =15 nmol/liter) were randomized to undergo daily dermal
      application of 70 mg dihydrotestosterone gel (n = 18) or vehicle (n = 19) and
      were studied before, monthly during, and 1 month after treatment. Among 33 (17
      dihydrotestosterone, 16 placebo) men completing the study with a high degree of
      compliance, dihydrotestosterone had significant effects on circulating hormones
      (increased dihydrotestosterone; decreased total and free testosterone, LH, and
      FSH; unchanged SHBG and estradiol), lipid profiles (decreased total and
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterols; unchanged high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol and triglycerides), hematopoiesis (increased hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
      and red cell counts), and body composition (decreased skinfold thickness and fat 
      mass; unchanged lean mass and waist to hip ratio). Muscle strength measured by
      isokinetic peak torque was increased in flexion of the dominant knee but not in
      knee extension or shoulder contraction, nor was there any significant change in
      gait, balance, or mobility tests, in cognitive function, or in quality of life
      scales. Dihydrotestosterone treatment had no adverse effects on prostate
      (unchanged prostate volumes and prostate-specific antigen) and cardiovascular (no
      adverse change in vascular reactivity or lipids) safety markers. We conclude that
      3 months treatment with transdermal dihydrotestosterone gel demonstrates expected
      androgenic effects, short-term safety, and limited improvement in lower limb
      muscle strength but no change in physical functioning or cognitive function.

TI  - Influence of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy on platelet serotonin
      uptake site and serotonin 2A receptor binding.
PG  - 450-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether binding of [3H]paroxetine to the platelet serotonin
      transporter or binding of [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to the platelet
      5-HT(2A) receptor are influenced by postmenopausal estrogen/progestogen
      treatment. METHODS: Twenty-three postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms
      completed this double-blind, randomized, crossover study. The women received 2 mg
      of estradiol continuously during four 28-day cycles. In the last 14 days of each 
      cycle, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate, 1 mg of norethindrone acetate, or
      placebo was given. Before treatment, as well as once during the last week of each
      treatment, blood samples were collected for analysis of [3H]LSD and
      [3H]paroxetine binding. The power of the study setup was 81%. The study had an
      effect size of 0.36, corresponding to the ability to detect a 15% difference in
      [3H]paroxetine and [3H]LSD binding between treatments with alpha =.05 and beta
      =.20, based on a previously reported standard deviation within cells of 20% of
      the mean binding values. RESULTS: The number of platelet receptors (B(max)), or
      the affinity of the radioligand to the receptor (K(d)), for [3H]paroxetine
      binding did not change during estrogen or estrogen-progestogen treatment, nor did
      B(max) or K(d) for [3H]LSD binding change during the different treatments.
      However, in a subgroup of depressed patients, the decrease in B(max) for [3H]LSD 
      binding during treatment was significantly more pronounced than in the
      nondepressed subgroup (P <.05). CONCLUSION: Estrogen treatment with or without
      the addition of progestogen does not affect binding to the serotonin transporter 
      or to the serotonergic 5-HT(2A) receptor in healthy postmenopausal women.

TI  - Unscheduled bleeding during initiation of continuous combined hormone replacement
      therapy: a direct comparison of two combinations of norethindrone acetate and
      ethinyl estradiol to medroxyprogesterone acetate and conjugated equine estrogens.
PG  - 321-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there are differences between continuous combined
      hormone replacement therapies on bleeding control. DESIGN: Nine hundred and
      forty-five postmenopausal women were randomized to one of seven double-blind
      treatment groups (placebo, 0.25 mg norethindrone acetate (NA)/5 microg ethinyl
      estradiol (EE), 1 mg NA/5 microg EE, 0.5 mg NA/10 microg EE, 1 mg NA/10 microg
      EE, 5 microg EE, and 10 micro EE) or unmasked 0.625 mg conjugated equine
      estrogens (CEE)/2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Treatment was for 12
      months; subjects kept daily diaries recording whether they had bleeding and/or
      spotting. RESULTS: The results focused on currently commercially available
      hormone replacement therapy products (femhrt [1 mg NA/5 microg EE] and Prempro
      [0.625 mg CEE/2.5 mg MPA]) as well as a high-dose NA/EE dose combination (1/10)
      over the first 6 months of use, the most critical period in establishing
      treatment adherence. At the end of month 6 there was a greater incidence of
      amenorrhea with both NA/EE dose combinations compared with CEE/MPA (p = 0.009 for
      1 mg NA/5 microg EE and p = 0.006 for 1 mg NA/10 microg EE). Statistically
      significantly more women were amenorrheic at every month based on cumulative
      amenorrhea for 1 mg NA/5 microg (p < 0.05) compared with CEE/MPA; at months 3 and
      6 more women were amenorrheic on 1 mg NA/10 microg EE compared with CEE/MPA using
      the cumulative amenorrhea parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that
      statistically significantly more women attained amenorrhea based on various
      parameters when administered continuous combined NA/EE compared with CEE/MPA. The
      potential for long-term treatment compliance based on better bleeding control may
      optimize the opportunity to prevent osteoporosis as well as other associated
      health benefits.

TI  - High-dose estradiol improves cognition for women with AD: results of a randomized
      study.
PG  - 605-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the cognitive and neuroendocrine response to treatment
      with a high dose of estrogen for postmenopausal women with AD. METHODS: Twenty
      postmenopausal women with AD were randomized to receive either 0.10 mg/day of 17 
      beta-estradiol by skin patch or a placebo patch for 8 weeks. Subjects were
      evaluated at baseline, at weeks 3, 5, and 8 during treatment, and again 8 weeks
      after treatment termination. During each visit, cognition was assessed with a
      battery of neuropsychological tests, and blood samples were collected to measure 
      plasma estradiol as well as several other neuroendocrine markers of interest.
      RESULTS: Significant effects of estrogen treatment were observed on attention
      (Stroop Color Word Interference Test), verbal memory (Buschke Selective Reminding
      Test), and visual memory (Figure Copy/Memory). In addition, women treated with
      estrogen demonstrated improved performance on a test of semantic memory (Boston
      Naming Test) compared with subjects who received a placebo. Estrogen appeared to 
      have a suppressive effect on the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system such
      that plasma concentration of IGF binding protein-3 was significantly reduced and 
      plasma levels of estradiol and IGF-I were negatively correlated during estrogen
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of a higher dose of estrogen may enhance
      attention and memory for postmenopausal women with AD. Although these findings
      provide further clinical evidence to support a cognitive benefit of estrogen for 
      women with AD, studies evaluating the effect of estradiol administration, in
      particular, using larger sample sizes and for longer treatment durations are
      warranted before the therapeutic potential of estrogen replacement for women with
      AD can be firmly established.

TI  - Anti-ischemic action of estrogen-progestogen continuous combined hormone
      replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with established angina pectoris: a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial.
PG  - 372-83
AB  - The benefit of treating postmenopausal women with established cardiovascular
      disease with combined estrogen-progestogen hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is
      controversial. This study investigated the effect of treatment with estradiol and
      norethisterone acetate on exercise tolerance and on the frequency and severity of
      ischemic attacks in postmenopausal women with stable angina pectoris. A total of 
      74 Chinese women were recruited for this 16-week double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial. They were randomly allocated into two groups; one group received
      placebo/placebo/placebo and the other group received
      placebo/estrogen-progestogen/placebo. Estrogen-progestogen continuous combined
      HRT increased both time to 1-mm ST depression (99.1 s, p < 0.05) compared with a 
      mean decrease of 22.9 s with placebo (p < 0.05), and total exercise duration also
      showed a significant increase (32.7 s, p < 0.05) after treatment compared with
      placebo (2.5 s, p < 0.05). In addition, the total number of ischemic events/24 h 
      during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring decreased by 0.82 events after 
      treatment (p < 0.05) compared with an increase in the placebo group (0.94), a
      highly significant difference (p = 0.006). These results suggest that the
      administration of this particular combined hormone replacement preparation may
      have a beneficial effect on myocardial ischemia in postmenopausal women with
      established coronary disease.

TI  - Effects of hormone replacement therapy and high-impact physical exercise on
      skeletal muscle in post-menopausal women: a randomized placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 147-57
AB  - An age-related decline in muscle performance is a known risk factor for falling, 
      fracture and disability. In women, a clear deterioration is observed from early
      menopause. The effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in preserving muscle
      performance is, however, unclear. This trial examined the effects of a 12-month
      HRT and high-impact physical exercise regimen on skeletal muscle in women in
      early menopause. A total of 80 women aged 50-57 years were assigned randomly to
      one of four groups: exercise (Ex), HRT, exercise+HRT (ExHRT) and control (Co).
      The exercise groups participated in a high-impact training programme. The
      administration of HRT (oestradiol/noretisterone acetate) or placebo was carried
      out double-blind. Knee extension torque and vertical jumping height were
      evaluated. Lean tissue cross-sectional area (LCSA) and the relative proportion of
      fat within the muscle compartment were measured for the quadriceps and lower leg 
      muscles. The ExHRT group showed significant increases in knee extension torque
      (8.3%) and vertical jumping height (17.2%) when compared with the Co group
      (-7.2%). Vertical jumping height also increased after HRT alone (6.8%). The LCSA 
      of the quadriceps was increased significantly in the HRT (6.3%) and ExHRT (7.1%) 
      groups when compared with the Ex (2.2%) and Co (0.7%) groups. Lower leg LCSA was 
      also increased in the ExHRT group (9.1%) when compared with the Ex (3.0%) and Co 
      (4.1%) groups. In addition, the increase in the relative proportion of fat in the
      quadriceps in the Co group (16.6%) was significant compared with those in the HRT
      (4.9%) and ExHRT (-0.6%) groups. Thus, in post-menopausal women, muscle
      performance, muscle mass and muscle composition are improved by HRT. The
      beneficial effects of HRT combined with high-impact physical training may exceed 
      those of HRT alone.

TI  - Sexually and well-being in early menopause. Effect of transdermal estradiol
      therapy.
PG  - 115-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study focus on the effect of 6 months transdermal estradiol
      therapy (TTS) on the sexual behaviour and the quality of life in early menopausal
      women, complaining of uncomfortable menopausal symptoms. METHODS: Three hundred
      and sixty-two postmenopausal women, aged 48-56, participated in this study. One
      hundred and seventy-one of them were given continuous solid matrix patch TTS 50
      mg/day for 6 months. Sexual behaviour, menopausal symptoms and well-being were
      evaluated through a self-rating method. We used a structured questionnaire with
      three obligatory answers (less/same/more) for each question--sexual life, hot
      flushes, touchiness, insomnia, blood pressure, work willing, memory loss,
      well-being--filled in by the women themselves or by the medical equipe after a
      telephone interview. RESULTS: Seventy five per cent of women aged 51-53 and 84%
      aged 54-56, who had been treated for 6 months with TTS showed a fall of sexual
      drive, if compared with, respectively, 62% and 48% of untreated subjects. Relief 
      of hot flushes, touchiness and insomnia occurred in 80% of treated women, with
      slight differences among the various groups while 61% showed increase of
      well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study demonstrate that continuous TTS
      for 6 months decreased sexual drive in 69% of women, improved menopausal symptoms
      in 80% women but increased well-being only in 61% of women. These differences
      suggest that women's well-being does not seem linked only to the relief of
      menopausal symptoms and the impairment of their sexual life can play a negative
      role.

      test. Subjects were allocated into two groups: 23 women received an OC containing
      20 microg of ethinyl-estradiol and 150 mg of desogestrel for 21 days and then 7
      placebo tablets (placebo group); the other 33 women received 21 tablets with the 
      same hormone combination, followed by 2 placebo tablets and 5 ethinyl-estradiol
      tablets of 10 microg each (estrogen group). After three cycles, symptoms were
      reassessed. RESULTS: Symptoms were similar in the two groups at the start of the 
      study. Three months later, vasomotor symptoms in the placebo group dropped from
      3.3 +/- 1.7 to 1.7 +/- 1.8, and in the estrogen group, from 3.0 +/- 1.7 to 0.7
      +/- 0.9 (p < 0.04). Similarly, symptoms of depression fell from 8.8 +/- 4.0 to
      6.7 +/- 3.9 in the placebo group and from 10.3 +/- 3.5 to 3.8 +/- 2.9 in the
      estrogen group (p < 0.002). Somatic symptoms fell with placebo from 10.9 +/- 5.3 
      to 7.4 +/- 5.4, and with estrogen, from 9.7 +/- 4.9 to 4.0 +/- 2.5 (p < 0.03).
      Sexual dysfunction as measured by the Greene Scale (loss of sexual interest) also
      improved more in women who received additional estrogen: 2.0 +/- 0.9 to 0.5 +/-
      0.9 vs. 1.8 +/- 1.2 to 1.2 +/- 1.2, p < 0.03. Anxiety symptoms improved in both
      groups but without any significant difference between them. CONCLUSIONS: Adding 5
      days of estrogen to the classic contraceptive scheme improves the climacteric
      symptoms of perimenopausal women who use OCs.

TI  - Esterified estrogens combined with methyltestosterone improve emotional
      well-being in postmenopausal women with chest pain and normal coronary
      angiograms.
PG  - 233-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The cardiac syndrome X is described as the triad of angina pectoris, a
      positive exercise test for myocardial ischemia, and angiographically smooth
      coronary arteries. Although syndrome X does not result in an increased risk of
      cardiovascular mortality, the symptoms are often troublesome and unresponsive to 
      conventional antianginal therapy. The majority of patients are postmenopausal,
      and estrogen therapy can alleviate anginal symptoms. We investigated the effect
      of esterified estrogens combined with methyltestosterone (Estratest) on quality
      of life in postmenopausal women with syndrome X. DESIGN: Patients were withdrawn 
      from antianginal therapy. Sublingual nitrates were allowed for treatment of
      anginal episodes. Patients underwent treadmill testing, and quality of life was
      assessed by using the Short Form-36 and Cardiac Health Profile questionnaires
      after the women had received 8 weeks of Estratest or identical placebo in a
      randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were
      randomized, and 16 patients completed the protocol. Plasma 17beta-estradiol
      concentrations were significantly increased by Estratest; however, total
      testosterone levels were not. The "emotional" score of the Cardiac Health Profile
      questionnaire was significantly improved after Estratest use compared with
      placebo (p = 0.03); however, there was no significant change in the Short Form-36
      questionnaire for any variable. Estratest significantly increased systolic blood 
      pressure and rate pressure product at rest but had no effect on exercise
      parameters. Time to onset of chest pain during exercise was also unaffected.
      CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a beneficial effect of Estratest on emotional
      well-being in postmenopausal women with cardiological syndrome X. There was no
      significant treatment effect on exercise parameters, including time to onset of
      chest pain.

TI  - Testosterone supplementation improves spatial and verbal memory in healthy older 
      men.
PG  - 80-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between exogenous testosterone
      administration and cognitive abilities in a population of healthy older men.
      BACKGROUND: Serum levels of total and bioavailable testosterone gradually
      decrease with age in men and are associated with reductions in muscle mass,
      osteoporosis, decreased sexual activity, and changes in cognition. METHODS:
      Twenty-five healthy, community-dwelling volunteers, aged 50 to 80 years,
      completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants
      received weekly intramuscular injections of either 100 mg testosterone enanthate 
      or placebo (saline) for 6 weeks. Cognitive evaluations were conducted at
      baseline, week 3, and week 6 of treatment by use of a battery of neuropsychologic
      tests. RESULTS: Circulating total testosterone was raised an average of 130% from
      baseline at week 3 and 116% at week 6 in the treatment group. Because of
      aromatization of testosterone, estradiol increased an average of 77% at week 3
      and 73% at week 6 in the treatment group. Significant improvements in cognition
      were observed for spatial memory (recall of a walking route), spatial ability
      (block construction), and verbal memory (recall of a short story) in older men
      treated with testosterone compared with baseline and the placebo group, although 
      improvements were not evident for all measures. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest 
      that short-term testosterone administration enhances cognitive function in
      healthy older men. However, it remains unclear whether these improvements in
      cognition are attributable to increased testosterone or estradiol levels, or
      both. The potential role of testosterone vs its metabolites on cognition requires
      further research.

TI  - Effects of wild yam extract on menopausal symptoms, lipids and sex hormones in
      healthy menopausal women.
PG  - 144-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Many women seek alternatives to hormonal therapies for the management
      of menopausal symptoms. Among the treatments currently popular are extracts of
      wild yam (Dioscorea villosa), which are applied topically in the form of a cream.
      These preparations are known to contain steroidal saponins, including diosgenin, 
      which has been claimed to influence endogenous steroidogenesis. However, there
      have been no studies of the safety or efficacy of these preparations in the
      management of menopausal symptoms. METHODS: We therefore conducted a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of the effects of a wild yam
      cream in 23 healthy women suffering from troublesome symptoms of the menopause.
      After a 4-week baseline period, each woman was given active cream and matching
      placebo for 3 months in random order. Diaries were completed over the baseline
      period and for 1 week each month thereafter, and blood and saliva samples were
      collected at baseline and at 3 and 6 months, for measurement of lipids and
      hormones. RESULTS: The average age of the subjects was 53.3 +/- 1.1 (SEM) years
      and average time since last period 4.3 +/- 0.9 years. At baseline, the average
      body mass index was 27.3 +/- 0.8, cholesterol level 5.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/l and
      follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 74.2 +/- 5.1 IU/l; estradiol levels were
      undetectable in the majority of cases. After 3 months of treatment, no
      significant side-effects were reported with either active treatment or placebo,
      and there were no changes in weight, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or
      levels of total serum cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
      cholesterol, FSH, glucose, estradiol, or serum or salivary progesterone. Symptom 
      scores showed a minor effect of both placebo and active treatment on diurnal
      flushing number and severity and total non-flushing symptom scores, and on
      nocturnal sweating after placebo, but no statistical difference between placebo
      and active creams. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that short-term treatment
      with topical wild yam extract in women suffering from menopausal symptoms is free
      of side-effects, but appears to have little effect on menopausal symptoms. It
      emphasizes the importance of careful study of treatments for menopausal symptoms 
      if women are to be adequately informed about the choices available to them.

TI  - Effects of gonadal steroids on peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in
      women with PMS and controls.
PG  - 539-49
AB  - BACKGROUND: GABA receptor-modifying neurosteroids may play a role in premenstrual
      syndrome (PMS). The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) both regulates the
      formation of neurosteroids and is, in animals, regulated by ovarian steroids.
      Alterations in PBR density have been observed in association with several
      psychiatric disorders. METHODS: We examined the effects of gonadal steroids on
      lymphocytic PBR density in nine women with prospectively confirmed PMS and nine
      controls. PBR densities were measured during three pharmacologically controlled
      conditions: gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (Lupron)-induced hypogonadism,
      Lupron plus estradiol, and Lupron plus progesterone replacement. Blood samples
      were obtained after six weeks of Lupron alone and after 3-4 weeks of estradiol
      and progesterone replacement. RESULTS: No significant hormone state-related
      changes in PBR density were observed (ANOVA-R: phase-F(2,32)=1.5, P=0.2). Despite
      mood symptom development in the subjects with PMS, PBR density did not differ in 
      women with PMS compared to controls across hormonal states (ANOVA-R: F(1,16)=0.6,
      P=0.4). CONCLUSIONS: PBR densities are not altered in women with PMS and are not 
      changed significantly by selective gonadal steroid administration. Changes in PBR
      density would not appear to underlie the differential sensitivity to the mood
      destabilizing effects of ovarian steroids in PMS.

TI  - Sensitivity to a neurosteroid is increased during addition of progestagen to
      postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy.
PG  - 397-407
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacodynamic response to a
      neuroactive steroid, pregnanolone, before and during different hormonal settings 
      of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Twenty-seven postmenopausal 
      women with climacteric symptoms were administered HRT in a randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study. The women received 2 mg
      estradiol (E2) continuously during four 28-day cycles and 10 mg
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 1 mg norethisterone acetate (NETA) or placebo 
      sequentially for the last 14 days in each cycle. The pharmacodynamic response to 
      pregnanolone was assessed before treatment and during the last week of each
      treatment, by comparing the effects of intravenous pregnanolone
      (3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one) on saccadic eye velocity (SEV), saccade
      deceleration, saccade latency and self-rated sedation. Throughout the study daily
      symptom rating scales were kept. During the progesta gen phase of the treatment
      cycles, negative mood symptoms and physical symptoms were increased, whereas
      positive mood symptoms were decreased. Compared to pretretreatment conditions, E2
      alone did not change the responsiveness to pregnanolone. During progestagen
      addition to E2, the responsiveness to pregnanolone was increased. The sedation
      response increased compared to pretreatment conditions during both E2 + MPA and
      E2 + NETA treatment. Compared to E2 treatment alone, addition of MPA increased
      the postpregnanolone effect on saccade deceleration, whereas the SEV response to 
      pregnanolone was increased during E2 + NETA treatment. It is concluded that
      pregnanolone sensitivity increases together with deterioration in mood symptoms
      during addition of progestagen to HRT.

      evaluation study participants.
PG  - 3111-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that risk factors related to lifetime estrogen
      exposure predict breast cancer incidence and to test if any subgroups experience 
      enhanced benefit from raloxifene. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with
      osteoporosis (N = 7,705), enrolled onto the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene
      Evaluation (MORE) trial, were randomly assigned to receive placebo, raloxifene 60
      mg/d, or raloxifene 120 mg/d for 4 years. Breast cancer risk was analyzed by the 
      following baseline characteristics indicative of estrogen exposure: previous
      hormone replacement therapy, prevalent vertebral fractures, family history of
      breast cancer, estradiol level, bone mineral density (BMD), body mass index, and 
      age at menopause. Therapy-by-subgroup interactions were assessed using a logistic
      regression model. RESULTS: Overall, women with the highest one-third estradiol
      levels (> or = 12 pmol/L) had a 2.07-fold increased invasive breast cancer risk
      compared with women with lower levels. Raloxifene significantly reduced breast
      cancer risk in both the low- and high-estrogen subgroups for all risk factors
      examined (P <.05 for each comparison). The women with the highest BMD and those
      with a family history of breast cancer experienced a significantly greater
      therapy benefit with raloxifene, compared with the two thirds of patients with
      lower BMD or those without a family history, respectively; the
      subgroup-by-therapy interactions were significant (P =.005 and P =.015,
      respectively). CONCLUSION: The MORE trial confirms that increased lifetime
      estrogen exposure increases breast cancer risk. Raloxifene therapy reduces breast
      cancer risk in postmenopausal osteoporotic women regardless of lifetime estrogen 
      exposure, but the reduction is greater in those with higher lifetime exposure to 
      estrogen.

TI  - Physiology of hot flashes.
PG  - 453-64
AB  - Hot flashes are the most common symptom of the climacteric, although prevalence
      estimates are lower in some rural and non-Western areas. The symptoms are
      characteristic of a heat-dissipation response and consist of sweating on the
      face, neck, and chest, as well as peripheral vasodilation. Although hot flashes
      clearly accompany the estrogen withdrawal at menopause, estrogen alone is not
      responsible since levels do not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic
      women. Until recently it was thought that hot flashes were triggered by a sudden,
      downward resetting of the hypothalamic setpoint, since there was no evidence of
      increased core body temperature. Evidence obtained using a rapidly responding
      ingested telemetry pill indicates that the thermoneutral zone, within which
      sweating, peripheral vasodilation, and shivering do not occur, is virtually
      nonexistent in symptomatic women but normal (about 0.4 degrees C) in asymptomatic
      women. The results suggest that small temperature elevations preceding hot
      flashes acting within a reduced thermoneutral zone constitute the triggering
      mechanism. Central sympathetic activation is also elevated in symptomatic women
      which, in animal studies, reduces the thermoneutral zone. Clonidine reduces
      central sympathetic activation, widens the thermoneutral zone, and ameliorates
      hot flashes. Estrogen virtually eliminates hot flashes but its mechanism of
      action is not known.

TI  - [The effect of hormonal replacement therapy on symptoms of climacteric syndrome
      and selected metabolic parameters].
PG  - 113-20
AB  - GOAL OF STUDY: The goal of this paper was estimation of influence of HRT (after 3
      and 6 months of treatment of 112 women) the symptoms of climacteric syndrome and 
      depression associated with the said syndrome based on the scales of Kupperman,
      Green, Hamilton and Beck as well as some selected parameters of metabolic
      state--concentration of foloculotropic hormonal profile FSH and 17 beta-estradiol
      E2, lipid profile (TC, HDL, LDL, TG-A) and glucose concentration. CONCLUSIONS: 1.
      The implementation of hormonal replacement therapy on 112 women made it possible 
      to conclude that the treatment caused withdrawal of symptoms of climacteric
      syndrome and depression associated with the said syndrome. 2. Hormonal
      Replacement Therapy to a great extent had a beneficial influence on the lipid
      profile with 112 women after menopause especially as far as LDL is concerned. 3. 
      HRT caused enormously significant increase in 17 beta-estradiol concentration and
      decrease of FSH concentration. 4. HRT statistically had no impact on glucose
      level with the study group of women.

TI  - Course of primary headaches during hormone replacement therapy.
PG  - 157-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate how hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) could influence the course of primary headaches in postmenopausal
      women. METHODS: Fifty patients presenting for clinical evaluation of menopausal
      status and suffering from headache were enrolled. The observational period lasted
      7 months during which women filled in a diary with the clinical characteristics
      of headache attacks (frequency, days with headache, severity) and the analgesic
      use (no. of analgesic/month). Climacteric symptoms and both anxiety and
      depression were also measured. At the first visit the patients were divided into 
      two groups: those suffering from migraine without aura (MwA) and those suffering 
      from episodic tension-type headache (ETTH) and separately randomized. After a
      month of run-in period, they received two different HRT regimen, either: (1)
      transdermal estradiol 50 mcg every 7 days for 28 days plus medroxyprogesterone
      acetate (MAP) 10 mg/day from 15th to 28th day, or (2) oral conjugated estrogens
      0.625 mg/day for 28 days plus MAP 10 mg/day for the last 14 days. Follow up
      evaluations were planned after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: While we 
      did not observe any significance change regarding headache parameters in ETTH
      patients during both transdermal and oral treatment, the course of migraine was
      significantly affected by the route of HRT. Both frequency of attacks (F = 8.5; P
      < 0.000) and days with headache (F = 6.9; P < 0.000) significantly increased
      during HRT in the subgroup assuming oral formulation. On the contrary, no changes
      in the same parameters were found in the group taking transdermal treatment.
      Moreover, while severity of migraine was unaffected by HRT, analgesic consumption
      was significantly increased in the subgroup on oral treatment (F = 6.3; P =
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HRT significantly affects the course of headache in
      postmenopausal migraine sufferers. Indeed, while the clinical pattern of ETTH
      remained stable throughout the observational period, patients suffering from MwA 
      worsened their symptoms within the first 3 months of treatment. In particular,
      the oral route of administration significantly worsened migraine in comparison to
      the transdermal route.

PG  - 238-45
AB  - The influence of a combined estrogen-progestin regimen (Climodien) on noopsyche, 
      thymopsyche, personality and psychophysiological measures of menopausal syndrome 
      patients was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative,
      randomized 3-arm trial phase (Climodien 2/3 = estradiol valerate (CAS 979-32-8) 2
      mg + the progestin dienogest (CAS 65928-58-7) 3 mg = regimen A, estradiol
      valerate 2 mg = regimen EV, and placebo = regimen P) followed by an open-label
      phase in which all patients received Climodien 2/2 (estradiol valerate 2 mg +
      dienogest 2 mg) = regimen A*. 49 women (16, 17, 16 valid patients per arm) aged
      between 46 and 67 years (mean 58, 58, 56 years, respectively) with the diagnoses 
      of insomnia (G 47.0) related to postmenopausal syndrome (N 95.1) were included in
      the analysis of the double-blind phase. Both the double-blind and the open-label 
      phase lasted 2 months. Noopsychic investigations demonstrated an improvement in
      associative verbal memory after 2 months of regimen A, which was significant as
      compared with both baseline and placebo. Regarding visual memory, regimen A*
      induced an improvement, which was significantly different from the decline in
      correct reproductions in the Benton Test observed under estradiol. Errors in the 
      Benton Test decreased significantly after regimen A* as compared with regimen EV.
      These findings suggest that hormone replacement therapy with estradiol, and even 
      more in combination with dienogest, improves verbal and visual memory, which is
      in line with the improvement in information processing speed and capacity
      objectified by event-related potentials (ERP). Thymopsychic investigations
      demonstrated a significant improvement in somatic complaints and trait anxiety
      after both regimen A and regimen EV as compared with baseline. State anxiety
      decreased significantly under regimen A* as compared with EV. The Freiburger
      Personality Inventory showed an improvement in aggressivity after regimen A* as
      compared with the preceding placebo as well as an improvement in striving after
      dominancy after both regimen A and regimen EV as compared with pre-treatment, but
      also after regimen A* as compared with regimen EV. Extraversion increased after 2
      months of regimen A as compared to regimen P. Psychophysiological findings
      including pupillary and skin conductance variables were not significant.

TI  - Effects of estrogen/androgen therapy on bone mineral density parameters.
PG  - 325-31
AB  - Although estrogen's efficacy in reversing loss of bone mineral density (BMD) has 
      been extensively documented, the role of androgens in preserving and restoring
      BMD is less well understood. Estrogen/androgen (E/A) therapy is especially
      important for surgically menopausal women. This population group experiences
      marked bone loss in response to the dramatic decline in ovarian hormones. The
      resulting hormonal profile differs significantly from that of naturally
      menopausal women. For surgically menopausal women, the relation of estrogens,
      androgens and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is of special concern, as the
      interrelation between these hormones ultimately may reduce hormonal
      bioavailability. This paper reviews the relation of bone metabolism to ovarian
      hormones and the mechanics of BMD loss as well as the tools available to
      clinicians to assess bone loss in menopausal women. It further discusses androgen
      excess in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Currently available hormonal
      regimens to preserve bone are described, including estrogen-only therapy, E/A
      therapy, tibolone and estrogen-progestogen therapy.

TI  - Estrogen replacement therapy and nocturnal periodic limb movements: a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 548-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of estrogen replacement therapy on nocturnal
      periodic limb movements in a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled,
      crossover trial. METHODS: Seventy-one healthy postmenopausal women volunteered in
      answer to a newspaper announcement; 62 women completed the follow-up. Frequency
      of nocturnal body movements was measured with the static-charge-sensitive bed and
      all-night polysomnographic recordings. Serum estradiol (E2) and FSH
      concentrations were also measured at baseline and after each treatment period.
      The power of the study setup was 94%. RESULTS: Nearly half the women presented
      with episodes of periodic limb movements (30 of 62 women, or 48%, during placebo 
      and 27, or 44%, during estrogen therapy). In 17 (27%) during placebo and 19 (31%)
      during estrogen therapy, frequency of periodic limb movements exceeded index
      level 5 per hour while subjects were in bed. Incidence or intensity of movements,
      movement durations, and movement intervals did not change with estrogen therapy. 
      The arousal index was similar during the two treatments (medians = 1.7 for
      placebo and 1.3 for estrogen, P =.758). Variations in serum E2 concentration,
      age, and body mass index did not explain variations in movement activity.
      CONCLUSION: Estrogen replacement therapy in doses used to control climacteric
      symptoms does not alter the incidence or intensity of nocturnal periodic limb
      movements.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of a novel oral constant
      estrogen plus intermittent progestogen hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimen 
      to a continuous combined HRT regimen in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Subjects
      were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either constant 17beta-estradiol
      (E2), 1 mg, plus intermittent norgestimate (NGM) 90 microg (3 days off, 3 days
      on) (n=221) or E2 2 mg/norethisterone acetate (NETA) 1 mg (n=217) for 1 year.
      Treatments were evaluated based on the incidence of hot flushes and uterine
      bleeding. RESULTS: Both regimens had similar bleeding profiles and provided
      comparable vasomotor symptom relief. However, breast discomfort and edema were
      experienced by twice as many subjects who received E2/NETA. CONCLUSIONS: The
      constant E2/intermittent NGM regimen was well tolerated and possesses similar
      efficacy compared with a continuous combined E2/NETA regimen and may be
      considered whenever HRT without withdrawal bleeding is deemed appropriate.

AB  - In the present study the acute anti-ischemic effect of clinically relevant doses 
      of transdermal estradiol during concurrent antianginal therapy was investigated
      in 14 postmenopausal women with stable coronary artery disease. Plasma estradiol 
      was significantly increased, but no significant effects on time to angina, time
      to 1 mm S--T depression, total exercise time, maximum rate-pressure product,
      maximum S--T depression or maximum workload were found. However, resting
      diastolic blood pressure was significantly decreased due to estrogen.

TI  - Evidence that cyproterone acetate improves psychological symptoms and enhances
      the activity of the dopaminergic system in postmenopause.
PG  - 608-12
AB  - The psychological symptoms assessed with a validated psychometric scale, SCL-90, 
      were significantly higher in postmenopausal women (PMW; 60 subjects) than in
      premenopausal women (20 subjects). In the same PMW, the activity of the
      dopaminergic system, assessed with the PRL response to the dopamine-blocking
      agent sulpiride, was significantly lower than that in premenopausal women. During
      a period of 12 weeks the 60 PMW were randomly divided into 3 groups: no treatment
      (group A; n = 20), treatment with estradiol (E(2)) alone (patches with a E(2)
      release of 50 microg/24 h; group B; n = 20), and treatment with hormonal
      replacement therapy [estradiol valerate (EV) at a daily dose of 2 mg for 11 days 
      and EV at the same daily doses plus cyproterone acetate (CPA) at a daily dose of 
      1 mg/day for 10 days; group C; n = 20). At the 12th week of the observation, only
      in group C women were the psychological symptoms significantly decreased, and the
      indirect evaluation of the dopaminergic system activity through PRL response to
      sulpiride showed a significant increase. During the same period, no changes in
      testosterone levels were observed in any group of PMW, whereas a significant
      increase in E(2) levels was found in both groups B and C. Although it is likely
      that the improvement in psychological symptoms with EV and CPA was due to
      progestin, we cannot rule out the possibility that greater estrogen exposure may 
      have played a role.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of fully transdermal hormone replacement in sequential 
      or continuous therapy at two doses of progestogen in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 83-93
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Two randomized open-label studies were performed to evaluate fully
      transdermal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with oestradiol (E2) and
      norethisterone acetate (NETA) in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Both hormones
      were delivered by transdermal matrix patches changed twice weekly. Subjects
      received E2, 50 microg/day and NETA, 170 microg/day or 350 microg/day, either
      continuously or sequentially. A one-year study (13 cycles of 28 days), including 
      a reference regimen of transdermal E2 and sequential oral progestogen, was
      followed by a continuation study for a further year in 367 women. RESULTS: All
      regimens were highly and equally effective in the prevention of hot flushes. The 
      fully transdermal regimens were associated with beneficial changes in the lipid
      profile. The sequential regimens provided effective scheduling of bleeding around
      the end of the progestogen phase. The continuous regimens were associated with
      irregular bleeding, which was rarely severe, and a gradually increasing incidence
      of amenorrhoea. With sequential or continuous therapy, bleeding was less severe
      at the lower dose of progestogen than at the higher dose. No endometrial
      hyperplasia was detected by biopsy in any treatment group. One serous endometrial
      carcinoma and one endometrial adenocarcinoma were detected. An endometrial
      thickness >5 mm did not predict the presence of hyperplasia at biopsy.
      Hormone-related adverse events were typical of those expected for HRT and dermal 
      tolerability of the patches was good. CONCLUSIONS: Fully transdermal sequential
      or continuous HRT is effective and well tolerated in postmenopausal women. The
      lower dose of NETA may be preferable, because it confers adequate endometrial
      protection at a lower dose of progestogen.

TI  - The effect of varying low-dose combinations of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl 
      estradiol (femhrt) on the frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptoms.
PG  - 383-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a significant reduction in frequency and
      severity of hot flashes in symptomatic postmenopausal women who are administered 
      continuously different dose combinations of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl
      estradiol. DESIGN: Two randomized clinical trials (Study 1 and Study 2) were
      conducted in which study participants recorded in daily diaries the frequency of 
      their hot flashes. Study 2 participants also recorded the number of mild,
      moderate, or severe hot flashes they experienced. In Study 1, a total of 219
      postmenopausal women reporting vasomotor symptoms were placed randomly into
      groups to receive either a placebo or 1 of 4 treatments (0.2 mg/1 microg; 0.5
      mg/2.5 microg; 1 mg/5 microg; or 1 mg/10 microg norethindrone acetate/ethinyl
      estradiol). In Study 2, a total of 266 highly symptomatic postmenopausal women
      were placed randomly to receive either a placebo or 1 of 3 treatment groups [0.5 
      mg/2.5 microg; 1 mg/5 microg; or 1 mg/10 microg norethindrone acetate
      (NA)/ethinyl estradiol (EE)]. Total duration of treatment was 16 weeks in Study 1
      and 12 weeks in Study 2. Study 1 subjects had to have at least 10 hot flashes
      during the week before randomization. Study 2 subjects had to have at least 56
      moderate to severe hot flashes during the week before randomization. RESULTS: In 
      both studies, there was a dose-related decrease in hot flash frequency with the
      highest dose (1 mg NA/10 microg EE) group that had the greatest response.
      Significant differences from placebo (p < 0.05, Dunnett's test) occurred within 4
      weeks in Study 1 for hot flash frequency with a percent reduction in frequency
      ranging from 33% for placebo to 84% for both the 1 mg NA/10 microg EE and 1 mg
      NA/5 microg EE dose groups. Likewise, Study 2 significant reductions in hot flash
      frequency occurred by Week 2 for 1 mg NA/10 microg EE, Week 3 for 1 mg NA/5
      microg EE, and Week 5 for 0.5 mg NA/2.5 microg EE (p < 0.05, Dunnett's test).
      This dose effect was also apparent with regard to severity. In addition, more
      subjects had clinically meaningful reductions in hot flash frequency or
      elimination as the dose combinations increased. CONCLUSION: There were
      significant reductions in hot flash frequency and severity with continuous
      treatment with norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol combinations. The time
      at which significant reductions were observed, as well as the magnitude of the
      response, were dose dependent. The opportunity for lower-dose options of a new
      continuous-combined hormone replacement therapy provides therapeutic flexibility 
      for women who are recently menopausal.

TI  - [Influence of hormone replacement therapy on the quality of life in
      postmenopausal women with hypertension].
PG  - 397-401
AB  - AIM: The effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the quality of life in
      women with hypertension is still not clear. Thus, the aim of the study was to
      assess the effect of hormone replacement therapy on quality of life in
      postmenopausal women with essential hypertension by using a battery of
      standardized questionnaires. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted
      of 53 women (mean age 50.9 +/- 6.3 years) with mild and moderate essential
      hypertension (mean duration 6.4 +/- 6.4 years). The postmenopausal status was
      defined as the absence of menstrual blood loss during > 6 months and blood
      estradiol concentration < 50 pg/ml, accompanied by follicle-stimulating hormone
      (FSH) levels > 21 U/I. Twenty seven women were blindly randomised to transdermal 
      hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and received 17-beta-estradiol and
      noretisterone acetate, TTS. Twenty six women were randomly selected as controls. 
      The subjects were evaluated at baseline (after 2 weeks' wash-out from hypotensive
      drug period) and after three months of HRT using self-administered standardized
      quality of life questionnaires: the Psychological General Well-being Index (PGWB)
      and the Subjective Symptoms Assessment Profile (SSA-P). RESULTS: No differences
      were found in blood pressure values, heart rate, body mass index and distribution
      of body fat tissue between women receiving HRT and controls at baseline and after
      3 months of follow-up. There were no significant differences in the baseline
      total PGWB score as well as in its subscale between two groups. Similarly, the
      frequency and intensity of subjective symptoms assessed by SSA-profile were the
      same in both groups at baseline. After 3 months, a significant improvement in
      PGWB total score was observed in women receiving HRT. This effect was due to
      improvement in anxiety, positive well-being and vitality. Moreover, emotional
      distress, symptoms of flushing, sweating and trembling hands also diminished and 
      sexual capacity improved in women treated with HRT. CONCLUSION: A three-month
      hormone replacement therapy in hypertensive postmenopausal women slightly
      improves the general well-being, seems to decrease emotional tension, increase
      sexual capacity and markedly relieves some vasomotor symptoms.

TI  - The effect of estrogen replacement therapy on cardiac autonomic regulation.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and sleep
      stage on autonomic cardiac regulation. SRUDY DESIGN: Seventy-one healthy
      postmenopausal women received transdermal ERT and placebo separated by a washout 
      in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial.
      Polysomnography was conducted at the end of each treatment. Heart rate
      variability (HRV) was assessed in epochs of the awake state, stage 2, slow wave
      and REM sleep. The effects of estradiol and sleep stages on HRV were analyzed.
      RESULTS: ERT decreased heart rate in the awake state and quiet sleep, but not in 
      REM sleep. ERT did not change the heart rate variability. Heart rate decreased
      and HRV increased during stage 2 and slow wave sleep compared with the awake
      state with placebo. In REM sleep, similarly, heart rate increased above awake
      values and the values of HRV parameters fell back to awake levels. CONCLUSIONS:
      The results suggest that ERT increases vagal tone, but does not change cardiac
      vagal modulation. Changes in HRV suggest a strong vagal influence in non-REM and 
      a sympathetic influence in REM sleep.

TI  - Triphasic norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol for treating dysfunctional uterine
      bleeding.
PG  - 913-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a triphasic combination oral contraceptive 
      (OC) containing norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol (E2) and placebo in the
      treatment of metrorrhagic, menometrorrhagic, oligomenorrheic, and polymenorrheic 
      dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized,
      double-masked study, 201 women (15-50 years of age) with DUB received triphasic
      norgestimate-ethinyl E2 or placebo, for three consecutive 28-day treatment
      cycles. Efficacy was determined by evaluating investigator and subject
      assessments of DUB resolution, abnormal uterine bleeding patterns during an
      84-day reference period, and change from baseline in subjects' quality of life.
      The sample size was based on the assumption that the proportions of subjects
      exhibiting treatment success (percentage of subjects with investigator and
      subject overall assessments of DUB resolution of "improved") were 65% for the
      active group and 40% for the placebo group (alpha = 0.05, 1 - beta = 0.80).
      RESULTS: More than 80% of subjects receiving triphasic norgestimate-ethinyl E2
      had improvements in their abnormal bleeding patterns as assessed by
      investigators, and the subjects themselves compared with fewer than 50% of
      subjects in the placebo treatment group (P <.001). Abnormal bleeding patterns
      were reported by significantly fewer subjects receiving triphasic
      norgestimate-ethinyl E2 than in the placebo treatment group (P <. 001). Change
      from baseline in physical functioning (eg, self-care, walking, lifting,
      exercising) was significantly more improved in the triphasic norgestimate-ethinyl
      E2 group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: The triphasic combination of
      norgestimate and ethinyl E2 is an effective treatment for metrorrhagic,
      menometrorrhagic, oligomenorrheic, and polymenorrheic dysfunctional uterine
      bleeding.

PG  - 906-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and patient acceptability of intranasal versus
      transdermal 17 beta-estradiol (E2) delivery systems for postmenopausal symptoms. 
      METHODS: Postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to intranasal 17 beta-E2,
      300 microg daily (n = 176) or transdermal 17 beta-E2 (delivering 50 microg/day), 
      two patches per week (n = 185) for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week period with the
      alternate treatment. Efficacy was compared between groups using the Kupperman
      Index and vasomotor symptoms at week 12. Patient acceptability was compared by
      patient choice of administration route and by questionnaire at week 16. RESULTS: 
      Intranasal and transdermal therapy produced significant reductions in the
      Kupperman Index and in the occurrence of hot flushes and night sweats at week 12.
      Alleviation of climacteric symptoms was statistically equivalent in the two
      treatment groups (P <.001). The difference between groups in the Kupperman Index 
      score of -0.5 +/- 0.9 (95% confidence interval -2.3, 1.3) was within the
      predetermined interval of equivalence. Both therapies were well tolerated with
      similar adverse event rates, except for moderate and severe mastalgia which was
      significantly less frequent with intranasal E2 (7.2%) than with the patch (15.5%,
      P =.02). Sixty-six percent of patients chose to continue the intranasal therapy
      and 34% the transdermal therapy (P <.001). Satisfaction was greater with
      intranasal therapy at week 16 (P <.001). CONCLUSION: Intranasal and transdermal
      estrogen delivery systems had equivalent efficacy and similar safety profiles.
      Intranasal therapy was the patients' choice for long-term treatment.

TI  - The effect of tibolone versus continuous combined norethisterone acetate and
      oestradiol on memory, libido and mood of postmenopausal women: a pilot study.
PG  - 223-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several studies have shown a positive effect of oestrogen on memory,
      mood and well-being but these data are controversial and focus particularly on
      the effect of oestrogen alone. In this pilot study we have investigated the
      effect of a continuous combination of norethisterone acetate 1 mg and oestradiol 
      valerate 2 mg (Kliogest) versus tibolone (Livial) on memory, sexuality and mood. 
      METHODS: Twenty-two postmenopausal women, age range 51-57, were randomised to a 6
      months single blind interventional study treatment with either continuous
      combined oestradiol plus norethisterone acetate, or tibolone. Computerised
      psychological test of memory, mood and libido were administered both before and
      at the end of the 6 months treatment. RESULTS: Fourteen patients completed the
      study; eight on Livial and six on Kliogest. Recognition memory was improved by
      Kliogest but not by Livial (P<0.05) while either drug equally improved both the
      reaction time (P<0.01) and accuracy of performance (P<0.001) of categorical
      semantic memory. Both the treatments improved libido significantly (P<0.05),
      while the mood did not change with either. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that
      both these forms of hormonal replacement therapy improve the efficiency of memory
      performance and libido. However, a combination of oestradiol and norethisterone
      acetate seems to be marginally more effective on improving cognitive processes.

TI  - The effects of transdermal estradiol on the response to mental stress in
      postmenopausal women: a randomized trial.
PG  - 463-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Estrogens inhibit adrenomedullary catecholamine release and
      catecholamine-mediated responses to stress. We examined whether estrogen
      supplementation reduces the sympathoadrenal response to mental stress in
      postmenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the effects of 3-week
      treatment with transdermal 17-beta-estradiol and placebo in 10 postmenopausal
      women using a randomized, blinded, crossover design. We measured plasma
      catecholamine levels and the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to a
      15-minute stress with mental arithmetic. Treatments were compared using repeated 
      measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: During placebo treatment, mean (+/- SD)
      epinephrine levels reached a peak of 431 +/- 135 pmol/liter after 15 minutes of
      stress; the epinephrine response was blunted during estradiol treatment, with a
      peak of 357 +/- 77 pmol/liter (P <0.05). Estradiol also blunted the diastolic
      blood pressure response to stress (baseline levels of 78 +/- 15 mm Hg vs peak of 
      90 +/- 6 mm Hg during placebo; baseline of 80 +/- 8 mm Hg vs peak of 84 +/- 6 mm 
      Hg during estradiol; P <0.05). Estradiol treatment also blunted the decrease in
      the standard deviation of the mean of the electrocardiographic RR intervals and
      the increase in the ratio between the low-frequency and high-frequency
      bandwidths. CONCLUSION: We observed a moderate, although significant, reduction
      in markers of the stress response to mental arithmetic in postmenopausal women
      treated with transdermal 17-beta-estradiol.

TI  - Resting ECG is modified after oophorectomy and regresses with estrogen
      replacement therapy in premenopausal women.
PG  - 43-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of bilateral oophorectomy on the resting ECG and
      whether they regress with estrogen replacement therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six 
      premenopausal and 15 postmenopausal women were enrolled in the present study. All
      women had undergone hysterectomy and bilateral ovariectomy. All women underwent
      12-lead ECG on admission to hospital. A second ECG was recorded 20-25 days after 
      surgery. After this second ECG, premenopausal women were randomly divided into
      two groups. The women of Group A (n=14) received transdermal ethinyl estradiol
      (EE). The women of Group B (n=12) did not receive any therapy. A third ECG was
      performed in both groups 30-35 days after randomization. RESULTS: Bilateral
      oophorectomy did not induce any significant modifications in the ECG parameters
      of the postmenopausal women whereas in the premenopausal women, we observed a
      significant increment in mean duration of the T wave, a significant decrease in
      its amplitude and significant reduction in ST depression in V2, V3, V4 and V5.
      The third ECG showed regression of the ECG modifications in Group A. In the women
      of Group B, the second and third ECGs were not substantially different, but there
      were statistically significant differences between the first and third ECGs.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that ovariectomy induces
      significant though not clinically evident modifications in resting ECG. These ECG
      changes are probably due to the sudden reduction in sex hormone plasma levels
      after ovariectomy. Administration of estradiol induced regression of the ECG
      modifications.

TI  - Alendronate for the treatment of osteoporosis in men.
PG  - 604-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite its association with disability, death, and increased medical
      costs, osteoporosis in men has been relatively neglected as a subject of study.
      There have been no large, controlled trials of treatment in men. METHODS: In a
      two-year double-blind trial, we studied the effect of 10 mg of alendronate or
      placebo, given daily, on bone mineral density in 241 men (age, 31 to 87 years;
      mean, 63) with osteoporosis. Approximately one third had low serum free
      testosterone concentrations at base line; the rest had normal concentrations. Men
      with other secondary causes of osteoporosis were excluded. All the men received
      calcium and vitamin D supplements. The main outcome measures were the percent
      changes in lumbar-spine, hip, and total-body bone mineral density. RESULTS: The
      men who received alendronate had a mean (+/-SE) increase in bone mineral density 
      of 7.1+/-0.3 percent at the lumbar spine, 2.5+/-0.4 percent at the femoral neck, 
      and 2.0+/-0.2 percent for the total body (P<0.001 for all comparisons with base
      line). In contrast, men who received placebo had an increase in lumbar-spine bone
      mineral density of 1.8+/-0.5 percent (P<0.001 for the comparison with base line) 
      and no significant changes in femoral-neck or total-body bone mineral density.
      The increase in bone mineral density in the alendronate group was greater than
      that in the placebo group at all measurement sites (P<0.001). The incidence of
      vertebral fractures was lower in the alendronate group than in the placebo group 
      (0.8 percent vs. 7.1 percent, P=0.02). Men in the placebo group had a 2.4-mm
      decrease in height, as compared with a decrease of 0.6 mm in the alendronate
      group (P=0.02). Alendronate was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In men
      with osteoporosis, alendronate significantly increases spine, hip, and total-body
      bone mineral density and helps prevent vertebral fractures and decreases in
      height.

      norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (E2) on vaginal bleeding, spotting,
      or bleeding and/or spotting in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Two randomized
      clinical trials were conducted in which participants recorded information on the 
      daily occurrence of vaginal bleeding or spotting. In study 1, 219 postmenopausal 
      women reporting at least ten hot flushes per week were randomized to placebo or
      one of four treatment groups (0.2 mg norethindrone acetate/1 microg ethinyl E2,
      0.5 mg norethindrone acetate/2.5 microg ethinyl E2, 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 
      microg ethinyl E2, or 1 mg norethindrone acetate/10 microg ethinyl E2). In study 
      2, 266 postmenopausal women reporting at least 56 moderate to severe hot flushes 
      were randomized to placebo or one of three treatment groups (0.5 mg norethindrone
      acetate/2.5 microg ethinyl E2, 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 microg ethinyl E2, or
      1 mg norethindrone acetate/10 microg ethinyl E2). The total duration of treatment
      was 16 weeks in study 1 and 12 weeks in study 2. In both studies, subjects
      reported in daily diaries whether they had either bleeding or spotting. RESULTS: 
      In study 1, there was a significantly greater relative risk (RR) for bleeding in 
      the group receiving 1 mg norethindrone acetate/10 microg ethinyl E2 at study
      weeks 4 and 8 (RR = 1.36 and 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01, 1.83; RR = 1.37
      and 95% CI 1.1, 1.72; respectively) compared with placebo, but not at study weeks
      12 or 16. The group receiving 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 microg ethinyl E2 also
      had a significantly greater risk at weeks 4 and 8 (RR = 1.5 and 95% CI 1.15,
      1.96; RR = 1.33 and 95% CI 1.00, 1.77; respectively), whereas the other dose
      combinations did not differ from placebo. Results from study 2 were similar to
      those of study 1. CONCLUSION: Although there was a greater risk for bleeding
      and/or spotting at the higher doses of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl E2, this
      risk declined over time. If compliance with hormone replacement therapy regimens 
      is influenced at least in part by vaginal bleeding, the combined norethindrone
      acetate/ethinyl E2 regimen investigated in these studies may provide a treatment 
      option.

TI  - Raloxifene and estrogen effects on quality of life in healthy postmenopausal
      women: a placebo-controlled randomized trial.
PG  - 359-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of raloxifene, estrogen, and placebo on quality 
      of life in healthy, asymptomatic, postmenopausal women. METHODS: In a
      multicenter, double-blind, 12-month study, 398 women were assigned randomly to
      one of four groups: raloxifene HCl, 60 (n = 97) or 150 mg/day (n = 100);
      conjugated equine estrogens, 0. 625 mg/day (n = 96); or placebo (n = 105). The
      Women's Health Questionnaire, a validated quality-of-life instrument for
      perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, was administered at baseline and 3-month
      intervals. RESULTS: Overall, quality of life from baseline to end point was
      preserved equally in all treatment groups. Six domains (depressed mood, somatic
      symptoms, memory/concentration, sexual behavior, sleep problems, and perceived
      attractiveness) were unchanged in all groups. Three domains (menstrual symptoms, 
      vasomotor symptoms, and anxiety/fears) were statistically significantly different
      among groups. Mean scores for menstrual symptoms significantly worsened and
      vasomotor symptoms significantly improved from baseline to end point in the
      estrogen group. Mean scores for vasomotor symptoms did not worsen at any point in
      the raloxifene 60 mg/day group. Mean anxiety/fears scores improved significantly 
      during raloxifene 60 mg/day administration throughout treatment (P <.05),
      irrespective of previous hormone replacement therapy, baseline estradiol (E2)
      levels, or years postmenopause. CONCLUSION: Most quality-of-life domains were not
      affected by treatment with estrogen or raloxifene. Estrogen provided relief from 
      vasomotor symptoms but caused menstrual symptoms. Raloxifene 60 mg/day improved
      anxiety levels in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Sex steroids modify working memory.
PG  - 407-14
AB  - In the last ten years, numerous mechanisms by which sex steroids modify cortical 
      function have been described. For example, estrogen replacement improves verbal
      memory in women, and animal studies have shown effects of estrogen on hippocampal
      synaptogenesis and function. Little is known about sex steroid effects on other
      aspects of memory, such as frontal lobe-mediated working memory. We examined the 
      relationships between working memory and sex steroid concentrations and whether
      sex steroid supplementation would modify age-related loss of working memory in
      older men and women. Before hormone supplementation, working memory, tested with 
      the Subject Ordered Pointing Test (SOP), was worse in older subjects than younger
      subjects, and there was no evidence of gender differences at either age.
      Testosterone supplementation improved working memory in older men, but a similar 
      enhancement of working memory was not found in older women supplemented with
      estrogen. In men, testosterone and estrogen effects were reciprocal - with better
      working memory related to a higher testosterone to estrogen ratio. These results 
      suggest that sex steroids can modulate working memory in men and can act as
      modulators of cognition throughout life.

TI  - Analysis of the bleeding pattern in assisted reproduction cycles with luteal
      phase supplementation using vaginal micronized progesterone.
PG  - 1435-9
AB  - This study was designed to determine the effects of a vaginal micronized
      progesterone preparation on bleeding patterns and pregnancy outcomes after
      in-vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI). The study
      population consisted of 149 consecutive women who had undergone IVF-ICSI using
      'long-protocol' stimulation with buserelin-human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG). 
      A retrospective chart analysis of computerized medical records was undertaken.
      Vaginal progesterone (200 mg three times daily) was begun the day before oocyte
      retrieval and continued for a minimum of 16-19 days following human chorionic
      gonadotrophin (HCG) administration. Occurrence of bleeding following HCG
      injection, pregnancy rate and outcomes, and serum concentrations of oestradiol
      were measured. Women undergoing IVF and embryo transfer with ICSI and using
      vaginal progesterone for luteal support had normal luteal phase lengths (day of
      HCG minus day of onset of bleeding). In the absence of pregnancy, bleeding
      occurred after 19.2 +/- 3.9 days (mean +/- SD). Out of the pregnant group only
      three women bled within 19 days of HCG administration: two had biochemical
      pregnancies which spontaneously vanished and one evolved to term. The results
      reflect the normal bleeding pattern to be expected when vaginal progesterone is
      used for luteal support in IVF and embryo transfer, an approach whose efficacy
      has been amply proven. No shortened luteal phases were observed using vaginally
      administered progesterone.

TI  - [Long-term side-effects following cyproterone acetate containing therapy in
      gynecology].
PG  - 268-73
AB  - It has been suggested that cyproterone acetate (CPA) has a mutagenic potency. It 
      has been postulated that a threshold dosage of CPA has mutagenic effects, but in 
      the same way data have been published documenting that a continuous low dosage of
      cyproterone acetate leads to a reduction of mutagenic episodes. Despite published
      data about higher levels of DNA adduct creations due to CPA an international
      multicentre study analysing 2,506 patients with 7,971 patient-years that used CPA
      could not find any liver cell cancers, even if due to epidemiological data 6
      liver cell cancers should have occurred upon this study group. The present study 
      deals with the evaluation of 57 women which received CPA in combination with EE2 
      11-13 years before. The daily dosage was 2 mg CPA in combination with 35 mg or 50
      mg EE2. In Germany these drugs were registered under the name of Diane 35 or
      Diane 50. Long-term follow-up evaluation concerning side effects, especially the 
      appearance of liver cell carcinomas, were the aim of this study. With the records
      of 32% (18/57) of the above mentioned patient group the following long-term
      follow-up side effects could be observed: 1) weight gain, 2) headache, 3)
      migraine, 4) gastrointestinal disorders, 5) mood affections/depressions, 6)
      oedema of the legs, 7) skin affections, 8) mastodynia. No benign liver tumor or
      liver cell carcinoma was detected upon our group of investigated patients. In
      conclusion we can affirm that the use of CPA in a dosage of 2 mg per day does not
      lead to serious side effects under long-term follow-up observation conditions and
      that it's use does not correlate with a higher appearance of liver cell
      carcinomas.

TI  - Effects of gonadal steroids in women with a history of postpartum depression.
PG  - 924-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endocrine factors are purported to play a role in the etiology of
      postpartum depression, but direct evidence for this role is lacking. The authors 
      investigated the possible role of changes in gonadal steroid levels in postpartum
      depression by simulating two hormonal conditions related to pregnancy and
      parturition in euthymic women with and without a history of postpartum
      depression. METHOD: The supraphysiologic gonadal steroid levels of pregnancy and 
      withdrawal from these high levels to a hypogonadal state were simulated by
      inducing hypogonadism in euthymic women-eight with and eight without a history of
      postpartum depression-with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprolide 
      acetate, adding back supraphysiologic doses of estradiol and progesterone for 8
      weeks, and then withdrawing both steroids under double-blind conditions. Outcome 
      measures were daily symptom self-ratings and standardized subjective and
      objective cross-sectional mood rating scales. RESULTS: Five of the eight women
      with a history of postpartum depression (62.5%) and none of the eight women in
      the comparison group developed significant mood symptoms during the withdrawal
      period. Analysis of variance with repeated measures of daily and cross-sectional 
      ratings of mood showed significant phase-by-group effects. These effects
      reflected significant increases in depressive symptoms in women with a history of
      postpartum depression but not in the comparison group after hormone withdrawal
      (and during the end of the hormone replacement phase), compared with baseline.
      CONCLUSIONS: The data provide direct evidence in support of the involvement of
      the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone in the development of
      postpartum depression in a subgroup of women. Further, they suggest that women
      with a history of postpartum depression are differentially sensitive to
      mood-destabilizing effects of gonadal steroids.

TI  - Identification of early postmenopausal women with no bone response to HRT:
      results of a five-year clinical trial.
PG  - 211-8
AB  - Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prevents postmenopausal bone loss and
      fractures. However, the occurrence of women with no bone response to HRT has not 
      been widely examined. We identified the densitometric nonresponders to long-term 
      HRT and investigated some characteristics and biochemical variables as possible
      predictors of densitometric nonresponse in postmenopausal women. The study
      population was a subsample of the Kuopio Osteoporosis Study (n = 14,220). A total
      of 464 early postmenopausal women were randomized into four treatment groups: (1)
      HRT (sequential combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg cyproterone
      acetate); (2) vitamin D3; (3) HRT + Vitamin D3 combined; and (4) placebo. In this
      study, the data from HRT and placebo groups were analyzed. Lumbar (L2-4) and
      femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) were determined by dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and after 5 years of treatment. A densitometric 
      nonresponder was defined as a woman whose 5-year BMD change was similar to the
      mean BMD change (+95% CI) of the placebo group or worse. Altogether, 74 women in 
      the HRT group and 104 women in the placebo group complied with the treatment.
      According to spinal BMD analysis, 11% of the women were classified as
      densitometric nonresponders; the corresponding proportion for femoral BMD
      analysis was 26%. Both smoking (p = 0.003) and low body weight (p = 0.028) were
      significant risk factors for densitometric nonresponse to HRT. After 6 months of 
      treatment the densitometric nonresponders (hip) had a significantly higher mean
      serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level (p = 0.038) and lower increases in
      serum estradiol levels (p = 0.006) than the densitometric responders. The mean
      changes in serum FSH and alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly lower
      among the densitometric nonresponders (spine) than responders (p = 0.043 and
      0.017, respectively). In conclusion, this prospective study shows that especially
      current smokers and women with low body weight are at increased risk of poor bone
      response to HRT. Repeated serum FSH, estradiol and alkaline phosphatase
      measurements during the first months of long-term HRT may be helpful in
      identifying the women with no bone response to HRT.

TI  - The effects of 3-week estrogen hormone replacement on cognition in elderly
      healthy females.
PG  - 129-39
AB  - RATIONALE: Estrogen concentrations decline with age and menopause is often
      followed by an acceleration of the age effects on cognition. It is suggested that
      replacement of estrogen would reinstate, at least in part, cognitive abilities.
      Effects of estrogens on memory have been reported in studies with women in a
      clinical setting who either needed or wished to have the estrogen replacement and
      are mostly in the perimenopausal age-band. OBJECTIVE: The present study
      investigated the effects of estradiol on memory and on frontal lobe function in
      elderly female subjects who did not suffer any of the postmenopausal symptoms and
      had never taken estrogen hormone replacement (EHR) previously. METHODS: EHR
      (Progynova TS, transdermal estradiol; n=19) or placebo (n=18) was given for a
      period of 3 weeks to elderly healthy female subjects. Memory, frontal lobe
      functions (inhibition and planning) and visuospatial abilities (mental rotation) 
      were tested before and after treatment. Estrogen plasma levels were measured to
      confirm the result of EHR. Cortisol plasma levels were also measured before and
      after cognitive performance in order to evaluate the effects of EHR on the
      sensitivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to mild mental
      stress. RESULTS: Plasma estradiol levels in the drug group increased to levels
      equivalent to that of a fertile woman (0.21+/-0.5 nmol/l). Memory function as
      well as visuospatial abilities as measured by a mental rotation task improved
      significantly with EHR. However, there was no effect of EHR on frontal lobe
      functions. The cognitive effects were not dependent on an improvement in mood or 
      general well-being as may be the case with EHR in women at peri- or
      post-menopausal stage. EHR was found to increase the HPA response to task-induced
      stress, as indicated by an increase in cortisol plasma levels. CONCLUSIONS: The
      present study has provided evidence of a beneficial effect of EHR on cognitive
      abilities given for first time to healthy elderly women. Furthermore, the present
      study has demonstrated a differential effect of EHR on memory, visuospatial
      abilities and frontal lobe function.

TI  - Estrogen modifies the temperature effects of progesterone.
PG  - 1643-9
AB  - To test the hypothesis that progestin-mediated increases in resting core
      temperature and the core temperature threshold for sweating onset are
      counteracted by estrogen, we studied eight women (24 +/- 2 yr) at 27 degrees C
      rest, during 20 min of passive heating (35 degrees C), and during 40 min of
      exercise at 35 degrees C. Subjects were tested four times, during the early
      follicular and midluteal menstrual phases, after 4 wk of combined
      estradiol-norethindrone (progestin) oral contraceptive administration (OC E+P),
      and after 4 wk of progestin-only oral contraceptive administration (OC P). The
      order of the OC P and OC E+P were randomized. Baseline esophageal temperature
      (T(es)) at 27 degrees C was higher (P < 0.05) in the luteal phase (37.08 +/- 0.21
      degrees C) and in OC P (37.60 +/- 0.31 degrees C) but not during OC E+P (37.04
      +/- 0.23 degrees C) compared with the follicular phase (36.66 +/- 0.21 degrees
      C). T(es) remained above follicular phase levels throughout passive heating and
      exercise during OC P, whereas T(es) in the luteal phase was greater than in the
      follicular phase throughout exercise (P < 0.05). The T(es) threshold for sweating
      was also greater in the luteal phase (38.02 +/- 0.28 degrees C) and OC P (38.07
      +/- 0.17 degrees C) compared with the follicular phase (37.32 +/- 0.11 degrees C)
      and OC E+P (37.46 +/- 0.18 degrees C). Progestin administration raised the T(es) 
      threshold for sweating during OC P, but this effect was not present when estrogen
      was administered with progestin, suggesting that estrogen modifies
      progestin-related changes in temperature regulation. These data are also
      consistent with previous findings that estrogen lowers the thermoregulatory
      operating point.

      parameters in symptomatic postmenopausal women: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial. Swedish Alternative Medicine Group.
PG  - 89-99
AB  - A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel group study was performed to
      assess the effects of a standardized ginseng extract compared with those of a
      placebo on quality of life (QoL) and on physiological parameters in symptomatic
      postmenopausal women. Validated questionnaires [Psychological General Well-Being 
      (PGWB) index, Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ)] and Visual Analogue (VA) scales
      were used to assess the effects of the extract on QoL at baseline and after 16
      weeks' treatment with either the ginseng extract or placebo. To assess the
      efficacy of ginseng on postmenopausal symptoms, physiological parameters
      [follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels, endometrial thickness, 
      maturity index and vaginal pH] were recorded at the same time points. Of the 384 
      randomized patients (mean age 53.5 +/- 4.0 years), the questionnaires were
      completed by 193 women treated with ginseng and 191 treated with placebo. With
      regard to the primary endpoint (total score of the PGWB index) the extract showed
      only a tendency for a slightly better overall symptomatic relief (p < 0.1).
      Exploratory analysis of PGWB subsets, however, reported p-values < 0.05 for
      depression, well-being and health subscales in favor of ginseng compared with
      placebo. No statistically significant effects were seen for the WHQ and the VA
      scales or the physiological parameters, including vasomotor symptoms (hot
      flushes). The positive effects of ginseng on health-related QoL in menopausal
      women should be further investigated. This study shows, however, that the
      beneficial effects of ginseng are most likely not mediated by hormone
      replacement-like effects, as physiological parameters such as FSH and estradiol
      levels, endometrial thickness, maturity index and vaginal pH were not affected by
      the treatment.

TI  - Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate, and aging: contribution of the
      DHEAge Study to a sociobiomedical issue.
PG  - 4279-84
AB  - The secretion and the blood levels of the adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone 
      (DHEA) and its sulfate ester (DHEAS) decrease profoundly with age, and the
      question is posed whether administration of the steroid to compensate for the
      decline counteracts defects associated with aging. The commercial availability of
      DHEA outside the regular pharmaceutical-medical network in the United States
      creates a real public health problem that may be resolved only by appropriate
      long-term clinical trials in elderly men and women. Two hundred and eighty
      healthy individuals (women and men 60-79 years old) were given DHEA, 50 mg, or
      placebo, orally, daily for a year in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. No
      potentially harmful accumulation of DHEAS and active steroids was recorded.
      Besides the reestablishment of a "young" concentration of DHEAS, a small increase
      of testosterone and estradiol was noted, particularly in women, and may be
      involved in the significantly demonstrated physiological-clinical manifestations 
      here reported. Bone turnover improved selectively in women >70 years old, as
      assessed by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) technique and the
      decrease of osteoclastic activity. A significant increase in most libido
      parameters was also found in these older women. Improvement of the skin status
      was observed, particularly in women, in terms of hydration, epidermal thickness, 
      sebum production, and pigmentation. A number of biological indices confirmed the 
      lack of harmful consequences of this 50 mg/day DHEA administration over one year,
      also indicating that this kind of replacement therapy normalized some effects of 
      aging, but does not create "supermen/women" (doping).

TI  - Testosterone and cognition in elderly men: a single testosterone injection blocks
      the practice effect in verbal fluency, but has no effect on spatial or verbal
      memory.
PG  - 650-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relevance of the age-associated decline in testosterone for
      cognition in elderly men is still poorly understood. One hypothesis is that
      testosterone enhances spatial abilities, while it might impair verbal skills.
      METHODS: Thirty elderly men received a single testosterone (250 mg testosterone
      enanthate) or placebo injection. Cognitive performance was tested before and 5
      days after treatment using spatial as well as verbal tests. RESULTS: Five days
      after injection, testosterone and estradiol levels were still in the
      supraphysiologic range. In the verbal fluency task, the placebo group, but not
      the testosterone group, showed a practice effect. Therefore, the testosterone
      group performed significantly worse than the placebo group after treatment. No
      effects of testosterone were observed in the other verbal and spatial tasks.
      CONCLUSIONS: The present finding, that testosterone blocks the practice effect in
      verbal fluency, partly supports the general idea that sex steroids modulate
      performance in tests with known gender differences. Moreover it demonstrates that
      these effects can occur rapidly. However, beneficial effects on spatial cognition
      or memory might need more time to develop and/or might only occur when a less
      pronounced testosterone increase is induced.

TI  - Comparative effects of estrogens plus androgens and tibolone on bone, lipid
      pattern and sexuality in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 161-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main goals of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) are the
      prevention of osteoporosis and cardioprotection and the improvement of quality of
      life (QL). Androgens and tibolone therapy may increase bone mineral density (BMD)
      to a greater extent than ERT and offer an increase in QL. Lipid and
      cardiovascular effects, however, are still a major concern. AIM: To evaluate
      whether the addition of a weak androgen to ERT may improve postmenopausal bone
      loss and sexual activity without adverse effects on lipid pattern and to compare 
      these effects with those observed after tibolone therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS:
      This prospective study enrolled 120 surgical postmenopausal women; of these, 96
      completed the 1-year follow-up. Patients were allocated to one of four groups.
      The first group (A; n = 23) received 4 mg of estradiol valerate plus 200 mg of
      enanthate of dihydroandrosterone im monthly. The second group (E; n = 26)
      received 50 microg/day of transdermal 17-b-estradiol continuously; the third (T; 
      n = 23) received 2.5 mg of tibolone every day; and finally, the fourth group (C; 
      n = 24) constituted a treatment-free control group. Bone mass (dual X-ray
      absorptiometry), serum total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides,
      apolipoproteins A1 and B and sexual activity were evaluated before starting
      therapy and at the end of follow-up. RESULTS: All active treatment groups showed 
      an increase in BMD. This increase was higher in the A treatment group (4.08% P < 
      0.01). Sexuality improved significantly with therapy; however, tibolone and
      androgens increased scores to a greater extent than ERT. Androgen therapy was
      associated with significant increases in total cholesterol, LDL and
      triglycerides. Cholesterol and LDL fall into groups E and T, HDL into groups A
      and T and triglycerides in group T only. CONCLUSION: The combined regimen of
      androgens and ERT increased vertebral bone mass and enhance sexual activity in
      postmenopausal women equal to that of tibolone and to a greater extent than ERT
      alone; its effects on lipids, however, are clearly adverse.

TI  - Estrogen effects on postural balance in postmenopausal women without vasomotor
      symptoms: a randomized masked trial.
PG  - 278-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether estrogen treatment given to postmenopausal women
      without vasomotor symptoms improves balance more than placebo. METHODS: Forty
      healthy postmenopausal women without vasomotor symptoms were randomized to
      transdermal 17beta-estradiol (E2) 50 microg/day for 14 weeks or identical
      transdermal placebo patches. Postural balance was measured with dynamic
      posturography before and after 4, 12, and 14 weeks of therapy. In this test, the 
      visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems were provoked with increasing
      difficulty and body sway was measured with a dual forceplate. A low score showed 
      large sway and a score of 100 showed no sway at all. RESULTS: Thirty-eight women 
      completed the study. Both groups had normal balance for their ages and near
      maximum scores in the three easier balance tests at baseline. In the most
      difficult test, both groups improved their postural balance significantly (from
      13 to 32 and from 22 to 39, respectively) after 4 weeks. Thereafter, no change
      was seen. One problem was low statistical power, but the relative change in
      balance did not differ between groups. The comparison did not show even a minute 
      advantage of E2 over placebo, so a study with higher power would probably not
      have shown a more pronounced effect of estrogen than placebo. The change over
      time did not differ between groups, which indicates a significant learning
      effect. CONCLUSION: In women without vasomotor symptoms, estrogen therapy did not
      seem to increase postural balance significantly more than placebo. However, we
      could not rule out that estrogens affect postural balance in women with vasomotor
      symptoms.

TI  - Calcium absorption in postmenopausal osteoporosis: benefit of HRT plus
      calcitriol, but not HRT alone, in both malabsorbers and normal absorbers.
PG  - 43-51
AB  - In a randomized trial involving 71 postmenopausal osteoporotic women with
      vertebral compression fractures, radiocalcium absorption studies using the (45)Ca
      single isotope method (alpha) were performed at baseline and after 8 months of
      treatment with either continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT, as
      piperazine estrone sulfate 0.625-0.937 mg daily +/- medroxyprogesterone acetate
      2.5 mg daily depending on uterine status) or HRT plus calcitriol 0. 25 microg
      twice daily. A calcium supplement of 600 mg nocte was given to only those women
      who had a daily calcium intake of less than 1 g per day at baseline, as assessed 
      by recalled dietary intake. There was a significant decrease [0.74 (+/- 0.35 SD) 
      to 0.58 (+/- 0. 22), Dalpha = -0.17 (+/- 0.26), p<0.0005] in alpha at 8 months
      compared with baseline in the HRT-treated group, but a significant increase [0.68
      (+/- 0.31) to 0.84 (+/- 0.27), Dalpha = +0.16 (+/- 0. 30), p<0.003] in the
      HRT-plus-calcitriol treated patients, resulting in alpha being significantly
      higher after 8 months in the latter group than in the HRT-only group. Although
      72% of the patients had been supplemented with calcium between the first and
      second studies, separate analyses revealed that the change in calcium intake had 
      not affected the result. Further breakdown of the groups into baseline 'normal'
      absorbers (alpha >/=0.55) and 'malabsorbers' (alpha <0.55) revealed that alpha
      decreased with HRT treatment only in the normal absorbers, and remained stable in
      the malabsorbers. Conversely, following HRT plus calcitriol treatment, alpha
      increased only in the malabsorbers, the normal absorbers in this group remaining 
      unchanged. In conclusion, our data show that HRT, of the type and dose used in
      this study, did not produce an increase in absorption efficiency; it was in fact 
      associated with a fall. Increased absorption efficiency cannot be achieved unless
      calcitriol is used concurrently, and then only in patients with malabsorption.
      Calcitriol also had a significant effect in normal absorbers in that it prevented
      the decline in alpha seen with HRT alone, and thus should be considered in all
      patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with HRT.

TI  - Psychological and endocrine responses to psychosocial stress and
      dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone in healthy postmenopausal women and
      young controls: the impact of age and a two-week estradiol treatment.
PG  - 422-30
AB  - In this placebo-controlled double-blind study, psychological and endocrine stress
      responses were investigated in healthy postmenopausal placebo-treated women (n = 
      15; 60-75 years; placebo via transdermal patches), healthy postmenopausal
      estradiol-treated women (n = 13; 60-79 years; 0.1 mg 17beta-estradiol daily via
      transdermal patches) and young controls (n = 15; 20-31 years; untreated). The
      aged subjects received estradiol or placebo treatment for 14 days. All subjects
      were then exposed to the 'Trier Social Stress Test' (TSST) and the dexamethasone 
      (Dex)-human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH) test (100 microgram hCRH after
      premedication with 1.5 mg Dex). Psychological parameters including perceived
      stressfulness, mood and subjective well-being were measured by visual analog
      scales, a mood questionnaire and a mood diary, respectively. Results show that
      the TSST induced significant increases in adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), free
      salivary cortisol, total plasma cortisol and heart rates (all p < 0.0001).
      Regardless of age, comparable hormonal response patterns were observed in the
      TSST as indicated by similar peak levels and recovery phases. Visual analog
      scales confirmed that the same amount of stress was experienced by young and
      elderly subjects. In both age groups, hCRH injection after Dex premedication
      provoked significant increases in ACTH, free salivary cortisol and total plasma
      cortisol (all p < 0.0001). In contrast to the psychosocial stressor, elderly
      women were found to respond with a markedly enhanced cortisol response compared
      to young controls in the Dex-CRH test (p < 0.025). Additional investigation of
      morning cortisol profiles could not reveal any age-related differences in basal
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Following estradiol
      treatment, estradiol levels significantly increased only in substituted
      postmenopausal women (p < 0.001) reaching concentrations typically found in
      younger women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.
      Corticosteroid-binding globulin levels did not differ significantly between
      groups. When confronted with the TSST, no response differences emerged between
      the three groups. However, estradiol treatment appeared to blunt the total plasma
      cortisol response in the Dex-CRH test, resulting in smaller increases in
      untreated premenopausal women and estradiol-treated postmenopausal women compared
      to placebo-treated postmenopausal women (p < 0.02). In sum, no response
      differences were observed after confrontation with a psychosocial stress test in 
      our sample of healthy elderly subjects. As shown with the Dex-CRH test, our data 
      suggest that the negative feedback of the HPA axis in elderly women is altered.
      Moreover, the current data suggest that estradiol replacement may modulate HPA
      feedback sensitivity in humans.

      lipid profiles.
PG  - 1012-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of two doses of conjugated equine estrogen
      (CEE) and two of esterified estrogen plus methyltestosterone (E + A) in
      surgically menopausal women. STUDY DESIGN: A two-year, parallel-group,
      double-blind study of 311 women who were randomly assigned to one of four
      regimens: (1) CEE, 0.625 mg/d; (2) CEE, 1.25 mg/d; (3) esterified estrogens,
      0.625 mg, + methyltestosterone, 1.25 mg/d; or (4) esterified estrogens, 1.25, +
      methyltestosterone, 2.5 mg/d. Study parameters were symptoms, lipids, bone
      mineral density, side effects and safety. RESULTS: All treatments prevented loss 
      of bone in the spine and hip. The higher E + A dose increased spine and hip BMD
      more than other treatments (P < .002). All treatments improved menopausal
      symptoms, with non-significantly greater improvements in well-being and sexual
      interest in the E + A groups. Similar and significant decreases in low-density
      lipoprotein were observed in all groups, but high-density lipoprotein and
      triglycerides were increased only in the unopposed estrogen groups (P < .05).
      Hirsutism was uncommon and similar in all groups at two years. Discontinuation
      rates and reasons for withdrawal from the study were similar in both groups. No
      clinically significant side effects or laboratory test abnormalities were seen.
      CONCLUSION: As compared to estrogen alone, E + A significantly improved BMD and
      was well tolerated in surgically menopausal women.

TI  - Nucleated red blood cells in healthy infants of women with gestational diabetes.
PG  - 84-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether absolute nucleated red blood cell (RBC) counts are
      elevated in large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants of women with gestational
      diabetes compared with appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) infants of women
      with or without gestational diabetes. METHODS: We compared absolute nucleated RBC
      counts during the first 12 hours of life in three groups of term, vaginally
      delivered infants, LGA infants of women with gestational diabetes (n = 20), AGA
      infants of women with gestational diabetes (n = 20), and AGA infants of
      nondiabetic women (n = 30). We excluded infants of women with hypertension,
      smoking, alcohol or drug abuse, and those with fetal heart rate abnormalities in 
      labor, low Apgar scores, hemolysis, blood loss, or chromosomal anomalies.
      RESULTS: There were no significant differences among groups in gestational age,
      gravidity, parity, maternal analgesia, 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, and
      lymphocyte counts. Corrected white blood cell counts and hematocrit were
      significantly higher in LGA infants of women with gestational diabetes than in
      the other groups. The median nucleated RBC count was significantly higher in LGA 
      infants of women with gestational diabetes (0.56 x 10(9)/L, range 0-1.8 x
      10(9)/L) than AGA infants of women with gestational diabetes (0.13 x 10(9)/L,
      range 0-0.65 x 10(9)/L) and controls (0.0005 x 10(9)/L, range 0-0.6 x 10(9)/L) (P
      < .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that absolute nucleated RBC count
      was significantly correlated with birth weight (or macrosomia) and maternal
      diabetic status (r2 = .25, P < .001 for the multiple regression, contribution of 
      birth weight r2 = .19, and diabetes r2 = .06). CONCLUSION: At birth, term LGA
      infants born to women with gestational diabetes had higher absolute nucleated RBC
      counts compared with AGA infants born to women with gestational diabetes and
      controls.

TI  - Efficacy on climacteric symptoms of a new estradiol transdermal patch with active
      matrix in comparison with a reference reservoir patch. Two long-term randomized
      multicenter parallel-group studies.
PG  - 933-43
AB  - METHODS: Two randomized prospective multicentre parallel group studies were
      performed (one in Germany and the other in Italy) in symptomatic postmenopausal
      women. The goal was to assess the efficacy on climacteric symptoms and the safety
      of a new estradiol (CAS 50-28-2) transdermal patch with solid active matrix (SAM)
      in comparison to a conventional liquid reservoir (LR) type estradiol transdermal 
      patch. Both patches released 50 micrograms/day estradiol. One group of patients
      received the SAM patch and the other the LR patch in 4-week cycles, with a
      twice-weekly application of the patches for 3 weeks, followed by one week without
      patches. Progestin opposition was achieved with medroxyprogesterone acetate 5
      mg/day orally in the last 11 days of patch application in the German study and
      with 10 mg/day in the last 12 days of patch application in the Italian study.
      Both studies were divided into two Parts: Part 1 with three 4-week cycles for a
      total of 12 weeks and Part 2 for other ten 4-weeks cycles in which the patches
      could be applied also continuously. The total duration of the study was therefore
      52 weeks. RESULTS: Germany study. 133 patients resulted randomized to the SAM
      group and 129 to the LR group. Both estradiol patches quickly relieved
      climacteric symptoms already during the first 3 weeks of patch application, as
      shown by the rapid decrease of the Kupperman Index. At the end of Part 1, in the 
      SAM group 91% and in the LR group 96% of patients reported relief from
      climacteric symptoms. At the end of Part 2 the percentages were 98% and 95%,
      respectively. The two patches were therapeutically equivalent with a power
      greater than 99.7%. Both patches were systemically fairly well tolerated. Only
      4.5% of patients in the SAM group and 3.9% in the LR group discontinued
      prematurely for possible adverse reactions related to estradiol. There was no
      significant difference between the two patches with regard to systemic
      tolerability. Conversely, with regard to local skin reactions, the SAM patch was 
      significantly (p < 0.01) better tolerated than the LR patch. The adhesion to the 
      skin of the SAM patches was better than that of the LR patches. RESULTS. Italian 
      study. 139 patients resulted randomized to the SAM patch and 128 to the LR patch.
      Also in this study both types of patches relieved the climacteric symptoms
      already during the first 3 weeks of patch application, as shown by the rapid
      decrease of the visual analogue scale (VAS) recordings of severity of hot flushes
      and of sweats. At the end of Part 1 both patches relieved 95% of patients from
      climacteric symptoms. At the end of Part 2, i.e. after 52 weeks, 100% of patients
      were relieved from climacteric symptoms. Of these, 72% in the SAM group and 78%
      in the LR group reported complete disappearance of symptoms. Also in the Italian 
      study, therefore, the two patches were found therapeutically equivalent. Both
      patches stopped or even reversed bone mineral loss in L2-L4 and had some
      favorable effects on lipid metabolism. Both patches were systemically equally
      fairly well tolerated with premature discontinuations for systemic adverse drug
      reactions in only 5.0% of patients in the SAM group and 3.9% in the LR group.
      Conversely, as in the German study, the SAM patches were significantly better
      tolerated by the skin (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The two types of estradiol
      transdermal patches were equivalent in providing an effective and rapid relief
      from climacteric symptoms. Systemically both patches were fairly well tolerated. 
      The SAM patches were significantly better tolerated by the skin. The better local
      tolerability combined with better adhesion and cosmetic properties render the SAM
      patches very patient friendly and improve the compliance in the long term
      estrogen replacement therapy required to reduce osteoporosis and cardiovascular
      risks.

TI  - The effect of dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation to symptomatic
      perimenopausal women on serum endocrine profiles, lipid parameters, and
      health-related quality of life.
PG  - 3896-902
AB  - Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an androgenic steroid hormone, exhibits an
      age-related decline. Perimenopausal women have only approximately 50% of peak
      DHEA levels. Despite limited scientific data, DHEA has gained recognition as a
      dietary supplement to reduce the symptoms of aging and improve well-being. This
      randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of 50
      mg/day of oral DHEA supplementation, for 3 months, on 60 perimenopausal women
      with complaints of altered mood and well-being. Changes in the serum endocrine
      profile of women in the DHEA group were significantly greater than the placebo
      group, including a 242% [95% confidence interval (CI) +60.1, +423.9] increase in 
      DHEAS, a 94.8% (95% CI +34.2, +155.4) increase in testosterone, and a 13.2% (95% 
      CI -27.88, +0.5) decline in cortisol compared to baseline. Women receiving DHEA
      had a 10.1% (95% CI -15.0, -5.1) decline in high-density lipoprotein and an 18.1%
      (95% CI -32.2, -3.9) decline in Lp(a) from baseline, but these declines did not
      significantly differ from women who received placebo. Women receiving DHEA did
      not have any improvements significantly greater than placebo in the severity of
      perimenopausal symptoms, mood, dysphoria, libido, cognition, memory, or
      well-being. DHEA supplementation significantly effects the endocrine profile, may
      affect the lipid profile, but does not improve perimenopausal symptoms or
      well-being compared to placebo.

      transdermal system in comparison with bi-weekly injections of testosterone
      enanthate for the treatment of hypogonadal men.
PG  - 3469-78
AB  - The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of the Androderm testosterone (T)
      transdermal system (TTD) and intramuscular T enanthate injections (i.m.) for the 
      treatment of male hypogonadism were compared in a 24-week multicenter,
      randomized, parallel-group study. Sixty-six adult hypogonadal men (22-65 years of
      age) were withdrawn from prior i.m. treatment for 4-6 weeks and then randomly
      assigned to treatment with TTD (two 2.5-mg systems applied nightly) or i.m. (200 
      mg injected every 2 weeks); there were 33 patients per group. Twenty-six patients
      in the TTD group and 32 in the i.m. group completed the study. TTD treatment
      produced circadian variations in the levels of total T, bioavailable T,
      dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol within the normal physiological ranges. i.m.
      treatment produced supraphysiological levels of T, bioavailable T, and estradiol 
      (but not dihydrotestosterone) for several days after each injection. Mean morning
      sex hormone levels were within the normal range in greater proportions of TTD
      patients (range, 77-100%) than i.m. patients (range, 19-84%). Both treatments
      normalized LH levels in approximately 50% of patients with primary hypogonadism; 
      however, LH levels were suppressed to the subnormal range in 31% of i.m. patients
      vs. 0% of TTD patients. Both treatments maintained sexual function (assessed by
      questionnaire and Rigiscan) and mood (Beck Depression Inventory) at the prior
      treatment levels. Prostate-specific antigen levels, prostate volumes, and lipid
      and serum chemistry parameters were comparable in both treatment groups.
      Transient skin irritation from the patches was reported by 60% of the TTD
      patients, but caused only three patients (9%) to discontinue treatment. i.m.
      treatment produced local reactions in 33% of patients and was associated with
      significantly more abnormal hematocrit elevations (43.8% of patients) compared
      with TTD treatment (15.4% of patients). Gynecomastia resolved more frequently
      during TTD treatment (4 of 10 patients) than with i.m. treatment (1 of 9
      patients). Although both treatments seem to be efficacious for replacing T in
      hypogonadal men, the more physiological sex hormone levels and profiles
      associated with TTD may offer possible advantages over i.m. in minimizing
      excessive stimulation of erythropoiesis, preventing/ameliorating gynecomastia,
      and not over-suppressing gonadotropins.

TI  - Effects of triazolam at three phases of the menstrual cycle.
PG  - 450-8
AB  - This study investigated the subjective and behavioral effects of a commonly used 
      benzodiazepine, triazolam, in healthy women at three phases of the menstrual
      cycle: follicular, periovulatory, and luteal. Ovarian hormones or their
      metabolites have direct and indirect actions on neuronal receptors, which may
      affect responses to psychoactive drugs acting on the same central nervous system 
      receptors. This study explored the effect of menstrual cycle phase on the
      mood-altering and performance effects of a single oral dose of the benzodiazepine
      triazolam. Twenty women received triazolam (0.25 mg orally) or placebo at the
      follicular, periovulatory, and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles in a
      within-subject design. Dependent measures included self-reported mood states,
      psychomotor performance, and plasma levels of triazolam, estradiol, progesterone,
      and allopregnanolone. After administration of triazolam, most subjects reported
      the expected increases in fatigue and decreases in arousal and psychomotor
      performance. Neither plasma levels nor mood and performance effects of triazolam 
      differed across the three phases. This study illustrates a useful methodology for
      assessing responses to psychoactive drugs in normally cycling women and shows
      that the effects of this drug were highly stable across the cycle.

TI  - Liver function in postmenopausal women on estrogen-androgen hormone replacement
      therapy: a meta-analysis of eight clinical trials.
PG  - 216-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare hepatic biochemical changes of a combined estrogen-androgen
      preparation with that of estrogen alone in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Hepatic 
      biochemical values from 511 surgical and 130 nonsurgically menopausal women being
      treated with hormone replacement therapy were pooled from eight similarly
      designed studies performed between March 1988 and January 1996 comparing
      esterified estrogen-methyl-testosterone preparations with esterified estrogen,
      conjugated equine estrogens, and placebo controls. The eight studies in this
      meta-analysis were controlled, randomized, multicenter, double-blind with
      identical or similar treatment arms. For hepatic biochemistry parameters, raw
      data summaries and mean changes from baseline values with standard error (SE)
      were evaluated for the dosages and treatment groups at various time periods
      throughout the studies. RESULTS: Eight controlled trials involving 641 surgically
      and nonsurgically menopausal women were included. Changes from the pretreatment
      baseline values of liver function were compared at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months
      of therapy. No patients demonstrated hepatotoxicity or clinically significant
      elevation of liver biochemistry values. None of the liver biochemistry changes
      measured in these studies were of clinical significance, nor were there
      biochemical differences between estrogen therapy alone compared with combined
      esterified estrogen-methyltestosterone preparation when administered to
      postmenopausal women during a period of up to 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Combined
      esterified estrogen-methyltestosterone therapy (in doses of 0.625 mg esterified
      estrogen + 1.25 mg methyltestosterone or 1.25 mg esterified estrogen + 2.5 mg
      methyltestosterone) was found to be safe regarding hepatic function in
      postmenopausal women during the course of 24 months in eight controlled clinical 
      trials.

TI  - Hormone replacement therapy may alleviate sleep apnea in menopausal women: a
      pilot study.
PG  - 196-200
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The incidence of sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) in women increases after
      menopause. Progestins alone do not alleviate SAS in menopausal women. However,
      progestins may require concomitant estrogen administration and estrogen alone may
      stimulate breathing during sleep. To test these hypotheses, we studied the
      effects of estrogen alone and estrogen combined with progestin on SAS in
      menopausal women, using a prospective, cross-over, inception cohort study.
      DESIGN: In this pilot study, five women who developed SAS after menopause
      underwent 2 nights of polysomnography to obtain a baseline, then returned for
      polysomnography after 3-4 weeks of taking micronized 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and
      after 10-12 days of taking E2 combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (E2 + P).
      Sleep stages were scored according to Rechtshaffen and Kales, frequency and
      length of apneas were recorded for each subject each night, and the data were
      analyzed by Student's t test. RESULTS: E2 and E2 + P both reduced the Respiratory
      Distress Index. E2 also raised the lowest oxygen desaturation associated with
      apneic episodes. Total minutes of rapid eye movement sleep increased, and the
      number of waking episodes decreased when the women were taking E2 and E2 + P, as 
      previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: Within 1 month after initiating E2 or E2 + P,
      SAS was reduced in all patients. The Respiratory Distress Index decreased by 25%,
      and the addition of progestin brought the SAS reduction to 50% in this pilot
      study. A randomized study in a large group of patients is justified by the
      findings of this study. Because SAS increases the risk of cardiovascular disease 
      and fatal accidents, the amelioration of SAS by sex steroid hormones could have
      significant implications for the health of menopausal women.

TI  - Uterine bleeding in postmenopausal women on continuous therapy with estradiol and
      norethindrone acetate. Endometrium Study Group.
PG  - 323-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of uterine bleeding during 12 months of
      treatment with 17beta-estradiol (E2) 1 mg, unopposed or in combination with three
      doses of norethindrone acetate. METHODS: This study was a prospective,
      double-masked, randomized, multicenter trial. A total of 1176 healthy
      postmenopausal women age 45 years and older without evidence of endometrial
      abnormalities were randomly assigned to receive either unopposed E2 1 mg, or
      continuous-combined formulations of E2 1 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.1 mg,
      0.25 mg, or 0.5 mg. Any spotting or bleeding episodes during the treatment period
      were recorded in a daily diary and reported by weekly telephone calls. RESULTS:
      The incidence of bleeding was low in the combination groups, even during the
      initial 3 months of treatment (24-28%), after which it decreased with increasing 
      doses of norethindrone acetate. Conversely, the incidence of bleeding increased
      over time with unopposed E2 1 mg. After the initial 3 months, the incidence of
      bleeding among the combination groups was lowest in the norethindrone acetate 0.5
      mg group. Among women initiating therapy close to menopause, fewer reported
      bleeding with norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg than with the other combination
      groups. There was a significantly (P<.05) lower discontinuation rate due to
      bleeding in the norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg group compared with all other
      treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Continuous-combined formulations of E2 1 mg with
      norethindrone acetate 0.1, 0.25, or 0.5 mg are associated with a low incidence of
      uterine bleeding. After the initial 3 months of treatment, bleeding profiles
      improved with increasing doses of norethindrone acetate.

TI  - Two weeks of transdermal estradiol treatment in postmenopausal elderly women and 
      its effect on memory and mood: verbal memory changes are associated with the
      treatment induced estradiol levels.
PG  - 727-41
AB  - The present randomized double blind study investigated the effects of a 2 week
      transdermal estradiol treatment on memory performance in 38 healthy elderly
      women. Cognitive performance was tested at baseline and after 2 weeks of
      estradiol or placebo treatment using verbal, semantic, and spatial memory tests
      as well as a mental rotation task and the Stroop. Initial results showed no
      differences after treatment between placebo or estradiol treated subjects.
      However, within treatment group analysis revealed that estradiol treated subjects
      who reached higher estradiol levels (larger than 29 pg/ml) performed
      significantly better after treatment in the delayed recall of the paired
      associate test (verbal memory) than subjects who reached lower estradiol levels
      (P < 0.05). A nonsignificant trend was observed for the immediate recall
      condition (P < 0.10). These findings were strengthened by correlations between
      treatment-induced estradiol levels and changes in verbal memory performance. In
      addition, there was an association between estradiol levels and mood changes.
      However mood changes were not significantly associated with changes in verbal
      memory performance (P > 0.20). The present study supports the idea that estradiol
      replacement has specific effects on verbal memory in healthy postmenopausal
      women, with delayed recall being more affected. It suggests that these effects
      can occur relatively rapidly, and that there may be a dose response relationship 
      of estradiol to memory enhancement. Furthermore, the fact that these results were
      obtained in women who had been menopausal for an average of 17 years before
      entering the study indicates that the brain maintains a sensitivity for estrogens
      even after years of low estradiol plasma concentrations.

TI  - Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of 17 beta-estradiol after a single 4-day
      application of Oesclim 50, Oesclim 100, and Vivelle 0.05 (Menorest 50)
      transdermal delivery systems.
PG  - 811-6
AB  - Oesclim (Laboratoires Fournier, Dijon, France), also known as Esclim or Esclima, 
      is a new estradiol transdermal delivery system (TDS) developed for the treatment 
      of menopausal vasomotor symptoms. This open, randomized, three-way crossover
      study compared in 24 healthy postmenopausal women the pharmacokinetics of
      estradiol after a single 4-day application of Oesclim 50, Oesclim 100, and
      Vivelle 0.05 (CibaGeneva Pharmaceuticals, Summit, NJ; known as Menorest 50 in
      Europe, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer) on the upper buttock. Serum estradiol concentrations
      were determined by a validated radioimmunoassay method from samples taken before 
      and during each TDS application. The concentration-time profiles for Vivelle 0.05
      and Oesclim 50 were comparable with a similar absorption rate, giving a maximum
      concentration (Cmax) of 49 and 53 pg/mL above baseline, respectively, followed by
      a plateau throughout the 96-hour application period. At the end of this period,
      mean corrected estradiol concentrations were 18 and 19 pg/mL, respectively. The
      estradiol serum concentrations obtained after an application of Oesclim 100 were 
      approximately twice as high than with Oesclim 50. All products were well
      tolerated, but skin intolerance was more frequent with Vivelle 0.05 (4 patients; 
      four reports) and Oesclim 100 (3 patients; three reports) than with Oesclim 50
      (none). Problems of imperfect adhesion were more than five times as frequent with
      Vivelle 0.05 (44%) than with Oesclim (8%).

AB  - Local estrogen substitution has been shown to be more appropriate than any
      systemic application for the treatment of urogenital symptoms of hormone
      deficiency. The efficacy, safety and acceptability of a new low-dose drug
      delivery system consisting of an estradiol-releasing silicone vaginal ring was
      studied in two multicenter trials. In an open-label comparative trial a total of 
      219 postmenopausal women were randomized to the estradiol-releasing vaginal ring 
      or to estriol suppositories. In terms of efficacy both treatment arms were shown 
      to be equivalent; however, significantly higher rates of acceptability were found
      for the vaginal ring. In a double-blinded placebo-controlled study a total of 84 
      patients were randomized to either treatment arm for a period of 24 weeks. The
      statistically significant improvement of the vaginal epithelial pH and maturation
      values demonstrated the efficacy of the estradiol-releasing vaginal ring compared
      to the placebo ring.

PG  - 223-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Examining the consequences of temporary postoperative hormone
      replacement therapy following hysterectomy for the function of the ovaries and
      the subjective well-being of women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hormone profiles
      (Estradiol, FSH, LH, Testosterone, DHEA) and typical estradiol deficiency
      phenomena were investigated prospectively in premenopausal hysterectomized women 
      with intact ovaries. Group 1 (n = 21) was replaced transdermally following
      surgery for 3 weeks with estradiol patch 0.05 mg daily. Group 2 (n = 21) got no
      hormones. RESULTS: Group 1 had a remarkable decrease of estradiol after 10 days
      to 59% and after 6 weeks to 71% of the starting point. Gonadotropins showed an
      increase in this group. In group 2 without replacement there was only a small
      decrease of estradiol after 10 days and after 6 weeks the level was higher than
      before hysterectomy. Testosterone also decreased in group 1 to 64% of the level
      before surgery after 6 weeks, whereas in the comparing group it was 87%. On the
      other hand in group 1 only 2 of 21 women, but 10 of 21 in group 2 showed
      climacteric-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: HRT over 3 weeks induces ovarian
      suppression, which is still seen 6 weeks after hysterectomy. But hormonally
      treated women have clearly less subjective complaints.

TI  - Cognitive and neuroendocrine response to transdermal estrogen in postmenopausal
      women with Alzheimer's disease: results of a placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      pilot study.
PG  - 657-77
AB  - Preliminary evidence from clinical studies indicates that treatment with estrogen
      augments cognitive function for women with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
      neurobiology of estrogen, particularly its neuromodulatory and neuroprotective
      actions, provide a viable basis to support such cognition-enhancing effects. We
      conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group design pilot
      clinical study to evaluate the cognitive and neuroendocrine response to estrogen 
      administration for postmenopausal women with AD. Twelve women with probably AD of
      mild-moderate severity completed the study. During an eight week treatment
      period, six women received 0.05 mg/day dosage of 17 beta-estradiol via a skin
      patch and the remaining six wore a placebo skin patch. Subjects were randomized
      to equal distribution, and evaluated at baseline, at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8 on
      treatment, and at weeks 9, 10, 11, and 13 off treatment. On each day of
      evaluation, cognition was assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests,
      and blood samples were collected to measure plasma concentrations of estradiol
      and estrone. In addition, several neuroendocrine markers were measured in plasma 
      to evaluate the relationship between estrogen-induced cognitive effects and
      fluctuations in the catecholaminergic and insulin-like growth factor systems.
      Significant effects of estrogen treatment were observed on attention (i.e.
      Stroop: number of self-corrections in the Interference condition, F[1,8] = 8.22, 
      P < 0.03) and verbal memory (i.e., Buschke: delayed cued recall, F[3,30] = 4.31, 
      P < 0.02). The salutary effects of estrogen on cognition were observed after the 
      first week of treatment, and started to diminish when treatment was terminated.
      For women treated with estrogen, enhancement in verbal memory was positively
      correlated with plasma levels of estradiol (r = 0.96, P < 0.02) and negatively
      correlated with concentrations of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3
      (IGFBP-3) in plasma (r = -0.92, P < 0.03). Furthermore, a trend in the data was
      evident to suggest a negative relationship between plasma levels of insulin-like 
      growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and verbal memory (r = -0.86, P = 0.06). Estrogen
      administration suppressed peripheral markers of the IGF system, as evidenced by a
      negative correlation between plasma concentration of estradiol and IGF-1 (r =
      -0.93, P < 0.03), and a trend for a similar relationship between plasma levels of
      estradiol and IGFBP-3 (r = -0.86, P = 0.06). With respect to the catecholamines
      assayed, norepinephrine was positively correlated with verbal memory (r = 0.95, P
      < 0.02) for women who were treated with estrogen. Furthermore, there was a trend 
      to suggest a negative relationship between plasma epinephrine levels and the
      number of errors committed on a test of attention (r = -0.84, P = 0.07). In the
      placebo group, no significant effects of estrogen replacement were evident either
      on measures of cognition or on any of the neuroendocrine markers. The results of 
      this study suggest that estrogen replacement may enhance cognition for
      postmenopausal women with AD. Furthermore, several markers of neuroendocrine
      activity may serve to index the magnitude of estrogen-induced facilitation on
      cognition. In addition, research findings from the present study will provide
      important information for the design of larger prospective clinical studies that 
      are essential to definitively establish the therapeutic role of estrogen
      replacement for postmenopausal women with AD.

TI  - Biotransformation of oral dehydroepiandrosterone in elderly men: significant
      increase in circulating estrogens.
PG  - 2170-6
AB  - The most abundant human steroids, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate
      ester DHEAS, may have a multitude of beneficial effects, but decline with age.
      DHEA possibly prevents immunosenescence, and as a neuroactive steroid it may
      influence processes of cognition and memory. Epidemiological studies revealed an 
      inverse correlation between DHEAS levels and the incidence of cardiovascular
      disease in men, but not in women. To define a suitable dose for DHEA substitution
      in elderly men we studied pharmacokinetics and biotransformation of orally
      administered DHEA in 14 healthy male volunteers (mean age, 58.8 +/- 5.1 yr; mean 
      body mass index, 25.5 +/- 1.5 kg/m2) with serum DHEAS concentrations below 4.1
      micromol/L (1500 ng/mL). Diurnal blood sampling was performed on 3 occasions in a
      single dose, randomized, cross-over design (oral administration of placebo, 50 mg
      DHEA, or 100 mg DHEA). The intake of 50 mg DHEA led to an increase in serum DHEAS
      to mean levels of young adult men, whereas 100 mg DHEA induced supraphysiological
      concentrations [placebo vs. 50 mg DHEA vs. 100 mg DHEA; area under the curve
      (AUC) 0-12 h (mean +/- SD) for DHEA, 108 +/- 22 vs. 252 +/- 45 vs. 349 +/- 72
      nmol/L x h; AUC 0-12 h for DHEAS, 33 +/- 9 vs. 114 +/- 19 vs. 164 +/- 36
      micromol/L x h]. Serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone remained unchanged
      after DHEA administration. In contrast, 17beta-estradiol and estrone
      significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner to concentrations still within
      the upper normal range for men [placebo vs. 50 mg DHEA vs. 100 mg DHEA; AUC 0-12 
      h for 17beta-estradiol, 510 +/- 198 vs. 635 +/- 156 vs. 700 +/- 209 pmol/L x h (P
      < 0.0001); AUC 0-12 h for estrone, 1443 +/- 269 vs. 2537 +/- 434 vs. 3254 +/- 671
      pmol/L x h (P < 0.0001)]. In conclusion, 50 mg DHEA seems to be a suitable
      substitution dose in elderly men, as it leads to serum DHEAS concentrations
      usually measured in young healthy adults. The DHEA-induced increase in
      circulating estrogens may contribute to beneficial effects of DHEA in men.

TI  - Postmenopausal women without previous or current vasomotor symptoms do not flush 
      after abruptly abandoning estrogen replacement therapy.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most but not all women suffer from vasomotor symptoms around
      menopause. The exact mechanisms behind these symptoms are unknown, but the rate
      of decline in estrogen concentrations has been suggested to affect the risk of
      hot flushes. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess whether vasomotor symptoms
      were induced in women without previous such symptoms, when the women were given
      combined estradiol and progestagen therapy for 3 months, whereafter therapy was
      abruptly withdrawn. MATERIALS AND METHOD: After randomization, 40 postmenopausal 
      women without previous or current vasomotor symptoms were treated transdermally
      with either 50 micrograms/day 17 beta-estradiol or placebo during 14 weeks.
      During the 13th and 14th weeks, treatment was combined with oral
      medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day. Serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating
      hormone (FSH) concentrations were analysed before and after 12 weeks of therapy. 
      Climacteric symptoms were assessed at the same intervals as well as 8 weeks after
      the end of therapy. RESULTS: All women had low pretreatment levels of estradiol
      and high FSH concentrations. During estradiol therapy estradiol levels increased 
      significantly, whereas FSH only decreased slightly. No woman developed vasomotor 
      symptoms after withdrawal of therapy. CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal women without
      previous or current vasomotor symptoms did not develop such symptoms when
      estrogen replacement therapy was first instituted and then abruptly stopped.
      Probably other factors than the rate with which estrogen concentrations decrease 
      determine whether or not a woman will develop vasomotor symptoms. Evidently,
      estrogens can be prescribed to a woman who has no vasomotor symptoms, without
      much risk of inducing such symptoms if she decides to abandon therapy, even after
      3 months of treatment.

TI  - Premenstrual symptoms in women with premenstrual asthma.
PG  - 374-82
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To characterize and compare premenstrual symptoms (mood,
      physical) throughout two menstrual cycles with and without estradiol
      administration, in women with premenstrual asthma (PMA), and to examine
      relationships between asthma symptoms versus premenstrual symptoms and pulmonary 
      function versus premenstrual symptoms in these women. DESIGN: Open-label,
      longitudinal, 9-week study (consisting of two complete menstrual cycles).
      SETTING: Clinical study at the University of Kentucky; data analysis at the
      University of British Columbia and Children's and Women's Health Centre of
      British Columbia. PATIENTS: Fourteen women (age 35.6 +/- 6.6 yrs) with mild to
      moderate asthma with a baseline ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1
      second:forced vital capacity of 0.72 +/- 0.12. INTERVENTIONS: Women were followed
      for two complete menstrual cycles. During the second complete cycle (i.e., cycle 
      3), they received estradiol 2 mg orally between days 23 and 28 (premenstrual).
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Throughout both cycles 2 and 3, each subject
      recorded premenstrual symptom questionnaire scores (15 mood and physical
      symptoms, graded 0-3) every morning on awakening. Peak expiratory flow rate
      (PEFR) and visual analog scales of asthma symptoms (cough, wheezing,
      breathlessness, chest tightness) were recorded daily at the same time. Seven
      subjects showed a classic pattern of premenstrual symptoms. Four of the five
      subjects who complained of PMA symptoms at study enrollment also demonstrated
      this classic pattern of premenstrual symptoms. After estradiol administration,
      four women had lower symptom scores, eight had higher scores, and two had the
      same scores. Overall, estradiol had no significant effect on symptoms (mean area 
      under the curve 18.9 +/- 14.8 day(-1) vs 20.3 +/- 14.8 day(-1), p>0.05). Ten
      subjects had significant relationships between asthma symptoms and premenstrual
      symptoms, whereas six had significant relationships between PEFR and premenstrual
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous estradiol administration had no significant
      effect on premenstrual symptoms in women with PMA. The lack of a significant
      effect allows for patient blinding in a placebo-controlled, crossover study of
      exogenous estradiol in PMA that is currently under way Clinical implications of
      relationships between asthma symptoms versus premenstrual symptoms and pulmonary 
      function versus premenstrual symptoms may warrant further study.

TI  - HRT and Vit D in prevention of non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women; a
      5 year randomized trial.
PG  - 45-54
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated the incidence of new non-vertebral fractures during
      HRT or low-dose vitamin (Vit) D3 supplementation in a 5-year prospective trial.
      METHODS: A total of 464 early postmenopausal women, (a subgroup of the Kuopio
      Osteoporosis Study, n = 13,100) were randomized to four groups: (1) HRT, a
      sequential combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg cyproterone acetate;
      (2) Vit D (300 IU/day and 100 IU/day during the fifth years); (3) HRT + Vit D;
      and (4) placebo. Lumbar (L2-4) and femoral neck bone mineral densities (BMD) were
      determined by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline, after 2.5 and 5 years 
      of treatment. All new symptomatic non-vertebral, radiographically defined
      fractures were recorded. RESULTS: Altogether, 368 women (79%) completed the 5
      year treatment. In all, 32 women had 39 non-vertebral fractures during a mean of 
      4.3 year follow-up (HRT 4, Vit D 10, HRT + Vit D 8 and placebo 17). The reduction
      in the incidence of new non-vertebral fractures was significant in women with HRT
      alone (P = 0.032) when adjusted by baseline BMD and previous fractures; observed 
      also with the intention-to-treat principle (P = 0.048). When the HRT groups were 
      pooled, HRT showed a significantly lower incidence of new non-vertebral fractures
      (P = 0.042) than women receiving placebo and also after adjusting as above (P =
      0.016); both in valid-case and in the intention-to-treat analysis. In the Vit D
      group, the fracture incidence was non-significantly decreased (P = 0.229) in
      comparison with the placebo group. The estimated risk of new non-vertebral
      fractures among women treated with HRT alone was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.10-0.90) and
      with Vit D 0.47 (95% CI, 0.20-1.14) and with HRT + Vit D 0.44 (95% CI,
      0.17-1.15), in comparison with the placebo group (adjusted by femoral BMD and
      previous fractures). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first prospective trial
      confirming the beneficial effect of HRT on prevention of peripheral fractures in 
      non-osteoporotic postmenopausal women. The effect of low-dose Vit D remains to be
      proved.

TI  - Oral micronized progesterone.
PG  - 41-60; discussion 1-2
AB  - This review sought to examine the rationale for selecting an oral micronized
      progesterone formulation rather than a synthetic progestin for some of the main
      indications for progestogens. Unopposed estrogen use is associated with a high
      risk (relative risk, 2.1 to 5.7) of endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma,
      and it has been understood for some time that a progestogen must be added for at 
      least 10 to 14 days per month to prevent these effects. However, the most
      commonly used synthetic progestins, norethisterone and medroxyprogesterone
      acetate, have been associated with metabolic and vascular side effects (eg,
      suppression of the vasodilating effect of estrogens) in both experimental and
      human controlled studies. All comparative studies to date conclude that the side 
      effects of synthetic progestins can be minimized or eliminated through the use of
      natural progesterone, which is identical to the steroid produced by the corpus
      luteum. The inconvenience associated with the use of injectable, rectal, or
      vaginal formulations of natural progesterone can be circumvented by using orally 
      administered micronized progesterone. The bioavailability of micronized
      progesterone is similar to that of other natural steroids, and interindividual
      and intraindividual variability of area under the curve is similar to that seen
      with synthetic progestins. A clear dose-ranging effect has been demonstrated, and
      long-term protection of the endometrium has been established. Micronized
      progesterone has been used widely in Europe since 1980 at dosages ranging from
      300 mg/d (taken at bedtime) 10 days a month for women wishing regular monthly
      bleeding to 200 mg 14 days a month or 100 mg 25 days a month for women willing to
      remain amenorrheic. This therapy is well tolerated, with the only specific side
      effect being mild and transient drowsiness, an effect minimized by taking the
      drug at bedtime. The prospective, comparative Postmenopausal Estrogens/Progestin 
      Intervention trial has recommended oral micronized progesterone as the first
      choice for opposing estrogen therapy in nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women.

      tibolone 2.5 mg/day. METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, open-label study, 235
      postmenopausal women received one of the above-mentioned treatments. Fasting
      lipoproteins were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. At each visit,
      participants completed Greene climacteric questionnaires and recorded any
      bleeding episodes. Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation if normally 
      distributed, median and interquartile range if non-normally distributed, or as
      frequency count. For menopausal symptoms and diary card data, the differences
      were tested by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen women
      received continuous combined HRT and 119 women received tibolone; 72 and 76
      women, respectively, completed 12 months of therapy. Both treatments effectively 
      relieved vasomotor symptoms and reduced serum total cholesterol. Continuous
      combined HRT, but not tibolone, significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein
      levels. Both treatments reduced high-density lipoprotein levels, but the effect
      was more profound with tibolone. The initial bleeding score was higher for women 
      taking continuous combined HRT; however, by the end of the study, the percentages
      of amenorrheal women were comparable. Endometrial histology was similar for both 
      treatments at the end of the study, although two cases of proliferative
      endometrium were found in the tibolone group. CONCLUSION: Estradiol
      valerate-norethisterone continuous combined HRT controls symptoms and is
      associated with a safe lipid profile.

PG  - 847-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of esterified estrogens alone and combined
      with oral androgen on sexual function and menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal
      women. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty postmenopausal women dissatisfied with their estrogen
      or estrogen-progestin therapy volunteered to enter a double-blind, randomized
      trial in which they received either oral esterified estrogens or esterified
      estrogens + androgen for eight weeks after a single-blind, placebo, lead-in
      period. Sexual function was assessed with a questionnaire used in the Yale
      midlife survey, and plasma levels of estradiol, estrone, sex hormone binding
      globulin (SHBG) and beta-endorphin were measured at two- to four-week intervals. 
      RESULTS: Estrogen-androgen therapy significantly improved sexual sensation and
      desire after four and eight weeks of double-blind treatment in comparison to
      previous estrogen therapy and postplacebo baseline assessments. Plasma levels of 
      estradiol and estrone increased significantly in all patients as compared to the 
      postplacebo baseline and decreased in comparison to circulating estrogen
      concentrations on previous therapy. Relative proportions of free and bound
      steroid hormone exhibited contrasting shifts during estrogen and
      estrogen-androgen therapy. SHBG increased in the estrogen group and decreased in 
      the estrogen-androgen group, leading to lower amounts of free androgens during
      estrogen therapy and increased free androgen levels during estrogen-androgen
      therapy. Since proportions of free (bioavailable) ovarian steroids would
      correlate inversely with plasma protein binding capacity, the beneficial effects 
      of oral estrogen-androgen therapy on sexual sensation and desire may be due
      either to the administered androgen or to the increased availability of
      endogenous and exogenous androgens, particularly in the central nervous system.
      CONCLUSION: Sexual desire, satisfaction and frequency in postmenopausal women
      taking hormonal therapy were improved significantly by combined estrogen-androgen
      therapy but not by estrogen or estrogen-progestin therapy. Sexual function
      improved with estrogen-androgen therapy even though circulating estrogen levels
      were lower than those measured during previous estrogen therapy. This leads to
      the conclusion that androgens play a pivotal role in sexual function but that
      estrogens are not a significant factor determining levels of sexual drive and
      enjoyment.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether psychological support
      associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was more beneficial than
      replacement therapy alone. Our findings showed that HRT alone was more effective 
      against vasomotor symptoms than HRT with psychological treatment (PT). While the 
      combination of both treatment modalities (HRT + PT) was more effective against
      insomnia, nervousness, melancholy, fatigue, palpitations, and vertigo. Hormonal
      treatment alone and HRT with psychological treatment had little effect against
      paresthesia or tingling. Neither HRT alone nor HRT with psychological treatment
      was effective against joint and muscle pain or headache.

TI  - Acute estradiol and progesterone administration reduced cardiovascular and
      catecholamine responses to mental stress in menopausal women.
PG  - 269-74
AB  - Steroid hormones are involved in the regulation of sympathoadrenal activity.
      Since the effect of sex steroids on the cardiovascular system and catecholamine
      secretion could also be exerted through an acute, nongenomic mechanism, we have
      studied the response to mental stress (color word test, CWT) in a group of 15
      menopausal women during estrogen (100 microg of estradiol by patch), progesterone
      (100 mg i.m.) or placebo administration. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased 
      during CWT in the three sessions (F = 11.0, p < 0.001) but the area under the
      curve of SBP was higher during placebo (2,855 +/- 131 mm Hg x min) than during
      estradiol (2,585 +/- 139 mm Hg x min) and progesterone (2,553 +/- 179 mm Hg x
      min, p < 0.05 for both). Plasma epinephrine increased during CWT in the three
      sessions (F = 31.1, p < 0.001) and the plasma epinephrine response to mental
      stress was higher during placebo than during estradiol administration (F = 4.3, p
      < 0.01). The area under the curve of epinephrine was 10,342 +/- 1,348 pmol/min x 
      1 during placebo and 7,280 +/- 818 pmol/min x 1 during estradiol (p < 0.03). The 
      plasma glycerol levels at the end of CWT were higher during placebo (0.26 +/-
      0.04 nmol/l) than during estradiol (0.19 +/- 0.03 mmol/l) and progesterone (0.17 
      +/- 0.04 mmol/l) administration (p < 0.05 for both). No significant differences
      were found in the responses of diastolic blood pressure, heart rate,
      norepinephrine and cortisol to mental stress during placebo and estradiol or
      progesterone administration. This study demonstrates that acute steroid
      administration is able to modify the cardiovascular and catecholamine response to
      mental stress in menopausal women.

TI  - Neuroendocrine effects of different estradiol-progestin regimens in
      postmenopausal women.
PG  - 127-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: New regimens and routes of administration of hormonal replacement
      therapy (HRT) in climateric women are becoming available. Since there is no
      information on the neuroendocrine effects of sequential combined treatment with
      17 beta-estradiol and a progestin, the present study evaluated the
      neuroendocrine, clinical vasomotor and psychological changes before and after
      different sequential combined HRT regimens (17 beta-estradiol plus nomegestrol
      acetate, or cyproterone acetate, or vaginal progesterone). Vasomotor and
      behavioral effects were evaluated by using the Kupperman score, while changes in 
      plasma endorphin (beta-END) levels were used as marker of neuroendocrine effects.
      METHODS: Postmenopausal women (n = 30) were randomly divided into three groups
      (ten women for each group); all women received continuous 17 beta-estradiol (50
      mg, transdermal) and each group was sequentially treated with different
      progestins for 12 days/month: group A, cyproterone acetate (5 mg p.o.); group B, 
      nomegestrol acetate (5 mg p.o.); and group C, progesterone (100 mg, vaginal
      cream). A group of healthy fertile women (n = 8) served as control. Before and
      after 6 months of HRT, postmenopausal women underwent an evaluation of subjective
      Kupperman score and two neuroendocrine tests: (a) naloxone (4 mg i.v.) and (b)
      clonidine (1.25 mg i.v.). Plasma beta-END levels were measured before and at 15, 
      30, 45, 60 and 90 min after drug injection. Control women were studied by
      administering the two neuroendocrine tests only once. RESULTS: Postmenopausal
      women before HRT showed a pathological Kupperman and no changes of plasma
      beta-END levels in response to the clonidine and naloxone tests score. On the
      contrary the increase was significant in healthy women. In each of the three
      groups of treated women both naloxone and clonidine tests induced a significant
      increase in plasma beta-END levels (P < 0.01). After 6 months of HRT, an
      improvement of vasomotor and psychological symptoms was shown by a decrease of
      Kupperman score. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that sequential
      treatment with transdermal 17 beta-estradiol and progestin, no matter which
      progestin was used, restores the beta-END release, improves vasomotor and
      psychological symptoms.

TI  - Safety surveillance of esterified estrogens-methyltestosterone (Estratest and
      Estratest HS) replacement therapy in the United States.
PG  - 1070-84
AB  - This paper summarizes all postmarketing safety surveillance data collected by
      Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Marietta, Georgia), between 1989 and 1996 for
      Estratest and Estratest HS (half-strength). These oral esterified
      estrogens--methyltestosterone combination products have been marketed in the
      United States since 1964 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor
      symptoms associated with menopause in patients whose symptoms have not been
      relieved by estrogens alone. Between 1989 and 1996, more than 1 million
      woman-years of exposure occurred. The safety profile contained in this paper is
      based on a cumulative total of 568 individual cases comprising 863 adverse events
      (AEs). The proportions of AEs associated with the use of Estratest (575 events;
      66.6%) and Estratest HS (288 events; 33.4%) were commensurate with the
      proportions of individual reports of adverse experiences for the two formulations
      (369 reports [65.0%] and 199 reports [35.0%], respectively). The rank order and
      percentage of types of AEs reported were also similar. The cumulative volume of
      reports was relatively low given the extent of exposure. Despite the limitations 
      inherent in spontaneous postmarketing surveillance, the safety profile derived
      from this assessment does not indicate a significant safety concern with
      Estratest or Estratest HS. No deaths were reported, and no adverse findings
      indicative of the need for more comprehensive surveillance or concern on the part
      of the medical community or consumers were observed. Reports of cancer,
      cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic phenomena, and hepatic dysfunction were
      few and were assessed as not related to treatment with Estratest or Estratest HS;
      reports of drug overdose, drug-drug interaction, and birth defects were rare (4
      of 863 events; 0.5%). The most commonly reported AEs were those known to be
      associated with estrogen therapy (weight gain, headache, nausea, and
      vasodilatation) and androgen treatment (alopecia, acne, and hirsutism).
      Twenty-three (4.0%) of the 568 cases reported had at least one event that was
      regarded as serious, and 53 (6.1%) of the total 863 AEs were regarded as serious.
      The findings indicate that Estratest and Estratest HS are safe when used as
      directed and that the marginal increase in risk associated with androgen
      coadministration can be managed with appropriate patient selection and
      monitoring, as stated in the package insert for these compounds.

TI  - Estrogen-androgen for hormone replacement. A review.
PG  - 394-404
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To critically examine the role of androgens as part of postmenopausal 
      hormone replacement therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Examination of original reports and
      reviews obtained by electronic database searches and supplemented by manual
      search of bibliographies. RESULTS: As compared to estrogens alone,
      estrogen-androgen therapy may better protect against osteoporosis and increase
      libido, energy levels and general sense of well-being. However, estrogen-androgen
      replacement also reduces the beneficial increases in high-density lipoprotein
      induced by estrogens alone, although this effect may be offset at least partially
      by decreases in atherogenic triglycerides. The long-term net effect of
      estrogen-androgen replacement on cardiovascular disease remains unknown.
      CONCLUSION: Although the literature includes relatively few clinical trials or
      well-controlled studies and is further limited by the subjective nature of
      outcomes, such as sexual and psychological function, the available data suggest
      that for many postmenopausal women, estrogen-androgen replacement may provide
      benefits beyond those provided by estrogen-only replacement therapy.

AB  - The endocrine physiology of the climacteric supports a rationale for the
      concomitant replacement of androgen and estrogen following menopause. Clinical
      and research experience with estrogen-androgen hormone replacement therapy, as
      well as androgen-only therapy, suggests that the health benefit offered by
      androgen replacement exceeds the potential risk when treatment is properly
      managed. In this review, we concentrate on the effects of oral alkylated
      androgens. The virilizing effects (e.g., hirsutism, acne, voice change, and
      alopecia) of oral androgens are typically dose and duration dependent; androgen
      replacement at doses < or = 10 mg once daily administered for prolonged periods
      (> 6 months) produces masculinization effects that generally abate with dose
      reduction or discontinuation of treatment. No clinical sequelae or irreversible
      pathophysiologic effects have been associated with any virilization that may
      occur. Changes in lipoprotein metabolism associated with oral estrogen-androgen
      use include reduced total cholesterol levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol levels which may reduce the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease.
      No clinically identifiable risk with respect to other cardiovascular variables,
      such as blood pressure, has been associated with the longterm administration of
      low doses of oral androgen. With regard to liver toxicity, reports of jaundice,
      peliosis hepatis, and hepatocellular carcinoma are extremely rare at the dose
      levels of androgen used in hormone replacement therapy, although individual
      sensitivity to the potential hepatotoxic effects of oral alkylated and
      nonalkylated androgen may vary considerably. Daily dosing with oral alkylated
      androgen in combination with estrogen is well tolerated. Retrospective and
      prospective studies involving the use of androgens alone and in combination with 
      estrogens demonstrate that concerns about the adverse effects of androgen use
      associated with supraphysiologic, self-escalated doses in men do not apply to the
      much lower doses combined with estrogens for hormone replacement in
      postmenopausal women.

TI  - Vaginal ultrasound of the endometrium in postmenopausal women with symptoms of
      urogenital atrophy on low-dose estrogen or tibolone treatment: a comparison.
PG  - 57-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of locally
      administered low-dose estrogens (0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens) and orally
      administered tibolone in postmenopausal women with symptoms and signs of atrophic
      vaginitis. Vaginal ultrasound was performed for the evaluation of endometrial or 
      ovarian abnormalities. METHODS: A 6-month comparative randomised prospective
      study of women taking tibolone and locally administered low-dose estrogens.
      Seventy two postmenopausal women with symptoms of atrophic vaginitis were
      examined with vaginal ultrasound. The endometrial thickness, the endometrial
      volume, the uterus and the ovaries were measured before and after 6 months of
      treatment with low-dose estrogens or tibolone. RESULTS: In group A (low-dose
      estrogens treatment) the mean endometrial thickness, before and after treatment, 
      was 3.0 +/- 0.1 mm and 2.9 +/- 0.8 mm, respectively. The mean ovarian volume was 
      3.9 ml. There were no changes in uterine volume during the treatment period. In
      group B (treated with tibolone) endometrial thickness was 3.2 +/- 0.3 mm and 3.2 
      +/- 0.7 mm, respectively. One women experienced vaginal bleeding. The volume of
      corpus uteri was unchanged after treatment. The volume of both ovaries was 4.2 ml
      and 3.9 ml, respectively. The overall acceptability of both types of
      administration was good. CONCLUSIONS: This study, using vaginal ultrasound, has
      shown that either hormone replacement therapy with tibolone or symptomatic
      treatment with low-dose estrogens, gives no sign of endometrial proliferation
      measured as endometrial thickness.

TI  - Effect on sexual life--a comparison between tibolone and a continuous
      estradiol-norethisterone acetate regimen.
PG  - 15-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to compare the effects of tibolone 2.5 mg (Livial) with those of 17
      beta-estradiol 2 mg plus norethisterone acetate 1 mg (Kliogest) on sexual life.
      METHODS: in a 48 week, double blind, multicenter study, 437 postmenopausal women 
      were randomised to treatment with either tibolone or 17 beta-estradiol 2 mg plus 
      norethisterone acetate. Treatment groups were compared with respect to different 
      aspects of sexual life with a questionnaire covering sexual experience and
      responsiveness during the last 30 days. RESULTS: a total of 315 subjects
      completed 48 weeks treatment. In the E2/NETA group an improvement after 48 weeks 
      compared to baseline was observed in five out of seven items assessing sexual
      life. In the tibolone group an improvement regarding all seven items assessing
      sexual life was seen. When tibolone was compared to E2/NETA significantly higher 
      scores were found for the items assessing 'frequency', 'satisfaction' and
      'enjoyment'. CONCLUSIONS: this study indicate that tibolone and E2/NETA -which
      both have an androgenic profile-affect several aspects of sexual life positively.
      The difference with respect to satisfaction with sexual enjoyment and frequency
      could be of clinical importance.

TI  - Comparison of two estradiol transdermal systems (Oesclim 50 and Estraderm TTS
      50). I. Tolerability, adhesion and efficacy.
PG  - 161-73
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to compare the tolerability, adhesion and
      efficacy of a new matrix-type estradiol transdermal system, Oesclim 50, with
      those of Estraderm TTS 50, a reservoir-type system. METHODS: This was an open,
      randomised, parallel-group, multi-centre clinical trial, performed in six
      European countries. A total of 143 healthy menopausal women were allocated to
      treatment with Oesclim 50 and 140 to Estraderm TTS 50. The transdermal systems
      were applied twice weekly for 24 days out of each 28-day cycle, over a period of 
      four cycles. Oral progestogen treatment was taken by non-hysterectomised patients
      for the last 12 days of estrogen therapy in each cycle. RESULTS: The local skin
      tolerability of the Oesclim 50 transdermal system was significantly better than
      that of Estraderm TTS 50. In the Oesclim 50 group, 4.2% of applications caused a 
      reaction, compared with 9.5% in the Estraderm TTS 50 group (P < 0.001). Safety
      assessments showed both treatments to be well tolerated. Seven patients in the
      Oesclim 50 group, and 12 in the Estraderm TTS 50 group, discontinued due to
      adverse events. Of these discontinuations, one (0.7% of patients) in the Oesclim 
      50 group and seven (5.1% of patients) in the Estraderm TTS 50 group were due to
      application site reactions (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant
      difference between the two groups in the percentage of patients with signs of
      hyperestrogenism (29 patients (20.3%) in the Oesclim group and 28 patients
      (20.0%) in the Estraderm TTS 50 group). Adhesion was significantly better for the
      Oesclim 50 transdermal system, with 6.0% of Oesclim 50 applications becoming
      detached compared with 11.3% of Estraderm TTS 50 applications (P < 0.001). The
      greater adhesion of Oesclim 50 was particularly apparent when the systems were
      exposed to water, with three times fewer Oesclim 50 systems becoming detached
      during a shower or bath (P < 0.001 in each case). Both treatments produced
      significant and comparable improvements in vasomotor symptoms, other menopausal
      symptoms and gynaecological assessments. A near-maximal effect on vasomotor
      symptoms was observed after approximately 1 month of treatment, and was
      maintained for the entire treatment period. CONCLUSION: Overall, Oesclim 50
      provided statistically significantly better local skin tolerability and adhesion 
      than Estraderm TTS 50, together with comparable efficacy and safety.

TI  - Luteal support after in-vitro fertilization: Crinone 8%, a sustained release
      vaginal progesterone gel, versus Utrogestan, an oral micronized progesterone.
PG  - 2085-9
AB  - Two progesterone presentations, a vaginal application of 90 mg progesterone per
      day (Crinone) or 300 mg progesterone administered orally (Utrogestan), were
      compared for luteal phase support of patients undergoing an in-vitro
      fertilization (IVF) procedure. A total of 283 patients were randomly allocated to
      either treatment. The treatment started within 24 h after the embryo transfer
      procedure and continued until day 30 in cases of implantation. Efficacy was
      assessed using the pregnancy and delivery rates. Safety was assessed through
      specific symptoms and usual safety monitoring. The pregnancy rates per transfer
      were not significantly different in the Crinone and Utrogestan groups at days 12 
      (Crinone 35.3%, Utrogestan 29.9%, P = 0.55), 30 (Crinone 28.5%, Utrogestan 25.0%,
      P = 0.61) and 90 (Crinone 25.9%, Utrogestan 22.9%, P = 0.69). No differences in
      the spontaneous abortion rates were seen thereafter. The delivery rates (number
      of deliveries per patient; Crinone 23.0%, Utrogestan 22.2%, P = 1.00), as well as
      the ratio of newborn babies per embryo transferred (Crinone 11.7%, Utrogestan
      11.1%, P = 0.91), were not significantly different. Safety parameters were
      similar in both groups, except for drowsiness, which was more significantly
      frequent in the oral progesterone group than in the Crinone group at all time
      points. No serious adverse events were recorded in this study. The fact that
      Crinone matches the efficacy of the larger doses of progesterone used orally
      reflects an advantage of the transvaginal route of administration which avoids
      the metabolic inactivation of progesterone during its first liver pass.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, multicentre study comparing the clinical effects of
      two sequential estradiol-progestin combinations containing either desogestrel or 
      norethisterone acetate in climacteric women with estrogen deficiency symptoms.
PG  - 111-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare a new estradiol-desogestrel
      (E2-DG) regimen with an E2-norethisterone acetate (NETA) combination (Trisekvens)
      regarding the treatment of menopausal complaints, bleeding pattern, histology of 
      the endometrium and the occurrence of adverse experiences. METHODS: A total of
      310 peri-/postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms were randomly allocated 
      to oral sequential treatment with either the E2-DG combination (1.5 mg E2 for 24 
      days with 0.15 mg DG for the last 12 days followed by 1 placebo tablet for 4
      days) or with the E2-NETA combination (Trisekvens, 2 mg E2 for 22 days with 1 mg 
      NETA for the last 10 days followed by 1 mg E2 for 6 days). Treatments were
      administered double-blind for 12 cycles of 28 days. RESULTS: One hundred and four
      women, 48 in the E2-DG group and 56 in the E2-NETA group, discontinued the study 
      due to bleeding irregularities and various adverse effects. Both treatments
      reduced menopausal symptoms and complaints effectively and almost equally. The
      alleviation of perspirations and the improvement of general fitness were more
      apparent (P = 0.009) during cycle 1 with the E2-NETA treatment but were greater
      (P < 0.02) during the last 9/10-12 cycles of E2-DG treatment compared to E2-NETA.
      Regular withdrawal bleeding appeared in 93% and 90% of the women during treatment
      with E2-DG and E2-NETA, respectively. Intermenstrual bleeding occurred in 8% of
      women receiving E2-DG and in 13% of women treated with E2-NETA. The corresponding
      figures for intermenstrual bleeding-spotting were 21% and 22%. Secretory
      endometrium was detected in 65% and 54% of the samples taken at the end of
      treatment with E2-DG and E2-NETA, respectively. No hyperplasia or atypia was
      found. No serious adverse events related to treatment occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Both
      regimens alleviated effectively menopausal complaints and did not induce
      hyperplasia of endometrium. The minor differences recorded between the two
      regimens were probably due to the differences in their composition concerning the
      amount of estradiol and its distribution along the cycle, the amount and type of 
      progestin and the length of estradiol/progestin combination phase.

TI  - Replens versus dienoestrol cream in the symptomatic treatment of vaginal atrophy 
      in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 259-63
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of Replens, a
      non-hormonal moisturizing vaginal gel, on symptoms of vaginal atrophy in
      postmenopausal women, in comparison with Dienoestrol (Cilag), an oestrogenic
      vaginal cream. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients were randomly allocated to either of
      the two treatments. Replens was given three times a week during the 12 weeks of
      the study, while Dienoestrol was administered daily during the first 2 weeks and 
      thereafter three times a week. Vaginal dryness index, itching, irritation,
      dyspareunia, pH and safety were evaluated every week the first month and every
      month thereafter. RESULTS: Both treatments had a significant increase on vaginal 
      dryness index as soon as the first week of treatment, and the hormonal compound
      was significantly better than the non-hormonal one. All symptoms such as itching,
      irritation and dyspareunia significantly decreased or disappeared without any
      difference between the two treatments. For pH, no significant difference was seen
      either in each group or between the two groups. No adverse events related with
      the two drugs were found. CONCLUSION: This study shows that Replens applied
      vaginally three times a week, is a full therapy for all symptoms of vaginal
      atrophy as well as local estrogen. No serious adverse event was related. Replens 
      is an alternative treatment to local estrogen and perhaps a good complement of
      systemic HRT in patient suffering from vaginal dryness.

      replacement therapy in women with hysterectomy. Medical Research Council's
      General Practice Research Framework.
PG  - 473-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the acceptability and symptomatic and metabolic effects of 
      two regimens of hormone replacement therapy in women with hysterectomy. DESIGN:
      Randomised, double blind comparison. SETTING: Seven group practices in the
      Medical Research Council's general practice research framework. SUBJECTS: 321
      women with hysterectomy aged 35-59. INTERVENTIONS: Hormone replacement therapy
      with (a) conjugated equine oestrogen 625 micrograms daily alone or (b) conjugated
      equine oestrogen 625 micrograms daily plus the progestogen norgestrel 150
      micrograms daily for the last 12 days of the 'cycle.' MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Changes in blood pressure, weight, symptoms, and haemostatic and lipid values.
      RESULTS: After two years 36% (57/158) of women randomly allocated to take
      oestrogen alone had discontinued treatment as compared with 30% (49/163) of women
      allocated to take oestrogen plus progestogen. Smokers were more likely to
      withdraw than non-smokers. There were no clear differences between the two groups
      in symptoms often attributed to hormone replacement therapy or in blood pressure 
      or weight. At one year low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations had
      fallen substantially in both groups. High density lipoprotein cholesterol
      concentrations rose to significantly higher values in women taking oestrogen
      alone compared with those taking oestrogen plus progestogen, though triglyceride 
      concentrations and factor VII activity were also significantly higher in this
      group. Fibrinogen concentration tended to fall, though not significantly, in both
      groups, possibly more in women taking oestrogen alone. CONCLUSIONS: Oestrogen
      plus progestogen was no less well tolerated than oestrogen alone. There was a
      fairly even balance between possibly beneficial and adverse effects of the two
      regimens on lipid concentrations and coagulability. Concern that the combined
      regiment may not have the cardioprotective effects ascribed to oestrogen alone
      can to some extent be allayed, with reassurance for the growing numbers of women 
      with intact uteri using the combined regiment. Misgivings about the combined
      regiment in women with hysterectomy on the grounds of its acceptability and its
      effects on lipid values may also be unfounded.

      women. The Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) Trial. The
      Writing Group for the PEPI Trial.
PG  - 370-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the histological findings of the endometrium of
      postmenopausal women who were randomized to receive placebo, estrogen only, or
      one of three estrogen plus progestin (E+P) regimens in the Postmenopausal
      Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) Trial. DESIGN: A 3-year multicenter,
      randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 596
      postmenopausal women aged 45 through 64 years without contraindication to hormone
      therapy. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized and stratified in equal
      numbers to one of the following treatments in 28-day cycles: placebo, 0.625 mg/d 
      of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg/d of CEE plus 10 mg/d of
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for the first 12 days, 0.625 mg/d of CEE plus
      2.5 mg/d of MPA, or 0.625 mg/d of CEE plus 200 mg/d of micronized progesterone
      (MP) for the first 12 days. OUTCOME MEASURE: Histology of endometrium collected
      at baseline, annual, or unscheduled visits by biopsy, curettage, or hysterectomy.
      ANALYSIS: Intention to treat. RESULTS: During follow-up women assigned to
      estrogen alone were more likely to develop simple (cystic), complex
      (adenomatous), or atypical hyperplasia than those given placebo (27.7% vs 0.8%,
      22.7% vs 0.8%, and 11.8% vs 0%, respectively) for the same types of hyperplasia
      (P < .001). Participants administered one of the three E+P regimens had similar
      rates of hyperplasia as those given placebo (P = .16). The occurrence of
      hyperplasia was distributed evenly across the 3 years of the trial. Women taking 
      estrogens alone also had more unscheduled biopsies (66.4% vs 8.4%; P < .001) and 
      curettages (17.6% vs 0.8%; P < .001) than women receiving placebo. The number of 
      surgical procedures was similar for women receiving placebo and women receiving
      the E+P regimens (P = .38). Of the 45 women with complex (adenomatous) or
      atypical hyperplasia, study medications were discontinued in all, and the biopsy 
      results of 34 (94%) of 36 women with hyperplasia reverted to normal with
      progestin therapy. The remainder had dilatation and curettage (n = 2) or
      hysterectomy with (n = 2) or without (n = 6) prior medical therapy, or refused
      further biopsies (n = 1). One woman developed adenocarcinoma of the endometrium
      while receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS: At a dosage of 0.625 mg, the daily
      administration of CEE enhanced the development of endometrial hyperplasia.
      Combining CEE with cyclic or continuous MPA or cyclic MP protected the
      endometrium from hyperplastic changes associated with estrogen-only therapy.

      hormone replacement therapy.
PG  - 31-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate low doses of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and norethisterone
      acetate (NETA) as continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in their 
      effects on vasomotor symptoms, bleeding episodes, endometrial histology and
      mastalgia. METHOD: Sixty postmenopausal women were randomly allocated to three
      treatment groups and were given 1 mg E2 and 0.25 mg NETA (A), 1 mg E2 and 0.5 mg 
      NETA (B) and 2 mg E2 and 1.0 mg NETA (C) in daily doses. The treatment period was
      1 year. RESULTS: A similar statistically significant reduction of climacteric
      symptoms (P < 0.05) was found in all groups. Bleedings, mainly as spottings,
      occurred most commonly during the first treatment months. Fewer bleeding episodes
      and a higher percentage of amenorrhea was noted in group B compared to the other 
      groups but did not reach statistical significance. All endometrial biopsies
      showed atrophy. Women in group A and B had less severe mastalgia (P < 0.05)
      compared to group C, given higher doses of steroids. CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal
      women taking 1 mg of E2 plus 0.5 mg NETA as continuous combined HRT reported a
      marked reduction of climacteric complaints and good bleeding control. No
      endometrial proliferation was detected after 1 year of treatment. This type of
      therapy may be beneficial especially for elderly women, in whom bleeding may be
      annoying.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of estrogen alone and estrogen plus androgen on
      biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 37-43
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine whether the addition of an androgen
      to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women would alter the skeletal response as 
      determined by measurements of markers of bone formation and resorption.
      Postmenopausal women were treated for 9 weeks with either a combination of 1.25
      mg esterified estrogen and 2.5 mg methyltestosterone (E+A) or 1.25 mg conjugated 
      equine estrogen (CEE). Both groups showed a similar decrease in urinary excretion
      of the bone resorption markers, deoxypyridinoline, pyridinoline, and
      hydroxyproline. Patients treated with CEE showed decreases in the serum markers
      of bone formation, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and
      C-terminal procollagen peptide. In contrast, subjects treated with E+A showed
      increases in these markers of bone formation. CEE increased, and E+A decreased
      serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin as well as triglycerides and high
      density lipoprotein levels. Only CEE significantly reduced low density
      lipoproteins. Both regimens were effective in reducing postmenopausal somatic
      symptoms, but only E+A had a significant effect on psychological symptoms. We
      conclude that short term administration of androgen with estrogen may reverse the
      inhibitory effects of estrogen on bone formation. Long term studies are needed to
      determine the relative benefits and risks of the combination of estrogen and
      androgen and whether this results in greater increases in bone mass and strength.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled, hormonal, syndromal and EEG mapping studies
      with transdermal oestradiol therapy in menopausal depression.
PG  - 321-9
AB  - In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the antidepressant and
      vigilance-promoting properties of transdermal oestrogen in post-menopausal
      depression were investigated utilizing hormonal, syndromal and EEG mapping
      evaluations. Sixty-nine menopausal women, aged 45-60 years without previous
      hormonal replacement therapy, diagnosed as major depression without psychotic or 
      suicidal symptoms (DSM-III-R criteria), were randomly assigned to a 3-month
      treatment with transdermal oestradiol [Estraderm TTS (ETTS) 50 micrograms,
      applied twice weekly] or placebo. No other psychoactive medication was allowed.
      After removal of protocol violators, 32 patients were evaluable in each group,
      which did not differ in age, height or weight. As five patients discontinued
      prematurely in both groups and in one placebo patient a post-drug EEG could not
      be obtained, 27 patients remained in the ETTS and 26 in the placebo group for
      efficacy analysis. While in the placebo group, oestradiol (E2) and follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) remained unchanged, E2 increased and FSH decreased
      significantly in the ETTS group. Syndromal evaluation showed a significant
      improvement in the Kupperman Index (KI) as well as Hamilton Depression Rating
      Scale (HAMD) in both groups, with no inter-group difference. However, EEG mapping
      demonstrated significant inter-drug differences in brain function, mostly over
      the left temporal region. While ETTS patients showed an increase of alpha and
      alpha-adjacent theta activity and a decrease of beta activity, as well as an
      acceleration of the delta/theta centroid and a slowing of the alpha, beta and
      total power centroid, no changes occurred in the placebo-treated patients. These 
      neurophysiological findings suggest improvement of vigilance by oestrogen,
      previously referred to as "mental tonic" effect. There were no changes, however, 
      in the frontal alpha asymmetry index, reflecting left frontal hypo- and right
      frontal hyperactivation. Thus, this neurophysiological variable represents a
      state-independent marker for depression. The tolerability of ETTS was very good.

      respectively) were considered in the intent-to-treat population and 204 (102 in
      each group) in the safety population. The two treatment groups were comparable
      with regard to the demographic data and menopausal status. The primary efficacy
      criteria were the comparison between Menorest 50 and the reservoir transdermal
      patch in erythema and pruritus at application sites and the difference between
      the treatment groups in the mean number of hot flushes per day at week 12,
      adjusted for baseline. A statistically significant reduction in the mean number
      of hot flushes was observed in each group compared with baseline, with a decrease
      from 6.5 at baseline to 0.3 at 12 weeks and 6.4 to 0.4 in the Menorest 50 and
      reservoir transdermal patch groups respectively; there was no statistically
      significant difference between the two groups during the 12-week treatment. The
      severity score of menopausal symptoms was also dramatically improved in each of
      the two treatment groups. There were no statistically significant differences in 
      the mean plasma estradiol concentrations and mean estradiol to estrone ratio (>
      1.0) in both groups after 10 weeks of therapy. A similar number of adverse events
      was observed in both groups. Menorest 50 showed better local tolerability than
      the reservoir transdermal patch with a lower incidence of topical adverse events,
      erythema and pruritus. In summary, Menorest 50 was as effective as the reservoir 
      transdermal patch in reducing the mean number of hot flushes, and improving the
      severity of other menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor, psychiatric and
      urogenital symptoms.

TI  - Efficacy of oral micronized progesterone in the treatment of luteal phase
      defects.
PG  - 521-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vaginal progesterone suppositories are an accepted treatment for
      infertility attributed to luteal phase defects. Although oral micronized
      progesterone may be preferable to suppositories for many patients, there are no
      studies on its use for patients with luteal phase defects. This study evaluated
      the efficacy of oral micronized progesterone for the treatment of luteal phase
      defects. STUDY DESIGN: Seven women with luteal phase defects previously corrected
      by vaginal suppositories were administered oral micronized progesterone (200 mg
      by mouth three times a day). Endometrial biopsies were performed to evaluate
      treatment efficacy. Questionnaires were used to assess side effects, including
      sedation. RESULTS: On oral micronized progesterone, all patients had in-phase
      endometrial biopsies. Despite complaints of drowsiness, the majority of patients 
      preferred the oral formulation over the vaginal route of administration.
      CONCLUSION: We conclude that oral micronized progesterone is efficacious in the
      treatment of luteal phase defects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of tibolone on endometrial safety, plasma
      estradiol concentrations, lipid metabolism and climacteric symptoms in comparison
      to sequential conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate in
      postmenopausal women. METHODS: In a randomised, open-label, 6-cycle,
      group-comparative study, the effects on the aforementioned parameters were
      studied with tibolone 2.5 mg/day (N = 13) continuously, and with conjugated
      equine estrogens 0.625 mg/day continuously, combined with medroxyprogesterone
      acetate 5 mg/day (N = 11) (CEE/MPA) sequentially, during 12 days of each 28-day
      cycle. Within-group statistical analysis was performed with Student's t-test for 
      paired samples, whereas between-group statistics were performed using the
      Student's t-test for independent groups. RESULTS: Cytological evaluation revealed
      no endometrial stimulation in either group. In the tibolone group, there were no 
      effects on estradiol levels, whereas in the CEE/MPA group, an increase in total
      and non-SHBG-bound estradiol plasma levels was reported. In the tibolone group,
      there were significant decreases in plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides,
      HDL-cholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol, whereas no significant changes in
      LDL-cholesterol and IDL-cholesterol were reported. In the CEE/MPA group there
      were significant decreases in plasma total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and
      LDL-cholesterol, whereas there were no significant changes in triglycerides,
      IDL-cholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol. Climacteric symptoms, particularly
      vasomotor episodes, decreased similarly in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both
      tibolone and CEE/MPA were safe with respect to effects on the endometrium and
      both treatments induced changes in the plasma profiles of certain lipid and
      lipoprotein parameters. However, the overall clinical implications of these
      changes are unknown. Finally, both regimens were equally effective in the
      treatment of climacteric symptoms.

TI  - Effects of estrogen or estrogen/progestin regimens on heart disease risk factors 
      in postmenopausal women. The Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions
      (PEPI) Trial. The Writing Group for the PEPI Trial.
PG  - 199-208
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess pairwise differences between placebo, unopposed estrogen,
      and each of three estrogen/progestin regimens on selected heart disease risk
      factors in healthy postmenopausal women. DESIGN: A 3-year, multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 875 
      healthy postmenopausal women aged 45 to 64 years who had no known
      contraindication to hormone therapy. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly
      assigned in equal numbers to the following groups: (1) placebo; (2) conjugated
      equine estrogen (CEE), 0.625 mg/d; (3) CEE, 0.625 mg/d plus cyclic
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 10 mg/d for 12 d/mo; (4) CEE, 0.625 mg/d plus 
      consecutive MPA, 2.5 mg/d; or (5) CEE, 0.625 mg/d plus cyclic micronized
      progesterone (MP), 200 mg/d for 12 d/mo. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS: Four endpoints were
      chosen to represent four biological systems related to the risk of cardiovascular
      disease: (1) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), (2) systolic blood
      pressure, (3) serum insulin, and (4) fibrinogen. ANALYSIS: Analyses presented are
      by intention to treat. P values for primary endpoints are adjusted for multiple
      comparisons; 95% confidence intervals around estimated effects were calculated
      without this adjustment. RESULTS: Mean changes in HDL-C segregated treatment
      regimens into three statistically distinct groups: (1) placebo (decrease of 0.03 
      mmol/L [1.2 mg/dL]); (2) MPA regimens (increases of 0.03 to 0.04 mmol/L [1.2 to
      1.6 mg/dL]); and (3) CEE with cyclic MP (increase of 0.11 mmol/L [4.1 mg/dL]) and
      CEE alone (increase of 0.14 mmol/L [5.6 mg/dL]). Active treatments decreased mean
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.37 to 0.46 mmol/L [14.5 to 17.7 mg/dL])
      and increased mean triglyceride (0.13 to 0.15 mmol/L [11.4 to 13.7 mg/dL])
      compared with placebo. Placebo was associated with a significantly greater
      increase in mean fibrinogen than any active treatment (0.10 g/L compared with
      -0.02 to 0.06 g/L); differences among active treatments were not significant.
      Systolic blood pressure increased and postchallenge insulin levels decreased
      during the trial, but neither varied significantly by treatment assignment.
      Compared with other active treatments, unopposed estrogen was associated with a
      significantly increased risk of adenomatous or atypical hyperplasia (34% vs 1%)
      and of hysterectomy (6% vs 1%). No other adverse effect differed by treatment
      assignment or hysterectomy status. CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen alone or in combination 
      with a progestin improves lipoproteins and lowers fibrinogen levels without
      detectable effects on postchallenge insulin or blood pressure. Unopposed estrogen
      is the optimal regimen for elevation of HDL-C, but the high rate of endometrial
      hyperplasia restricts use to women without a uterus. In women with a uterus, CEE 
      with cyclic MP has the most favorable effect on HDL-C and no excess risk of
      endometrial hyperplasia.

TI  - Induction of amenorrhea during hormone replacement therapy: optimal micronized
      progesterone dose. A multicenter study.
PG  - 103-15
AB  - The effects of oral micronized progesterone on the endometrium and bleeding
      pattern have been assessed in a multicenter study of 101 postmenopausal patients.
      During a minimum of 6 cycles, the participants received either percutaneous 17
      beta-estradiol (1.5 mg/day) associated with micronized progesterone (100 mg/day),
      given at bedtime for 21/28 days or 25 days/calendar month (n = 98) [1], or E2 (3 
      mg/day) for 25 days associated with progesterone (300 mg/day), from day 16 to day
      25 (n = 3) [2], according to their willingness to induce, or not, cyclic
      withdrawal bleeding. Each endometrial biopsy performed at 6-month minimum was
      assessed by two independent pathologists: results showed 61% quiescent without
      mitosis, 23% mildly active with very rare mitoses and 8% partial secretory
      endometrium. The remaining biopsies showed inadequate tissue (4%) or a
      sub-atrophy (4%). No hyperplasia was found by any pathologist. In the case of
      inadequate material, the mean thickness of endometrial mucosa measured by
      ultrasonography was 3.9 mm. Amenorrhea incidence was 93.3 and 91.6% at the 3rd
      and 6th month of therapy, respectively. No bleeding occurred in more than 80% of 
      women. The results show that a low dose of oral progesterone (100 mg/day), given 
      during 25 days, efficiently protects the endometrium by fully inhibiting mitoses 
      and induces amenorrhea in the majority of postmenopausal women, allowing better
      compliance to long-term therapy.
