TI  - Effectiveness and cost of olanzapine and haloperidol in the treatment of
      schizophrenia: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2693-702
AB  - CONTEXT: Although olanzapine has been widely adopted as a treatment of choice for
      schizophrenia, its long-term effectiveness and costs have not been evaluated in a
      controlled trial in comparison with a standard antipsychotic drug. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the effectiveness and cost impact of olanzapine compared with
      haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Double-blind, 
      randomized controlled trial with randomization conducted between June 1998 and
      June 2000 at 17 US Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Three hundred nine patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fourth Edition diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder,
      serious symptoms, and serious dysfunction for the previous 2 years. Fifty-nine
      percent fully completed and 36% partially completed follow-up assessments.
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive flexibly dosed
      olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d, with prophylactic benztropine, 1 to 4 mg/d (n = 159);
      or haloperidol, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 150), for 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Standardized measures of symptoms, quality of life, neurocognitive status, and
      adverse effects of medication. Veterans Affairs administrative data and
      interviews concerning non-VA service use were used to estimate costs from the
      perspective of the VA health care system and society as a whole (ie, consumption 
      of all resources on behalf of these patients). RESULTS: There were no significant
      differences between groups in study retention; positive, negative, or total
      symptoms of schizophrenia; quality of life; or extrapyramidal symptoms.
      Olanzapine was associated with reduced akathisia in the intention-to-treat
      analysis (P<.001) and with lower symptoms of tardive dyskinesia in a secondary
      analysis including only observations during blinded treatment with study drug.
      Small but significant advantages were also observed on measures of memory and
      motor function. Olanzapine was also associated with more frequent reports of
      weight gain and significantly greater VA costs, ranging from 3000 dollars to 9000
      dollars annually. Differences in societal costs were somewhat smaller and were
      not significant. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine does not demonstrate advantages compared 
      with haloperidol (in combination with prophylactic benztropine) in compliance,
      symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, or overall quality of life, and its benefits
      in reducing akathisia and improving cognition must be balanced with the problems 
      of weight gain and higher cost.

TI  - A placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of
      aripiprazole in patients with acute bipolar mania.
PG  - 1651-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole, a novel 
      antipsychotic, to placebo for treatment of patients in an acute manic or mixed
      episode of bipolar disorder. METHOD: This 3-week, multicenter, double-blind study
      randomly assigned 262 bipolar disorder patients in an acute manic or mixed
      episode to aripiprazole, 30 mg/day (reduced to 15 mg/day if needed for
      tolerability), or placebo. Patients remained hospitalized for at least 2 of the
      weeks. The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline in total score 
      on the Young Mania Rating Scale; response was defined as a decrease in score of >
      or =50%. RESULTS: Aripiprazole produced statistically significant mean
      improvements in total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale compared with placebo
      (-8.2 versus -3.4, respectively) and produced a significantly higher response
      rate (40% versus 19%). For key efficacy variables (response per Young Mania
      Rating Scale; Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version scores for severity of
      illness [mania] and change from preceding phase [mania]), aripiprazole separated 
      from placebo by day 4. The completion rate was significantly higher with
      aripiprazole than with placebo (42% versus 21%). Discontinuations due to adverse 
      events did not differ significantly between the aripiprazole and placebo groups. 
      There were no significant changes in body weight versus placebo, and aripiprazole
      was not associated with elevated serum prolactin or QTc prolongation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Aripiprazole had significantly greater efficacy than placebo for the
      treatment of bipolar disorder patients in acute manic or mixed episodes and was
      safe and well tolerated in this randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Randomized trial of olanzapine versus placebo in the symptomatic acute treatment 
      of the schizophrenic prodrome.
PG  - 453-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prodromal phase of schizophrenic disorders has been described
      prospectively. The present study aimed to determine the short-term efficacy and
      safety of olanzapine treatment of prodromal symptoms compared with placebo.
      METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-groups, placebo-controlled
      trial with fixed-flexible dosing conducted at four sites. Sixty patients met
      prodromal diagnostic criteria, including attenuated psychotic symptoms, as
      determined by structured interviews. Olanzapine 5-15 mg daily or placebo was
      prescribed for 8 weeks. RESULTS: In the mixed-effects, repeated-measures
      analysis, the treatment x time interaction for the change from baseline on the
      Scale of Prodromal Symptoms total score was statistically significant, and post
      hoc analyses revealed that the olanzapine-placebo difference reached p<.10 by
      week 6 and p<.05 at week 8. Ratings of extrapyramidal symptoms remained low in
      each group and were not significantly different. Olanzapine patients gained 9.9
      lb versus.7 lb for placebo patients (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This short-term
      analysis suggests olanzapine is associated with significantly greater symptomatic
      improvement but significantly greater weight gain than is placebo in prodromal
      patients. Extrapyramidal symptoms with olanzapine were minimal and similar to
      those with placebo. Future research over the longer term with more patients will 
      be needed before recommendations can be made regarding routine treatment.

TI  - Predicting suicidal risk in schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients in a
      prospective two-year trial.
PG  - 444-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enhanced ability to reliably identify risk factors for suicidal
      behavior permits more focused decisions concerning treatment interventions and
      support services, with potential reduction in lives lost to suicide. METHODS:
      This study followed 980 patients at high risk for suicide in a multicenter
      prospective study for 2 years after randomization to clozapine or olanzapine. A
      priori predictors related to diagnosis, treatment resistance, and clinical
      constructs of disease symptoms were evaluated as possible predictors of
      subsequent suicide-related events. RESULTS: Ten baseline univariate predictors
      were identified. Historical predictors were diagnosis of schizoaffective
      disorder, history or current use at baseline of alcohol or substance abuse,
      cigarette smoking, number of lifetime suicide attempts, and the number of
      hospitalizations in the previous 36 months to prevent suicide. Predictive
      clinical features included greater baseline scores on the InterSePT scale for
      suicidal thinking, the Covi Anxiety Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale (CDS),
      and severity of Parkinsonism. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed the
      number of hospitalizations in the previous 36 months, baseline CDS, severity of
      Parkinson's, history of substance abuse, and lifetime suicide attempts.
      Clozapine, in general, was more effective than olanzapine in decreasing the risk 
      of suicidality, regardless of risk factors present. CONCLUSIONS: This is the
      first prospective analysis of predictors of suicide risk in a large schizophrenic
      and schizoaffective population judged to be at high risk for suicide. Assessment 
      of these risk factors may aid clinicians in evaluating risk for suicidal
      behaviors so that appropriate interventions can be made.

TI  - The National Institute of Mental Health Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of
      Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) project: schizophrenia trial design and
      protocol development.
PG  - 15-31
AB  - The National Institute of Mental Health initiated the Clinical Antipsychotic
      Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) program to evaluate the
      effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in typical settings and populations so that 
      the study results will be maximally useful in routine clinical situations. The
      CATIE schizophrenia trial blends features of efficacy studies and large, simple
      trials to create a pragmatic trial that will provide extensive information about 
      antipsychotic drug effectiveness over at least 18 months. The protocol allows for
      subjects who receive a study drug that is not effective to receive subsequent
      treatments within the context of the study. Medication dosages are adjusted
      within a defined range according to clinical judgment. The primary outcome is
      all-cause treatment discontinuation because it represents an important clinical
      endpoint that reflects both clinician and patient judgments about efficacy and
      tolerability. Secondary outcomes include symptoms, side effects, neurocognitive
      functioning, and cost-effectiveness. Approximately 50 clinical sites across the
      United States are seeking to enroll a total of 1,500 persons with schizophrenia. 
      Phase 1 is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial comparing treatment with
      the second generation antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and
      ziprasidone to perphenazine, a midpotency first generation antipsychotic. If the 
      initially assigned medication is not effective, subjects may choose one of the
      following phase 2 trials: (1) randomization to open-label clozapine or a
      double-blinded second generation drug that was available but not assigned in
      phase 1; or (2) double-blinded randomization to ziprasidone or another second
      generation drug that was available but not assigned in phase 1. If the phase 2
      study drug is discontinued, subjects may enter phase 3, in which clinicians help 
      subjects select an open-label treatment based on individuals' experiences in
      phases 1 and 2.

TI  - Maintenance treatment of schizophrenia with risperidone or haloperidol: 2-year
      outcomes.
PG  - 1405-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most controlled studies comparing second-generation and conventional
      antipsychotics have focused on the acute treatment of schizophrenia. The authors 
      compared symptom outcomes, side effects, and social adjustment in stable
      schizophrenia outpatients who received 2 years of maintenance treatment with
      risperidone or haloperidol. METHOD: This was a 2-year, randomized, double-blind
      comparison of 6 mg of risperidone versus haloperidol in 63 patients with
      stabilized DSM-IV schizophrenia. Study patients also received 15 months of
      standard behavioral skills training or enhanced training with a case manager who 
      promoted patients' use of their skills in the community. RESULTS: The risk of
      psychotic exacerbations and the risk of leaving the study were similar for both
      drug treatment groups. However, patients who received both risperidone and the
      enhanced community-based skills training were more likely to remain in the study 
      than those in the other treatment groups. Patients demonstrated significant
      improvement in score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale over time with both
      medications. There were no between-group differences in cluster scores for
      thought disturbance, hostile-suspiciousness, and withdrawal-retardation. A
      significant between-group difference favoring risperidone was found for the
      anxious-depression cluster. Risperidone resulted in significantly greater
      reductions in tremor and akathisia and greater improvements in most items on the 
      SCL-90-R. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with patients given a low dose of
      haloperidol, risperidone-treated patients experienced similar improvements in
      positive and negative symptoms and similar risks of psychotic exacerbations.
      However, risperidone-treated patients appeared to feel subjectively better, as
      indicated by less anxiety and depression and fewer extrapyramidal side effects.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of atypical and conventional antipsychotic drugs 
      in first-episode psychosis: a randomized, double-blind trial of olanzapine versus
      haloperidol.
PG  - 1396-404
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few long-term studies have compared the efficacy and safety of typical
      and atypical antipsychotic medications directly in patients with a first episode 
      of psychosis who met the criteria for schizophrenia or a related psychotic
      disorder. This study compared the acute and long-term effectiveness of
      haloperidol with that of olanzapine in patients with first-episode psychosis in a
      large, controlled clinical trial. METHOD: Patients with first-episode psychosis
      (N=263) were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive
      haloperidol or olanzapine and were followed for up to 104 weeks. Domains measured
      included psychopathology, psychosocial variables, neurocognitive functioning, and
      brain morphology and metabolism. This report presents data from clinical measures
      of treatment response and safety data from the 12-week acute treatment phase.
      RESULTS: Haloperidol and olanzapine were associated with substantial and
      comparable baseline-to-endpoint reductions in symptom severity, which did not
      differ significantly in last-observation-carried-forward analyses. However, in a 
      mixed-model analysis, olanzapine-treated subjects had significantly greater
      decreases in symptom severity as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale total score and negative and general scales and by the Montgomery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale but not as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale positive scale and by the Clinical Global Impression severity rating.
      Olanzapine-treated patients experienced a lower rate of treatment-emergent
      parkinsonism and akathisia but had significantly more weight gain, compared with 
      the haloperidol-treated patients. Overall, significantly more olanzapine-treated 
      subjects than haloperidol-treated subjects completed the 12-week acute phase of
      the study (67% versus 54%). CONCLUSIONS: As expected on the basis of previous
      studies, both olanzapine and haloperidol were effective in the acute reduction of
      psychopathological symptoms in this group of patients with first-episode
      psychosis. However, olanzapine had several relative advantages in therapeutic
      response. Although the nature of adverse events differed between the two agents, 
      retention in the study was greater with olanzapine. Retention in treatment is
      important in this patient population, given their risk of relapse. Longer-term
      results are needed to determine whether treatment with atypical antipsychotics
      results in superior outcomes for a first episode of schizophrenia.

TI  - Differential effect of quetiapine on depressive symptoms in patients with
      partially responsive schizophrenia.
PG  - 210-5
AB  - While atypical antipsychotics appear to be effective in reducing depressive
      symptoms in the acute phase of schizophrenia, little is known about their
      efficacy in patients with ongoing symptoms. The present study assessed whether
      quetiapine (Seroquel) is more effective than haloperidol in treating depressive
      symptoms in patients with persistent positive symptoms, and investigated whether 
      this effect is independent, or secondary to, reductions in other symptoms such as
      positive, negative or extrapyramidal symptoms. Patients with schizophrenia and a 
      history of partial refractoriness to conventional antipsychotics who had not
      responded to 4 weeks of fluphenazine treatment (20 mg/day) were randomized to
      receive either quetiapine (600 mg/day) or haloperidol (20 mg/day) for a further 8
      weeks. Change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale depression factor score
      from baseline to endpoint was calculated and path analyses were performed on data
      from 269 patients. Quetiapine produced a greater reduction in depressive scores
      than haloperidol (-1.60 versus -0.54; p = 0.006). The path analyses indicated
      that this was a direct effect on depressive symptoms. These findings extend the
      evidence for an antidepressant effect for the novel antipsychotics in
      schizophrenia, and suggest that this is not limited to acutely psychotic
      patients.

TI  - Olanzapine versus divalproex sodium for the treatment of acute mania and
      maintenance of remission: a 47-week study.
PG  - 1263-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few double-blind trials have compared longer-term efficacy and safety 
      of medications for bipolar disorder. The authors report a 47-week comparison of
      olanzapine and divalproex. METHOD: This 47-week, randomized, double-blind study
      compared flexibly dosed olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) to divalproex (500-2500 mg/day) 
      for manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder (N=251). The only other
      psychoactive medication allowed was lorazepam for agitation. The primary efficacy
      instrument was the Young Mania Rating Scale; a priori protocol-defined threshold 
      scores were > or =20 for inclusion, < or =12 for remission, and > or = 15 for
      relapse. Analytical techniques included mixed model repeated-measures analysis of
      variance for change from baseline, Fisher's exact test (two-tailed) for
      categorical comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to events of
      interest. RESULTS: Over 47 weeks, mean improvement in Young Mania Rating Scale
      score was significantly greater for the olanzapine group. Median time to
      symptomatic mania remission was significantly shorter for olanzapine, 14 days,
      than for divalproex, 62 days. There were no significant differences between
      treatments in the rates of symptomatic mania remission over the 47 weeks (56.8%
      and 45.5%, respectively) and subsequent relapse into mania or depression (42.3%
      and 56.5%). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurring significantly more
      frequently during olanzapine treatment were somnolence, dry mouth, increased
      appetite, weight gain, akathisia, and high alanine aminotransferase levels; those
      for divalproex were nausea and nervousness. CONCLUSIONS: In this 47-week study of
      acute bipolar mania, symptomatic remission occurred sooner and overall mania
      improvement was greater for olanzapine than for divalproex, but rates of bipolar 
      relapse did not differ.

TI  - Relapse prevention in schizophrenia with new-generation antipsychotics: a
      systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials.
PG  - 1209-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies
      of the potential of new-generation antipsychotic drugs to improve adherence and
      decrease relapse rates in patients with schizophrenia. METHOD: Randomized,
      controlled trials comparing new-generation antipsychotic drugs with placebo
      and/or conventional antipsychotics were identified. Data on relapse, general
      treatment failure, and dropout due to adverse events were extracted and combined 
      in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Because few trials were available for each
      individual drug, the effects of new-generation antipsychotic drugs as a group
      were analyzed. The analysis of six placebo comparisons, involving a total of 983 
      patients, clearly demonstrated that new-generation antipsychotic drugs are
      effective for relapse prevention. Eleven studies with a total of 2,032 patients
      provided comparative data on relapse/treatment failure for new-generation and
      conventional antipsychotics. The analysis revealed that rates of relapse and
      overall treatment failure were modestly but significantly lower with the newer
      drugs. Whether this advantage was partly mediated by improved adherence to
      treatment remains unclear. No significant superiority in terms of fewer dropouts 
      due to adverse events was found for the newer drugs. Furthermore, a number of
      methodological problems were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the currently
      available data suggest that new-generation antipsychotics have the potential to
      reduce relapse rates. Methodological issues to be addressed in future trials
      include the choice of comparator, use of appropriate doses, application of
      clinically relevant relapse criteria, monitoring of adherence, and minimization
      of dropouts.

TI  - A double-blind comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone in the acute treatment
      of dementia-related behavioral disturbances in extended care facilities.
PG  - 726-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: In addition to demonstrating their superiority to placebo, there is a
      need to compare the relative efficacy and side effects of atypical neuroleptics
      for the acute treatment of dementia-related behavioral disturbances in residents 
      of long-term care facilities. METHOD: In a double-blind parallel study allowing
      dose titration over 14 days, 39 agitated persons with DSM-IV dementia who were
      residing in long-term care facilities were administered olanzapine (N = 20) or
      risperidone (N = 19) as acute treatment. Drug was administered once a day at
      bedtime. The initial dosages were olanzapine, 2.5 mg/day, and risperidone, 0.5
      mg/day. Titration was allowed to maximum doses of olanzapine, 10 mg/day, and
      risperidone, 2.0 mg/day. The primary outcome measures were the Clinical Global
      Impressions scale (CGI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Data were
      gathered from 2000 to 2002. RESULTS: Both drugs produced significant reductions
      in CGI and NPI scores (p <.0001), but there was no significant difference between
      drugs. The mean olanzapine dose was 6.65 mg/day; for risperidone, the dose was
      1.47 mg/day. The positive drug effect was not accompanied by decreased mobility, 
      and there was improvement on a quality-of-life measure. The chief adverse events 
      were drowsiness and falls. At baseline, 42% (16/38) of subjects in both groups
      had extrapyramidal symptoms that increased slightly, but not significantly, by
      the end of the study. CONCLUSION: Low-dose, once-a-day olanzapine and risperidone
      appear to be equally safe and equally effective in the treatment of
      dementia-related behavioral disturbances in residents of extended care
      facilities.

TI  - A meta-analysis of the efficacy of second-generation antipsychotics.
PG  - 553-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consensus panel recommendations regarding choice of an antipsychotic 
      agent for schizophrenia differ markedly, but most consider second-generation
      antipsychotics (SGAs) as a homogeneous group. It has been suggested that SGAs
      seem falsely more efficacious than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) as a
      result of reduced efficacy due to use of a high-dose comparator, haloperidol. We 
      performed (1) a meta-analysis of randomized efficacy trials comparing SGAs and
      FGAs, (2) comparisons between SGAs, (3) a dose-response analysis of FGAs and
      SGAs, and (4) an analysis of the effect on efficacy of an overly high dose of an 
      FGA comparator. METHODS: Literature search of clinical trials between January
      1953 and May 2002 of patients with schizophrenia from electronic databases,
      reference lists, posters, the Food and Drug Administration, and other unpublished
      data. We included 124 randomized controlled trials with efficacy data on 10 SGAs 
      vs FGAs and 18 studies of comparisons between SGAs. Two of us independently
      extracted the sample sizes, means, and standard deviation of the efficacy data.
      RESULTS: Using the Hedges-Olkin algorithm, the effect sizes of clozapine,
      amisulpride, risperidone, and olanzapine were 0.49, 0.29, 0.25, and 0.21 greater 
      than those of FGAs, with P values of 2 x 10-8, 3 x 10-7, 2 x 10-12, and 3 x 10-9,
      respectively. The remaining 6 SGAs were not significantly different from FGAs,
      although zotepine was marginally different. No efficacy difference was detected
      among amisulpride, risperidone, and olanzapine. We found no evidence that the
      haloperidol dose (or all FGA comparators converted to haloperidol-equivalent
      doses) affected these results when we examined its effect by drug or in a 2-way
      analysis of variance model in which SGA effectiveness is entered as a second
      factor. CONCLUSION: Some SGAs are more efficacious than FGAs, and, therefore,
      SGAs are not a homogeneous group.

      medications.
PG  - 589-605
AB  - To assess the cost and effectiveness of risperidone, olanzapine, and conventional
      antipsychotic medications under "usual practice" conditions in a large, public
      mental health system, 108 persons diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder were randomly assigned to one of these three medication groups and
      followed prospectively over a 12-month period using standard instruments and
      procedures. Psychiatric medication costs increased more over time in both the
      olanzapine and risperidone groups than in the conventional medication group.
      Compliance with the prescribed medication was higher in the olanzapine group than
      in the conventional group. No differential effects by medication group were
      evident in this sample on the symptoms of schizophrenia, side effects,
      psychosocial functioning, time to discharge for index hospitalization, survival
      to initial rehospitalization, or client satisfaction with services. These results
      extend findings from previous efficacy and naturalistic studies in several ways
      but are limited chiefly by the small number of subjects who completed 6 to 12
      months of the clinical trial, and the resulting power to detect differences in
      the statistical analyses.

TI  - Safety, effectiveness, and quality of life of olanzapine in first-episode
      schizophrenia: a naturalistic study.
PG  - 667-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness, safety, and quality of life
      (Qol) offered by olanzapine in first-episode schizophrenia. METHOD: One hundred
      and eighty-two patients with first-episode schizophrenia (ICD-10) drawn from a
      larger, naturalistic, study were evaluated after 6 months of treatment with
      olanzapine, risperidone, or conventional antipsychotics (CA). Clinical status was
      assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and Global
      Assessment of Function (GAF). AWAD and EuroQol scales were used to evaluate
      patients' attitude towards medication and Qol, respectively. RESULTS: Subjects
      treated with olanzapine, risperidone, and CA showed similar improvements on CGI-S
      and GAF. Treatment-emergent, extrapyramidal symptoms were significantly lower in 
      olanzapine-treated patients (17.8%) than in the risperidone (46.4%) and CA
      (62.2%) groups. Compared to CA, olanzapine and risperidone showed significantly
      greater improvement on the visual analog scale of EuroQol. Olanzapine-treated
      patients also showed significantly improved AWAD scores. CONCLUSIONS: In
      first-episode schizophrenia, atypical antipsychotics were effective, and improved
      Qol. Olanzapine had a lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms and better
      subjective acceptance of medication.

TI  - The impact upon extra-pyramidal side effects, clinical symptoms and quality of
      life of a switch from conventional to atypical antipsychotics (risperidone or
      olanzapine) in elderly patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 432-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical antipsychotics are commonly used in the management of
      schizophrenia in late life with evidence suggesting they induce lower rates of
      motor disturbance, but have similar efficacy to conventional antipsychotics.
      Trials in the elderly have been either retrospective, small, of short duration or
      of a single-arm design. AIMS: To demonstrate the effects upon motor side-effects,
      efficacy, safety and quality of life (QOL) of switching elderly patients with
      schizophrenia from conventional antipsychotics to olanzapine or risperidone.
      METHODS: Elderly patients with schizophrenia were randomly allocated to
      olanzapine or risperidone and followed through an open-label crossover period.
      Between and within group intention to treat analyses were conducted. RESULTS: 66 
      patients were randomised (mean age 69.6 [SD +/- 6.2]). Four (11.8%) patients on
      olanzapine and 8 (26.7%) patients on risperidone failed to complete the crossover
      because of treatment failure [Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.73[0.73-10.2] p = 0.14]. The
      mean doses upon completion of switching in each arm were 9.9 mg (SD = 4.2) and
      1.7 mg (SD = 1.2) for olanzapine and risperidone respectively. In both arms there
      was improvement in Parkinsonism, though only olanzapine was associated with a
      reduction in dyskinetic symptoms. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Scale for
      the assessment of Negative Symptoms and Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale scores all improved through the crossover period in both arms with no
      between group differences. Treatment with olanzapine was associated with a better
      response over risperidone on the psychological domain of the World Health
      Organisation-Quality Of Life [Brief] (WHO-QOL-BREF) scale ( p = 0.02). Patients
      in the olanzapine arm also demonstrated improvement from baseline in the
      WHO-QOL-BREF physical, psychological and health satisfaction domains, but
      risperidone had no effect on any Quality of Life (QOL) measure. CONCLUSIONS:
      After switching from a conventional antipsychotic, olanzapine and risperidone
      were associated with improvement in core symptoms of schizophrenia and motor side
      effects. Subjects switched to olanzapine were more likely to complete the
      switching process and show an improvement in psychological QOL.

TI  - The effectiveness of quetiapine versus conventional antipsychotics in improving
      cognitive and functional outcomes in standard treatment settings.
PG  - 524-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of quetiapine versus conventional
      antipsychotics in improving cognitive and functional outcomes. METHOD: Forty
      stable outpatients with DSM-IV schizophrenia treated in public outpatient clinics
      were randomly assigned to continue taking conventional antipsychotic medications 
      or switch to quetiapine for 6 months, beginning September 1998 and ending July
      2000. Neurocognitive and functional measures were obtained at study entry, 3
      months, and 6 months by raters blinded to treatment. Group differences were
      examined using repeated-measures analyses of covariance for mixed models.
      RESULTS: The mean (SD) dose of conventional antipsychotics in chlorpromazine
      equivalents was 348.00 (348.28) mg/day; the mean (SD) dose of quetiapine was
      319.25 (142.55) mg/day. A cognitive function summary score improved in the
      quetiapine group relative to the group treated with conventional antipsychotics
      over the 6-month period (F = 5.80, df = 1,28.9; p <.023). Patients taking
      quetiapine did better with respect to both verbal fluency (initiation) and verbal
      memory. There were also statistically significant group differences with respect 
      to quality of life favoring the quetiapine group (F = 4.87, df = 1,29; p <.04).
      Differences were not found with respect to adaptive functioning. CONCLUSION:
      Quetiapine improved cognition relative to conventional agents. After 6 months,
      groups differed by more than 1 standard deviation when baseline cognitive
      functioning was taken into account. No group differences were found with respect 
      to improvements in community functioning. Improvements in adaptive functioning
      may lag behind improvements in cognition. Psychosocial programming may be
      necessary to translate gains in cognition into improvements in adaptive
      functioning.

TI  - New generation antipsychotics versus low-potency conventional antipsychotics: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1581-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clearest advantage of new generation, atypical antipsychotics is 
      a reduced risk of extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), compared with conventional
      compounds. These findings might have been biased by the use of the high-potency
      antipsychotic haloperidol as a comparator in most of the trials. We aimed to
      establish whether the new drugs induce fewer EPS than low-potency conventional
      antipsychotics. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of all randomised controlled
      trials in which new generation antipsychotics had been compared with low-potency 
      (equivalent or less potent than chlorpromazine) conventional drugs. We included
      studies that met quality criteria A or B in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, 
      and assessed quality with the Jadad scale. The primary outcome of interest was
      the number of patients who had at least one EPS. We used risk differences and 95%
      CIs as measures of effect size. FINDINGS: We identified 31 studies with a total
      of 2320 participants. Of the new generation drugs, only clozapine was associated 
      with significantly fewer EPS (RD=-0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.4, p=0.008) and higher
      efficacy than low-potency conventional drugs. Reduced frequency of EPS seen with 
      olanzapine was of borderline significance (-0.15, -0.31 to -0.01, p=0.07). Only
      one inconclusive trial of amisulpride, quetiapine, and risperidone and no
      investigations of ziprasidone and sertindole were identified, but some evidence
      indicates that zotepine and remoxipride do not lead to fewer EPS than low-potency
      antipsychotics. Mean doses less than 600 mg/day of chlorpromazine or its
      equivalent had no higher risk of EPS than new generation drugs. As a group, new
      generation drugs were moderately more efficacious than low-potency
      antipsychotics, largely irrespective of the comparator doses used.
      INTERPRETATION: Optimum doses of low-potency conventional antipsychotics might
      not induce more EPS than new generation drugs. Potential advantages in efficacy
      of the new generation drugs should be a factor in clinical treatment decisions to
      use these rather than conventional drugs.

TI  - Olanzapine vs risperidone in the management of schizophrenia: a randomized
      double-blind trial in Australia and New Zealand.
PG  - 303-14
AB  - Improved drug therapy for schizophrenia may represent the best strategy for
      reducing the costs of schizophrenia and the recurrent chronic course of the
      disease. Olanzapine and risperidone are atypical antipsychotic agents developed
      to meet this need. We report a multicenter, double-blind, parallel, 30-week study
      designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and associated resource use for
      olanzapine and risperidone in Australia and New Zealand. The study sample
      consisted of 65 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder. Olanzapine-treated
      patients showed a significantly greater reduction in Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, and
      PANSS General Psychopathology scores at endpoint compared to the
      risperidone-treated patients. Response rates through 30 weeks showed a
      significantly greater proportion of olanzapine-treated patients had achieved a
      20% or greater improvement in their PANSS total score compared to
      risperidone-treated patients. Olanzapine and risperidone were equivalent in their
      improvement of PANSS positive and negative scores and Clinical Global
      Impression-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) at endpoint. Using generic and
      disease-specific measures of quality of life, olanzapine-treated patients showed 
      significant within-group improvement in most measures, and significant
      differences were observed in favor of olanzapine over risperidone in Quality of
      Life Scale (QLS) Intrapsychic Foundation and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form
      36-item instrument (SF-36) Role Functioning Limitations-Emotional subscale
      scores. Despite the relatively small sample size, our study suggests that
      olanzapine has a superior risk:benefit profile compared to risperidone.

TI  - Clinical trial response and dropout rates with olanzapine versus risperidone.
PG  - 556-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: In schizophrenia, comparing treatment dropouts between olanzapine and
      risperidone can be useful to better understand their relative effectiveness.
      OBJECTIVE: To analyze the differences in the rates of dropout from clinical
      trials and response between these 2 antipsychotics. METHODS: Literature search
      was based on MEDLINE (1966-May 2002). Analysis 1 included 4 randomized studies
      (838 patients), analysis 2 included 2 randomized studies (n = 716), and analysis 
      3 assessed 5 clinical studies for olanzapine (n = 928) and 3 for risperidone (n =
      290). Odds ratios were estimated by the fixed-effect model. RESULTS: The risk of 
      treatment discontinuation (analysis 1) was significantly greater for risperidone 
      than for olanzapine (42% vs. 33%, respectively). The response rates were
      identical for the 2 drugs (analysis 2). A slightly better pattern of maintenance 
      of response was found for olanzapine (analysis 3). CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of
      dropout and maintenance of remission seems to be better controlled for olanzapine
      than for risperidone.

TI  - Acute dysphoric mania: treatment response to olanzapine versus placebo.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - A substantial number of patients with mania have significant concomitant
      depressive features, and they may respond differently to mood stabilizers than
      patients with pure mania. This post-hoc analysis explored the response
      characteristics of olanzapine versus placebo in bipolar I manic patients with
      dysphoric and nondysphoric mania (differentiated by baseline Hamilton Depression 
      Rating Scale [HAM-D] score of >20). Two similar, double-blind, randomized trials 
      comparing olanzapine, 5-20 mg, to placebo were pooled for these analyses (N =
      246). Mean changes in Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) and HAM-D scores during 3 
      weeks of treatment were examined. Twenty-eight percent of patients had dysphoric 
      mania (olanzapine, n = 33; placebo, n = 35). Among these patients,
      olanzapine-treated patients had greater improvement within 1 week than did
      placebo-treated patients on both mania ratings (Y-MRS: -9.7 vs. -3.0 points; =
      0.011) and depressive symptom ratings (HAM-D: -9.9 vs. -5.4 points; = 0.025).
      Among those manic subjects without prominent depressive symptoms (olanzapine, n =
      91; placebo, n = 87), mean Y-MRS improvement from baseline to endpoint with
      olanzapine (-11.5 points) versus placebo (-6.13 points) was comparable to the
      improvement seen with olanzapine versus placebo in the dysphoric mania subgroup (
      = 0.476, test of interaction). In acutely ill manic patients with significant
      depressive symptoms, olanzapine demonstrated a broad spectrum of efficacy,
      effectively treating both manic and depressive symptoms. The magnitude of the
      antimanic response appears similar, regardless of baseline depressive features.
      Additional experience with putative mood stabilizers and atypical agents in mixed
      mania should include an exploration of their efficacy in treating both manic and 
      depressive mood symptoms.

TI  - A randomized placebo-controlled trial of risperidone for the treatment of
      aggression, agitation, and psychosis of dementia.
PG  - 134-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the 
      efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of aggression, agitation, and
      psychosis in elderly nursing-home patients with dementia. METHOD: Elderly
      patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type, vascular
      dementia, or a combination of the 2 (i.e., mixed dementia) and significant
      aggressive behaviors were randomized to receive, for a period of 12 weeks, a
      flexible dose of either placebo or risperidone solution up to a maximum of 2
      mg/day. Outcome measures were the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the
      Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) rating scale, and the
      Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and of Change (CGI-C) scales.
      RESULTS: A total of 345 patients were randomized to treatment with risperidone or
      placebo, and 337 patients received at least one dose of study drug. The trial was
      completed by 67% of patients in the placebo group and 73% of patients in the
      risperidone group. The mean +/- SE dose of risperidone was 0.95 +/- 0.03 mg/day. 
      The primary endpoint of the study, the difference from baseline to endpoint in
      CMAI total aggression score, showed a significant reduction in aggressive
      behavior for risperidone versus placebo (p <.001). A similar improvement was also
      seen for the CMAI total non-aggression subscale (p <.002) and for the BEHAVE-AD
      total (p <.001) and psychotic symptoms subscale (p =.004). At endpoint, the CGI-S
      and the CGI-C scores indicated a significantly greater improvement with
      risperidone compared with placebo (p <.001). Overall, 94% and 92% of the
      risperidone and placebo groups, respectively, reported at least 1 adverse event. 
      Somnolence and urinary tract infection were more common with risperidone
      treatment, whereas agitation was more common with placebo. There was no
      significant difference in the number of patients who reported extrapyramidal
      symptoms between the risperidone (23%) and placebo (16%) groups. CONCLUSION:
      Treatment with low-dose (mean = 0.95 mg/day) risperidone resulted in significant 
      improvement in aggression, agitation, and psychosis associated with dementia.

TI  - Switching from depot antipsychotic drugs to olanzapine in patients with chronic
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 119-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic schizophrenia (DSM-IV criteria) often receive
      depot antipsychotic medications to assure longer administration and better
      compliance with their treatment regimen. This study evaluated whether patients
      stabilized on depot antipsychotic medication could be successfully transitioned
      to oral olanzapine. METHOD: In a 3-month open-label study, 26 clinically stable
      patients with schizophrenia taking depot antipsychotics for over 3 years were
      randomly assigned to continue on their current depot dose or to switch to oral
      olanzapine. Clinical ratings (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS],
      Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF] scale, and Clinical Global Impressions
      [CGI] scale) and side effect parameters (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
      [AIMS], Barnes Akathisia Scale, AMDP-5 scale, vital signs, and weight) were
      obtained monthly. RESULTS: Oral olanzapine patients (N = 13) demonstrated
      significant clinical improvement over the depot control group (N = 13) from
      baseline to 3-month endpoint (PANSS total, p =.012; PANSS general, p =.068; PANSS
      negative, p =.098; CGI-Improvement, p =.007; CGI-Severity, p =.026; GAF, p
      =.015). Side effect rating scales showed no statistical differences between the 2
      groups (AIMS, Barnes Akathisia Scale, AMDP-5, vital signs). The depot control
      group showed no statistical superiority in any measure except weight change (p
      =.0005). After 3 months, all olanzapine patients preferred olanzapine to their
      previous depot medications and chose to continue on olanzapine treatment.
      CONCLUSION: Clinicians may expect clinical improvement when switching chronically
      psychotic patients from traditional depot antipsychotic drugs to oral olanzapine.
      Switching may be completed within a 4-week period with relative compliance being 
      maintained and patients preferring oral olanzapine to their previous depot
      medications.

TI  - Flupenthixol versus risperidone: subjective quality of life as an important
      factor for compliance in chronic schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 37-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this paper was to compare the effects of
      flupenthixol and risperidone on subjective quality of life and attitude towards
      medication in chronic schizophrenic patients with mainly negative symptoms. In a 
      spectrum ranging from its typical end "haloperidol" to its atypical end
      "clozapine", flupenthixol has typical and atypical characteristics. METHODS: The 
      effects of flupenthixol versus risperidone were investigated in a multicenter,
      double-blind trial, whereas subjective quality of life was assessed by means of
      the EuroQuol-Visual Analogue Scale and the patient satisfaction questionnaire.
      The attitude towards medication was assessed by means of the Drug Attitude
      Inventory-30 (DAI-30). RESULTS: Mean daily dose of study medication was 6.6 (SD
      2.9) mg/day flupenthixol and 3.6 (SD 1.2) mg/day risperidone. Both groups showed 
      a significant improvement regarding subjective quality of life and positive
      attitude towards medication. Especially the categories "control of their
      thoughts", concentration and "feeling better in general" ameliorated in both
      groups. In the flupenthixol group, the "ability to cope with stress", "feel more 
      relaxed" and the "ability to achieve something" improved significantly more than 
      in the risperidone group. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The spectrum of schizophrenia can be
      treated effectively with different neuroleptic treatments. (2) Flupenthixol
      especially improves the ability to cope with stress, the ability to achieve
      something and feeling more relaxed. (3) Subjective quality of life significantly 
      increased with no difference between the groups.

TI  - The European Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcomes (SOHO) study: rationale,
      methods and recruitment.
PG  - 222-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the European Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcomes
      (SOHO) study is to understand the comparative costs and outcomes of antipsychotic
      drug treatment, with specific focus on olanzapine. The study will also provide a 
      large database for research into the treatment and outcome of schizophrenia. The 
      role of observational studies in the assessment of the effectiveness of
      antipsychotic agents is reviewed, and the rationale, design and recruitment
      issues surrounding the SOHO study are presented. METHOD: SOHO is a 3-year,
      prospective, observational study of the health outcomes associated with
      antipsychotic treatment in Europe. RESULTS: Over 10 000 patients have been
      recruited from 10 countries. Baseline evaluation included measures of clinical
      status, social functioning, quality of life, service use and pharmacological
      treatment. Patients will be followed for 3 years. CONCLUSION: The SOHO study will
      complement randomized controlled trial findings on the treatment of schizophrenia
      and will address relevant clinical and policy research questions.

TI  - Mood stabilisers plus risperidone or placebo in the treatment of acute mania.
      International, double-blind, randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few double-blind trials have examined the efficacy of a combination
      of a mood stabiliser and an atypical antipsychotic in acute mania. AIMS: To
      determine the efficacy of risperidone in combination with a mood stabiliser in
      acute mania. METHOD: Patients taking a mood stabiliser were randomised to 3
      weeks' treatment with risperidone (n=75) or placebo (n=76). RESULTS: Young Mania 
      Rating Scale (YMRS) scores improved rapidly with significantly greater reductions
      at week 1 in the risperidone group compared with the placebo group. At end-point 
      YMRS scores decreased by 14.5 and 10.3 points in the risperidone and placebo
      groups, respectively. Significant improvements v. placebo (P<0.05) were noted in 
      the risperidone group on several other clinically meaningful measures.
      Additionally, a post hoc analysis excluding carbamazepine-treated patients
      (plasma concentrations of risperidone active moiety were 40% lower in this group)
      revealed significantly greater reductions (P=0.047) in YMRS scores in the
      risperidone group than in the placebo group. Incidence of adverse events was
      similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone is superior to placebo when used
      in combination with lithium or divalproex in acute mania.

TI  - Subjective experience and D2 receptor occupancy in patients with recent-onset
      schizophrenia treated with low-dose olanzapine or haloperidol: a randomized,
      double-blind study.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors tested the hypothesis that a dopamine D(2) receptor
      occupancy level between 60% and 70% in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia
      would result in optimal subjective experience. In addition, they sought
      preliminary evidence on whether subjective experience is better with low-dose
      olanzapine than with low-dose haloperidol. METHOD: Subjects (N=24) who met DSM-IV
      criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind
      treatment with either olanzapine, 7.5 mg/day, or haloperidol, 2.5 mg/day.
      Subjective experience, psychopathology, and extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed
      at baseline and at endpoint. After 6 weeks, D(2) receptor occupancy was assessed 
      with [(123)I]iodobenzamide single photon emission computed tomography. RESULTS:
      The two study groups were similar at baseline. After 6 weeks, patients receiving 
      olanzapine had a significantly lower mean dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy
      (51.0%, range=36%-67%) than those given haloperidol (65.5%, range=45%-75%).
      Receptor occupancy between 60% and 70% was associated with optimal subjective
      experience, and subjective experience improved significantly in the haloperidol
      group. CONCLUSIONS: A level of D(2) receptor occupancy between 60% and 70% is
      optimal for subjective experience of patients with recent-onset schizophrenia.
      Substantial interindividual variation in D(2) receptor occupancy was seen at
      fixed low-dose levels of olanzapine and haloperidol. Olanzapine, 7.5 mg/day,
      showed no superior subjective response over haloperidol, 2.5 mg/day. Olanzapine
      may need to be dosed higher than 7.5 mg/day for most patients with recent-onset
      schizophrenia, and haloperidol needs to be individually titrated in the very low 
      dose range to reach optimal occupancy.

TI  - Efficacy of quetiapine and risperidone against depressive symptoms in outpatients
      with psychosis.
PG  - 1156-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with mood disorders
      is a complex challenge. Antipsychotic medications in these individuals may be
      associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), worsening of depression, and
      functional impairment. Atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine and risperidone
      are associated with a decreased incidence of adverse events such as EPS. The
      objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of
      quetiapine and risperidone for the treatment of depressive symptoms in
      outpatients with psychosis. METHOD: In this 4-month, multicenter, open-label
      trial, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio of quetiapine to
      risperidone, and both drugs were flexibly dosed. Eligible patients had psychoses 
      and demonstrated 1 of several DSM-IV diagnoses, including schizoaffective
      disorder, bipolar I disorder, major depressive disorder, delusional disorder,
      Alzheimer's dementia, schizophreniform disorder, vascular dementia, and substance
      abuse dementia. Patients were classified as mood disordered if they had bipolar
      disorder, major depressive disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy was
      assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Clinical Global
      Impressions scale. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) was used to
      assess the level of depressive symptoms. The primary tolerability assessment was 
      presence or absence of substantial EPS, defined as EPS severe enough to require
      an alteration in treatment. RESULTS: A total of 554 patients were randomly
      assigned to quetiapine and 175 to risperidone. Mean doses at 16 weeks were 318 mg
      for quetiapine and 4.4 mg for risperidone. Although both agents produced
      improvements in mean HAM-D scores, quetiapine produced a greater improvement than
      risperidone in all patients (p =.0015). Within the mood-diagnosed population,
      incidences of both substantial EPS (p =.001) and at least moderate EPS (p =.0373)
      occurred significantly less frequently among patients taking quetiapine. For
      patients with non-mood diagnoses, incidences of substantial EPS were fewer for
      patients taking quetiapine than for those taking risperidone (p =.062); however, 
      this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that
      quetiapine may be a useful agent in the management of depressive symptoms in
      patients with psychosis.

TI  - A comparison of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of divalproex sodium and
      olanzapine in the treatment of bipolar disorder.
PG  - 1148-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      divalproex and olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania associated with bipolar
      disorder. METHOD: This randomized, 12-week, double-blind, parallel-group,
      multicenter study included DSM-IV-defined bipolar disorder type I patients
      hospitalized for acute mania and randomly assigned to treatment with divalproex
      or olanzapine. After an inpatient period of up to 21 days, subjects were followed
      as outpatients. Dose adjustment was permitted during the inpatient period.
      Efficacy was assessed using change from baseline in Mania Rating Scale (MRS)
      score to day 21; other efficacy measures included the Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Clinical Global
      Impressions-Part I, Severity of Illness scale. The primary safety endpoint was
      change from baseline in weight. Other safety and tolerability endpoints included 
      spontaneous adverse event reporting and changes from baseline in laboratory
      measures and vital signs. RESULTS: 120 subjects (N = 63 divalproex, N = 57
      olanzapine) were randomly assigned to treatment. No significant differences
      between groups were found for any efficacy variable for change from baseline to
      day 21. Mean MRS score changes from baseline to day 21 were -14.8 for divalproex 
      and -17.2 for olanzapine (p =.210). A significantly (p <.05) greater proportion
      of olanzapine-treated subjects experienced somnolence, weight gain, edema,
      rhinitis, and speech disorder (slurred speech); no adverse events were
      significantly greater in the divalproex group. A number of laboratory measures
      also demonstrated significant treatment differences, but the clinical
      significance of many of these is uncertain. Mean body weight changes were
      significantly greater in the olanzapine group (+ 8.8 lb [+ 4.0 kg]) than the
      divalproex group (+ 5.5 lb [+ 2.5 kg], p <.050). One death occurred during the
      study (olanzapine group, diabetic ketoacidosis). CONCLUSION: No significant
      difference in efficacy was found between treatment groups. Divalproex was
      associated with a more favorable adverse event profile and significantly less
      weight gain than olanzapine.

TI  - The risk of diabetes during olanzapine use compared with risperidone use: a
      retrospective database analysis.
PG  - 1135-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative risk of diabetes among patients undergoing risperidone
      treatment was compared with that of patients receiving olanzapine. METHOD: A
      cohort was formed of 33,946 patients with at least 1 prescription for either
      olanzapine (N = 19,153) or risperidone (N = 14,793) between January 1, 1997, and 
      December 31, 1999, recorded in the Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec
      database. Patients were excluded if clozapine was dispensed to them during the
      study period or if they were diagnosed with diabetes before beginning
      antipsychotic therapy. New diabetes diagnoses made after the first antipsychotic 
      prescription during the period were tabulated until December 31, 1999; censoring 
      occurred at this date or at the last service date, if there was no record of
      using services during the last 6 months of follow-up. Crude hazard ratio and
      proportional hazard analyses were carried out. RESULTS: 319 patients developed
      diabetes on olanzapine treatment, and 217 developed diabetes on risperidone
      treatment; a crude hazard ratio of 1.08 (95% CI = 0.89 to 1.31, p =.43) was
      determined. When age, gender, and haloperidol use were controlled for using
      proportional hazard analysis, there was a 20% increased risk of diabetes with
      olanzapine relative to risperidone (95% CI = 0% to 43%, p =.05). Proportional
      hazard analyses adjusted for duration of olanzapine exposure indicated that the
      first 3 months of olanzapine treatment was associated with an increased risk of
      diabetes of 90% (95% CI = 40% to 157%, p <.0001), after adjusting for age,
      gender, and haloperidol use. CONCLUSION: Compared with risperidone, olanzapine
      was associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes. More studies are
      required to further investigate this association.

TI  - Clozapine treatment for suicidality in schizophrenia: International Suicide
      Prevention Trial (InterSePT).
PG  - 82-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder attempt suicide, and approximately 10% die of suicide. Study results
      suggest that clozapine therapy significantly reduces suicidal behavior in these
      patients. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, international, 2-year study
      comparing the risk for suicidal behavior in patients treated with clozapine vs
      olanzapine was conducted in 980 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder, 26.8% of whom were refractory to previous treatment, who were
      considered at high risk for suicide because of previous suicide attempts or
      current suicidal ideation. To equalize clinical contact across treatments, all
      patients were seen weekly for 6 months and then biweekly for 18 months.
      Subsequent to randomization, unmasked clinicians at each site could make any
      interventions necessary to prevent the occurrence of suicide attempts. Suicidal
      behavior was assessed at each visit. Primary end points included suicide attempts
      (including those that led to death), hospitalizations to prevent suicide, and a
      rating of "much worsening of suicidality" from baseline. Masked raters, including
      an independent suicide monitoring board, determined when end point criteria were 
      achieved. RESULTS: Suicidal behavior was significantly less in patients treated
      with clozapine vs olanzapine (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval,
      0.58-0.97; P =.03). Fewer clozapine-treated patients attempted suicide (34 vs 55;
      P =.03), required hospitalizations (82 vs 107; P =.05) or rescue interventions
      (118 vs 155; P =.01) to prevent suicide, or required concomitant treatment with
      antidepressants (221 vs 258; P =.01) or anxiolytics or soporifics (301 vs 331; P 
      =.03). Overall, few of these high-risk patients died of suicide during the study 
      (5 clozapine vs 3 olanzapine-treated patients; P =.73). CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine
      therapy demonstrated superiority to olanzapine therapy in preventing suicide
      attempts in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder at high risk
      for suicide. Use of clozapine in this population should lead to a significant
      reduction in suicidal behavior.

TI  - Olanzapine in the acute treatment of bipolar I disorder with a history of rapid
      cycling.
PG  - 155-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of patients with bipolar disorder are
      characterized by a rapidly cycling course and are particularly resistant to
      conventional treatment. METHODS: This secondary analysis, defined a priori, was
      conducted on a larger data set from patients with bipolar I disorder to determine
      the efficacy of a 3-week treatment with the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine
      (5-20 mg/day, n=19) versus placebo (n=26) in patients with >or=4 episodes in the 
      preceding year. RESULTS: Significantly fewer placebo patients completed treatment
      (34.6 vs. 73.7%, P=0.016), and more than half discontinued due to lack of
      efficacy (53.8 vs. 21.1%, P=0.035). Olanzapine reduced Young Mania Rating Scale
      (YMRS) total scores significantly more than placebo (-13.9 vs. -4.1, P=0.011).
      Clinical responses, defined as >or=50% improvement in YMRS, were achieved in 58% 
      of olanzapine patients, compared with 28% of placebo patients (P=0.066).
      Extrapyramidal symptoms were not significantly changed in either group.
      Somnolence was the most common adverse event in both groups (olanzapine: 52.6%,
      placebo: 23.1%; P=0.060). No event occurred significantly more frequently with
      olanzapine than with placebo. No patients discontinued due to an adverse event.
      LIMITATIONS: The duration of this study was limited to 3 weeks, precluding
      conclusions about long-term efficacy of olanzapine. Moreover, a sizeable placebo 
      effect was obtained, possibly masking optimal therapeutic effect. Despite these
      limitations, treatment differences in efficacy were highly significant.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that olanzapine was effective in reducing
      symptoms of mania and well tolerated in patients with bipolar I disorder with a
      rapid-cycling course.

TI  - Quetiapine is not associated with increase in prolactin secretion in contrast to 
      haloperidol.
PG  - 562-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Typical antipsychotic drugs frequently cause hyperprolactinemia and
      even galactorrhea. In addition, these side effects may result in noncompliance
      with antipsychotic treatment. Capacity to avoid hyperprolactinemia has been
      accepted as one atypical criterion. The aim of the present study was to compare
      effects of haloperidol, the most commonly used antipsychotic, and quetiapine, a
      novel antipsychotic agent used in Turkey, on serum prolactin (PRL) levels.
      METHODS: The study consisted of 35 females diagnosed with schizophrenia according
      to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4(th) ed. (DSM-IV).
      Thirty-five patients in a drug-free period for at least 2 weeks were included to 
      randomized quetiapine (n = 18) and haloperidol (n = 17) treatment group. All
      patients were assessed by Brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), Positive and
      negative syndrome scale (PANSS), and Extrapyramidal symptoms rating scale (ESRS).
      PRL levels were measured both at the beginning and at the sixth week of the
      study. RESULTS: Both treatment groups exhibited significant improvements in
      clinical signs as evaluated by BPRS and PANSS. While there was no significant
      difference in PRL level between groups at the beginning of the study, control
      prolactin (PRL) levels were significantly lower in quetiapine compared to
      haloperidol group. While no quetiapine group patients exhibited galactorrhea, we 
      observed that two patients from the haloperidol group had galactorrhea related to
      hyperprolactinemia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that quetiapine is
      not associated with increase in PRL secretion in contrast to the conventional
      antipsychotic haloperidol.

TI  - Amisulpride vs. risperidone in chronic schizophrenia: results of a 6-month
      double-blind study.
PG  - 1071-81
AB  - This multicenter, double-blind, randomized study evaluated the efficacy, safety
      and functional effects of two atypical antipsychotics, amisulpride and
      risperidone, in patients with chronic schizophrenia (DSM IV) with a recent
      worsening of symptoms. It was planned as a non-inferiority trial. 309 patients
      received amisulpride (400-1,000 mg/day) or risperidone (4-10 mg/day) for six
      months. Amisulpride was demonstrated to be not inferior to risperidone with
      respect to the decrease in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total
      score from baseline (90% 2-sided confidence interval (-5.6; 4.0)). Symptomatic
      improvement measured with the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS), the PANSS
      positive subscale, and the Bech Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale was similar in both
      groups. Amisulpride was significantly (p <.05) superior to risperidone in terms
      of response (>/=50% improvement in PANSS and BPRS total scores or "very much/much
      improved" on the Clinical Global Impression Scale) and also demonstrated better
      functional effects and subjective response. Both treatments were well tolerated
      and had a similar low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms; however, amisulpride 
      was associated with less weight gain and endocrine/sexual symptoms.

TI  - Differential effects of risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, and conventional
      antipsychotics on type 2 diabetes: findings from a large health plan database.
PG  - 920-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Case series suggest that some antipsychotics may induce or exacerbate
      type 2 diabetes. This study measured the association of antipsychotic treatments 
      with diabetes at a population level. METHOD: Claims data for psychosis patients
      (ICD-CM-9 290.xx-299.xx) within health plans encompassing 2.5 million individuals
      were analyzed. Patients reporting preexisting type 2 diabetes up to 8 months
      prior to observation were excluded. The frequency of newly reported type 2
      diabetes in untreated patients and among patients treated with antipsychotics
      from 5 categories (risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, and high-potency and
      low-potency conventionals) was compared. Logistic regression models compared the 
      odds of diabetes based on exposure to each of the antipsychotic categories.
      RESULTS: Based on 12 months of exposure, the odds of type 2 diabetes for
      risperidone-treated patients (odds ratio = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.372 to 2.070) was not
      significantly different from that for untreated patients, whereas patients
      receiving other antipsychotics had a significantly greater risk of diabetes than 
      untreated patients (p < .05): olanzapine, 3.10 (95% CI = 1.620 to 5.934);
      clozapine, 7.44 (95% CI = 0.603 to 34.751); high-potency conventionals, 2.13 (95%
      CI = 1.097 to 4.134); and low-potency conventionals, 3.46 (95% CI = 1.522 to
      7.785). Older age and greater use of non-antipsychotic psychotropic medications
      also contributed to risk of type 2 diabetes. Olanzapine also showed significantly
      higher (p < .01) odds of diabetes associated with increasing dose. CONCLUSION:
      Consistent with previously published literature, these data suggest that
      olanzapine, clozapine, and some conventional antipsychotics appear to increase
      the risk of acquiring or exacerbating type 2 diabetes and that the effect may
      vary by drug. In contrast to these agents, risperidone was not associated with an
      increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Antipsychotic combination therapy in schizophrenia. A review of efficacy and
      risks of current combinations.
PG  - 323-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on efficacy and risks of combining
      antipsychotics (atypical with atypical or conventional) and suggest a rationale
      and strategies for future clinical trials. METHOD: A computerized Medline search 
      supplemented by an examination of cross-references and reviews was performed.
      RESULTS: Empirical evidence for the efficacy of combining antipsychotics is too
      limited to draw firm conclusions. The practice of augmenting clozapine with more 
      'tightly bound' D2 receptor antagonists as exemplified by risperidone
      augmentation of clozapine has some empirical and theoretical support. The risks
      of augmentation strategies have not been studied systematically. No study has
      examined the economic impact of combination treatment. CONCLUSION: Further trials
      of antipsychotic combination therapies are needed before this currently
      unsupported practice can be recommended. Rationales for combination treatment
      include a broadening of the range of receptor activity or an increase in D2
      receptor occupancy with certain atypical agents. Trial methodology needs to take 
      into account subject characteristics, duration of treatment, optimization of
      monotherapy comparators, and appropriate outcome measures.

TI  - Extrapyramidal symptom profiles in Japanese patients with schizophrenia treated
      with olanzapine or haloperidol.
PG  - 227-38
AB  - Previous clinical trials have clearly shown the superiority of olanzapine to
      haloperidol in the improvement of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in schizophrenic 
      patients. The primary purpose of this study was to compare EPS profiles in
      Japanese schizophrenic patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic,
      olanzapine, or a typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, as measured by the
      Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). The DIEPSS, which consists
      of eight individual parameters and one global assessment (overall severity), was 
      used to evaluate 182 patients enrolled in this 8-week study. The primary safety
      analysis was maximum change (that could be either a decrease or increase) from
      baseline in DIEPSS total score. Secondary analyses included change from baseline 
      to maximum in DIEPSS total score, change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF) in
      DIEPSS total score, and the rank sum of the maximum change (that could be either 
      a decrease or increase) from baseline in the DIEPSS individual items. Incidence
      of treatment-emergent EPS adverse events using the DIEPSS scale was also
      analyzed. The olanzapine group showed statistically significant superiority to
      the haloperidol group on the primary analysis (p<0.001). Secondary analyses also 
      demonstrated olanzapine's superiority in DIEPSS total, parkinsonism, akathisia
      and overall severity scores (all p< or =0.014). Categorical analysis of
      treatment-emergent akathisia and parkinsonism syndromes at endpoint showed
      improvement in the olanzapine group but worsening in the haloperidol group. The
      results from this study suggest that olanzapine, as in Caucasian populations, is 
      a safe treatment in Japanese patients chronically ill with schizophrenia.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol in the treatment of acute mania: clinical outcomes,
      health-related quality of life and work status.
PG  - 227-37
AB  - We aimed to compare clinical outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and
      work status associated with olanzapine and haloperidol treatment in patients with
      bipolar disorder. This double-blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing
      flexible dosing of olanzapine (5-20 mg/day, n = 234) to haloperidol (3-15 mg/day,
      n = 219), consisted of a 6-week acute phase, followed by a 6-week continuation
      phase. Symptomatic remission rates were similar for olanzapine- and
      haloperidol-treated patients at weeks 6 and 12. At week 6, significant changes in
      five dimensions of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey
      (SF-36) [general health (P = 0.010), physical functioning (P < 0.001), role
      limitations due to physical problems (P < 0.001), social functioning (P < 0.05)
      and vitality (P < 0.01)] and the SF-36 physical components summary score were
      found in favour of olanzapine compared to haloperidol. At week 12, olanzapine
      treatment maintained the significantly favourable HRQOL changes. At the end of
      week 12, patients on olanzapine showed significantly greater improvement than
      haloperidol in work activities impairment and household activities impairment
      scores on the Streamlined Longitudinal Interview Clinical Evaluation from the
      Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (SLICE/LIFE) activities impairment
      scores. Subgroup analyses revealed that olanzapine treatment significantly
      increased a proportion of employed patients and their weekly paid working hours. 
      In conclusion, compared to haloperidol, olanzapine treatment was comparably
      effective in the remission of bipolar mania and significantly improved HRQOL and 
      work status in patients with bipolar I disorder.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone for the treatment of
      disruptive behaviors in children with subaverage intelligence.
PG  - 1337-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The short-term efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of 
      disruptive behaviors was examined in a well-characterized cohort of children with
      subaverage intelligence. METHOD: In this 6-week, multicenter, double-blind,
      parallel-group study of 118 children (aged 5-12 years) with severely disruptive
      behaviors and subaverage intelligence (IQ between 36 and 84, inclusive), the
      subjects received 0.02-0.06 mg/kg per day of risperidone oral solution or
      placebo. The a priori primary efficacy measure was the change in score from
      baseline to endpoint on the conduct problem subscale of the Nisonger Child
      Behavior Rating Form. RESULTS: The risperidone group showed significantly greater
      improvement than did the placebo group on the conduct problem subscale of the
      Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form from week 1 through endpoint (change in score
      of -15.2 and -6.2, respectively). Risperidone was also associated with
      significantly greater improvement than placebo on all other Nisonger Child
      Behavior Rating Form subscales at endpoint, as well as on the Aberrant Behavior
      Checklist subscales for irritability, lethargy/social withdrawal, and
      hyperactivity; the Behavior Problems Inventory aggressive/destructive behavior
      subscale; a visual analogue scale of the most troublesome symptom; and the
      Clinical Global Impression change score. The most common adverse effects reported
      during risperidone treatment were headache and somnolence. The extrapyramidal
      symptom profile of risperidone was comparable to that of placebo. Mean weight
      increases of 2.2 kg. and 0.9 kg occurred in the risperidone and placebo groups,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone was effective and well tolerated for the
      treatment of severely disruptive behaviors in children with subaverage IQ.

TI  - Weight and blood pressure change during clozapine treatment.
PG  - 202-6
AB  - We examined whether clozapine-related weight gain is associated with an increase 
      in mean arterial blood pressure. Weight gain and mean arterial blood pressure
      changes were assessed in 61 outpatients with schizophrenia who were randomly
      assigned to either clozapine or haloperidol in a 10-week parallel group,
      double-blind study and in 55 patients who chose to continue to receive clozapine 
      in a subsequent 1-year open-label prospective study. Clozapine treatment was
      associated with significant weight gain in the double blind and open-label
      trials. Haloperidol treatment was not associated with significant weight gain.
      Neither clozapine nor haloperidol treatment were associated with significant
      changes in mean arterial blood pressure. There were no significant correlations
      between weight gain and mean arterial blood pressure change with either
      medication. Although clozapine treatment is associated with weight gain, the
      correlation between this weight gain and increases in arterial blood pressure
      during the first year of treatment appears to be low.

TI  - Risperidone in children with autism and serious behavioral problems.
PG  - 314-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical antipsychotic agents, which block postsynaptic dopamine and 
      serotonin receptors, have advantages over traditional antipsychotic medications
      in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and may be beneficial in children
      with autistic disorder who have serious behavioral disturbances. However, data on
      the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents in children are limited.
      METHODS: We conducted a multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of risperidone 
      as compared with placebo for the treatment of autistic disorder accompanied by
      severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children 5 to 17 years
      old. The primary outcome measures were the score on the Irritability subscale of 
      the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the rating on the Clinical Global Impressions
      - Improvement (CGI-I) scale at eight weeks. RESULTS: A total of 101 children (82 
      boys and 19 girls; mean [+/-SD] age, 8.8+/-2.7 years) were randomly assigned to
      receive risperidone (49 children) or placebo (52). Treatment with risperidone for
      eight weeks (dose range, 0.5 to 3.5 mg per day) resulted in a 56.9 percent
      reduction in the Irritability score, as compared with a 14.1 percent decrease in 
      the placebo group (P<0.001). The rate of a positive response, defined as at least
      a 25 percent decrease in the Irritability score and a rating of much improved or 
      very much improved on the CGI-I scale, was 69 percent in the risperidone group
      (34 of 49 children had a positive response) and 12 percent in the placebo group
      (6 of 52, P<0.001). Risperidone therapy was associated with an average weight
      gain of 2.7+/-2.9 kg, as compared with 0.8+/-2.2 kg with placebo (P<0.001).
      Increased appetite, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, and drooling were more common
      in the risperidone group than in the placebo group (P<0.05 for each comparison). 
      In two thirds of the children with a positive response to risperidone at eight
      weeks (23 of 34), the benefit was maintained at six months. CONCLUSIONS:
      Risperidone was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of tantrums,
      aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children with autistic disorder. The
      short period of this trial limits inferences about adverse effects such as
      tardive dyskinesia.

TI  - Economic, clinical, and quality-of-life outcomes associated with olanzapine
      treatment in mania. Results from a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 109-18
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to determine the economic,
      clinical, and quality-of-life outcomes associated with olanzapine treatment in
      patients diagnosed with mania. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar I
      disorder with manic or mixed episodes were enrolled in a randomized controlled
      trial. The study design comprised a 3-week acute phase followed by a 49-week open
      label extension. In the open label extension, the use of lithium and fluoxetine
      was permitted for patients who experienced breakthrough symptoms. Clinical,
      economic, and quality-of-life outcomes of treatment were assessed. RESULTS:
      During the acute phase, olanzapine patients experienced a statistically
      significant greater mean improvement from baseline on the Y-MRS total score
      compared to the placebo patients. In the open label extension, patients
      experienced a statistically significant mean change of 11.8 units on the Y-MRS
      from the end of the acute phase. When compared to costs incurred in the previous 
      12 months of therapy, patients experienced savings of almost $900 per month
      during the 49 weeks of olanzapine therapy. These cost savings were largely driven
      by reductions in in-patient costs during the open label extension. Health-related
      quality of life improvements measured by the SF-36 were seen on several
      dimensions both in the 3-week acute phase as well as in the 49-week open label
      extension. CONCLUSION: From a clinical, economic, and quality-of-life outcomes
      standpoint, olanzapine had a significant impact in the treatment of mania, and
      could be considered a cost-effective treatment option for use in this population 
      if these findings are extrapolated to non-clinical trial populations.

TI  - A 28-week comparison of ziprasidone and haloperidol in outpatients with stable
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 516-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic with a unique pharmacologic
      profile. This study compared ziprasidone with the conventional antipsychotic
      haloperidol in outpatients with stable schizophrenia. METHOD: Three hundred one
      outpatients with stable chronic or subchronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were
      randomized and participated in this double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group
      clinical study comparing flexible-dose oral ziprasidone, 80-160 mg/day (N = 148),
      with haloperidol, 5-15 mg/day (N = 153), over 28 weeks. Patients were assessed
      using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global
      Impressions-Severity of Illness scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale, the Simpson-Angus Scale, the Barnes Akathisia Scale, and the Abnormal
      Involuntary Movement Scale. RESULTS: Modal doses at endpoint were 80 mg/day for
      ziprasidone and 5 mg/day for haloperidol. Improvements in all mean efficacy
      variables with both ziprasidone and haloperidol were observed. Significantly more
      patients were categorized as negative symptom responders (> or = 20% reduction in
      PANSS negative subscale score) in the ziprasidone group (48%) compared with the
      haloperidol group (33%) (p < .05). Ziprasidone had clear advantages over
      haloperidol in all evaluations of movement disorders. Changes in body weight were
      negligible with both treatments. No pattern of laboratory or cardiovascular
      changes was observed. CONCLUSION: Ziprasidone and haloperidol were both effective
      in reducing overall psychopathology; ziprasidone demonstrated effective treatment
      of negative symptoms and was better tolerated than haloperidol. Ziprasidone
      appears to offer an effective alternative to haloperidol in the long-term
      treatment of stable outpatients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Newer atypical antipsychotic medication in comparison to clozapine: a systematic 
      review of randomized trials.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of newer atypical
      antipsychotic drugs in comparison to clozapine for schizophrenia. Publications in
      all languages were searched from all relevant databases and all randomized
      controlled trials comparing clozapine with newer atypical drugs were included.
      The review and meta-analysis includes eight studies, most of them short in
      duration. Newer atypical drugs were broadly similar to clozapine when improvement
      was measured using a psychosis symptom rating scale or a global index. There was 
      a trend for clozapine to be more effective than the others for positive symptoms,
      and less effective for the negative symptoms. The adverse effect profile of
      clozapine and newer atypical drugs was dissimilar: while clozapine produced more 
      fatigue, hypersalivation, and orthostatic dizziness, new atypical drugs, with the
      exception of olanzapine, produced more extrapyramidal symptoms. As these results 
      were obtained from few studies and a relatively small amount of patients, the
      equal effectiveness and tolerability of new atypical drugs in comparison with
      clozapine is not yet demonstrated. More trials of sufficient power, with longer
      duration, and measuring clinically important outcomes are urgently needed.

TI  - The neurocognitive effects of low-dose haloperidol: a two-year comparison with
      risperidone.
PG  - 972-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive deficits are core features of schizophrenia that are
      linked to functional outcome for the disorder. Recent studies and reviews have
      concluded that newer antipsychotic medications are better for neurocognitive
      deficits than conventional antipsychotic medications; however, one difficulty in 
      interpreting this literature is that the comparisons have mainly been with high
      doses of conventional medications. This study examined the neurocognitive effects
      of low-dose haloperidol compared with risperidone over a 2-year period. METHODS: 
      Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to medication (starting at 6 mg of each
      medication) and administered neurocognitive batteries six times over the course
      of follow-up. At 6 months, the mean dose of haloperidol was 5.0 mg, and the mean 
      dose of risperidone was 6.0 mg. Neurocognitive data were reduced into cluster
      scores and a global summary score. RESULTS: We found no significant overall
      differences in treatment effects on the cluster scores or the global score. The
      global score revealed a significant group by time interaction, reflecting the
      fact that the haloperidol group tended to improve initially and then stay stable,
      whereas the risperidone group improved more gradually over the follow-up period. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study did not provide support for neurocognitive advantages of 
      a newer antipsychotic medication over a low-dose conventional medication. We
      speculate that conventional medications may have neurocognitive benefits at low
      doses that are neutralized or reversed at higher doses.

TI  - Neurocognitive effects of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol in 
      patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 1018-28
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Newer antipsychotic drugs have shown promise in ameliorating
      neurocognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia, but few studies have
      compared newer antipsychotic drugs with both clozapine and conventional agents,
      particularly in patients who have had suboptimal response to prior treatments.
      METHOD: The authors examined the effects of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone,
      and haloperidol on 16 measures of neurocognitive functioning in a double-blind,
      14-week trial involving 101 patients. A global score was computed along with
      scores in four neurocognitive domains: memory, attention, motor function, and
      general executive and perceptual organization. RESULTS: Global neurocognitive
      function improved with olanzapine and risperidone treatment, and these
      improvements were superior to those seen with haloperidol. Patients treated with 
      olanzapine exhibited improvement in the general and attention domains but not
      more than that observed with other treatments. Patients treated with risperidone 
      exhibited improvement in memory that was superior to that of both clozapine and
      haloperidol. Clozapine yielded improvement in motor function but not more than in
      other groups. Average effect sizes for change were in the small to medium range. 
      More than half of the patients treated with olanzapine and risperidone
      experienced "clinically significant" improvement (changes in score of at least
      one-half standard deviation relative to baseline). These findings did not appear 
      to be mediated by changes in symptoms, side effects, or blood levels of
      medications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of suboptimal response to
      conventional treatments may show cognitive benefits from newer antipsychotic
      drugs, and there may be differences between atypical antipsychotic drugs in their
      patterns of cognitive effects.

TI  - Olanzapine versus divalproex in the treatment of acute mania.
PG  - 1011-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of olanzapine and divalproex for the treatment of mania
      were compared in a large randomized clinical trial. METHOD: A 3-week, randomized,
      double-blind trial compared flexibly dosed olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) to divalproex
      (500-2500 mg/day in divided doses) for the treatment of patients hospitalized for
      acute bipolar manic or mixed episodes. The Young Mania Rating Scale and the
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were used to quantify manic and depressive
      symptoms, respectively. Safety was assessed with several measures. RESULTS: The
      protocol defined baseline-to-endpoint improvement in the mean total score on the 
      Young Mania Rating Scale as the primary outcome variable. The mean Young Mania
      Rating Scale score decreased by 13.4 for patients treated with olanzapine (N=125)
      and 10.4 for those treated with divalproex (N=123). A priori categorizations
      defined response and remission rates: 54.4% of olanzapine-treated patients
      responded (> or = 50% reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale score), compared to
      42.3% of divalproex-treated patients; 47.2% of olanzapine-treated patients had
      remission of mania symptoms (endpoint Young Mania Rating Scale < or = 12),
      compared to 34.1% of divalproex-treated patients. The decrease in Hamilton
      depression scale score was similar in the two treatment groups. Completion rates 
      for the 3-week study were similar in both groups. The most common
      treatment-emergent adverse events (incidence >10%) occurring more frequently
      during treatment with olanzapine were dry mouth, increased appetite, and
      somnolence. For divalproex, nausea was more frequently observed. The average
      weight gain with olanzapine treatment was 2.5 kg, compared to 0.9 kg with
      divalproex treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The olanzapine treatment group had
      significantly greater mean improvement of mania ratings and a significantly
      greater proportion of patients achieving protocol-defined remission, compared
      with the divalproex treatment group. Significantly more weight gain and cases of 
      dry mouth, increased appetite, and somnolence were reported with olanzapine,
      while more cases of nausea were reported with divalproex.

TI  - Sex differences in clinical response to olanzapine compared with haloperidol.
PG  - 27-37
AB  - There is current disagreement over whether men and women respond differently to
      typical or atypical antipsychotic medications. This study reanalyzed a large
      international clinical trial of olanzapine (Olz) compared with haloperidol (Hal) 
      to test for sex differences in treatment response, controlling for illness
      chronicity and menopausal status. We hypothesized that women would show a greater
      response to either medication than men, particularly among first admission,
      premenopausal women. DSM-III-R schizophrenia inpatients (700 women and 1295 men) 
      were randomly assigned to a 6-week trial of Olz vs. Hal. Longitudinal random
      effect models were used to test for interactions of sex with medication,
      chronicity and menopausal status on treatment response. Findings showed that
      women on olanzapine had a greater drop in overall symptomatology by week 4 than
      any other group, and their level of symptomatology remained lower throughout the 
      6-week trial. The sex differences in treatment response in olanzapine compared
      with haloperidol were, in part, dependent on chronicity and, in women, menopausal
      status. That is, first episode women on haloperidol exhibited an increase in
      symptomatology over the 6-week trial compared to their male counterparts, while
      multiply hospitalized women had a better treatment response on haloperidol than
      their male counterparts. Women on olanzapine had a significantly better treatment
      response than men, regardless of chronicity. Finally, premenopausal women had a
      significantly better treatment response than postmenopausal women, regardless of 
      treatment and chronicity.

TI  - Clozapine use and risk of diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 236-43
AB  - Recent reports have raised the concern that clozapine increases the risk for
      diabetes mellitus. Accurate pharmacoepidemiologic data on whether such a hazard
      exists and its magnitude are needed to enable clinicians and patients to make
      proper treatment decisions about clozapine. The authors performed a case-control 
      study involving 7,227 cases of newly treated diabetes and 6,780 controls, all
      with psychiatric disorders. Cases and controls were older than 20 years and
      enrolled in government-sponsored drug benefit programs in New Jersey. The authors
      measured the use of clozapine or other antipsychotic medications and additional
      covariates. They developed logistic regression models adjusted for demographic,
      clinical, and health care use characteristics to identify whether clozapine users
      were at increased risk to begin treatment for diabetes. Clozapine use was not
      significantly associated with developing diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [OR],
      0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.31). There was no suggestion of
      relationships between larger dosages or longer durations of clozapine use and
      increasing risks of diabetes. On the other hand, nonclozapine antipsychotic
      medication use was associated with a modest but significantly increased risk of
      developing diabetes (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.22). Among individual
      nonclozapine antipsychotics, significantly elevated risks were observed for two
      phenothiazine agents: chlorpromazine (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.56) and
      perphenazine (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11- 1.62). In contrast to earlier
      reports, these results provide some reassurance that clozapine does not increase 
      the risk of developing diabetes. Additional data from pharmacoepidemiologic
      studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to exclude the possibility of
      residual confounding and ensure the appropriate use of this agent.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol in schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.
PG  - 133-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present analysis was performed on data from a subsample of
      patients with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, who participated in a
      multicenter, double-blind study comparing olanzapine to haloperidol. METHODS:
      Patients with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, characterized as currently
      manic, mixed, depressed, or euthymic, were assessed weekly for 6 weeks during
      treatment with either olanzapine or haloperidol. Manic symptoms were measured
      using the sum of six items of the BPRS, and depressive symptoms were assessed
      using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. In addition, cognitive
      functioning was measured using the sum of seven items from the PANSS. Repeated
      measures analyses were performed using random coefficients regression of the
      serial measurement of manic, cognitive, and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: A
      significant treatment difference was detected overall, indicating that olanzapine
      was significantly more effective than haloperidol in reducing symptoms of
      depression and improving patients' cognitive symptoms. The superiority of
      olanzapine over haloperidol in the reduction of manic symptoms did not reach
      statistical significance (P=.052). The greatest improvement in both manic and
      cognitive symptoms was seen in the olanzapine-treated 'currently manic' subgroup,
      and least improvement in the haloperidol-treated 'euthymic' subgroup. Depressive 
      symptoms were most improved in the olanzapine-treated 'depressed' subgroup, and
      least improved in the corresponding haloperidol subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
      olanzapine was superior to haloperidol with respect to thymoleptic effects in
      patients with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.

TI  - Risperidone safety and efficacy in the treatment of bipolar and schizoaffective
      disorders: results from a 6-month, multicenter, open study.
PG  - 818-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of
      risperidone in bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. METHOD: 541 patients
      entered this open, multicenter, 6-month study. Patients were entered provided
      that they fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder or schizoaffective
      disorder, bipolar type, during a manic, hypomanic, mixed, or depressive episode. 
      Risperidone was added to any previous mood-stabilizing medication that the
      patients were taking. Efficacy was assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale
      (YMRS), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI).
      Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed using the UKU Side Effect Rating
      Scale. RESULTS: 430 patients completed the study. Addition of risperidone
      produced highly significant improvements (p < .0001) on the YMRS and HAM-D at
      both 6 weeks and 6 months and on the CGI and the scales of the PANSS at both 4
      weeks and 6 months. There was a significant reduction in UKU total and subscale
      scores at 6 months. The mean dose of risperidone was 3.9 mg/day. There was no
      single case of new-emergent tardive dyskinesia, and there was a very low
      incidence of exacerbation of mania within the first 6 weeks (2%). Adverse events 
      were few and mostly mild. the most frequent being EPS and weight gain.
      CONCLUSION: This large study provides additional evidence that risperidone is
      effective and well tolerated when combined with mood stabilizers in the treatment
      of bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. Previous concerns
      about exacerbation of manic symptoms were not confirmed.

TI  - Comparison of risperidone with olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia and
      psychosis.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of risperidone and olanzapine on
      cognition in elderly patients with dementia and psychosis, and to compare the
      side effects of these drugs. DESIGN: Single-blind, multicenter, observational
      study. SETTING: Four rural nursing care facilities. PATIENTS: Nineteen elderly
      patients with dementia and psychosis. INTERVENTION: Eleven patients were treated 
      with risperidone, eight with olanzapine. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Rating
      assessments were completed at baseline, 1 month, and 2 months. Simple paired and 
      unpaired t tests determined between- and within-group differences. Social
      functioning, including activities of daily living, improved over baseline in both
      groups (p=0.03). Cognition declined significantly (p<0.05) in the risperidone
      group; comparatively more side effects occurred and blood pressure decreased
      (p<0.05) in the olanzapine group. When compared with each group cross-sectionally
      at baseline and end point, however, the two groups did not differ significantly. 
      CONCLUSION: Improvements in social functioning in all 19 patients suggest that
      both risperidone and olanzapine may help improve functioning in elderly patients 
      with dementia and psychosis. Cognitive and side effect profiles of these drugs
      may differ substantially. Further study is needed to determine patient
      subpopulations who may be able to tolerate one drug over another.

TI  - Efficacy of olanzapine in combination with valproate or lithium in the treatment 
      of mania in patients partially nonresponsive to valproate or lithium monotherapy.
PG  - 62-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 6-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was
      conducted to determine the efficacy of combined therapy with olanzapine and
      either valproate or lithium compared with valproate or lithium alone in treating 
      acute manic or mixed bipolar episodes. METHODS: The primary objective was to
      evaluate the efficacy of olanzapine (5-20 mg/d) vs placebo when added to ongoing 
      mood-stabilizer therapy as measured by reductions in Young Mania Rating Scale
      (YMRS) scores. Patients with bipolar disorder (n = 344), manic or mixed episode, 
      who were inadequately responsive to more than 2 weeks of lithium or valproate
      therapy, were randomized to receive cotherapy (olanzapine + mood-stabilizer) or
      monotherapy (placebo + mood-stabilizer). RESULTS: Olanzapine cotherapy improved
      patients' YMRS total scores significantly more than monotherapy (-13.11 vs -9.10;
      P = .003). Clinical response rates (> or = 50% improvement on YMRS) were
      significantly higher with cotherapy (67.7% vs 44.7%; P< .001). Olanzapine
      cotherapy improved 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21) total
      scores significantly more than monotherapy (4.98 vs 0.89 points; P< .001). In
      patients with mixed-episodes with moderate to severe depressive symptoms (DSM-IV 
      mixed episode; HAMD-21 score of > or = 20 at baseline), olanzapine cotherapy
      improved HAMD-21 scores by 10.31 points compared with 1.57 for monotherapy (P<
      .001). Extrapyramidal symptoms (Simpson-Angus Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale,
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale) were not significantly changed from baseline
      to end point in either treatment group. Treatment-emergent symptoms that were
      significantly higher for the olanzapine cotherapy group included somnolence, dry 
      mouth, weight gain, increased appetite, tremor, and slurred speech. CONCLUSION:
      Compared with the use of valproate or lithium alone, the addition of olanzapine
      provided superior efficacy in the treatment of manic and mixed bipolar episodes.

TI  - A comparison of risperidone and haloperidol for the prevention of relapse in
      patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 16-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of relapse is a major goal of maintenance treatment in
      patients with psychotic disorders. We performed a long-term comparison of a
      newer, atypical antipsychotic drug, risperidone, and an older, conventional
      neuroleptic drug, haloperidol, in terms of the rate of relapse in patients with
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. METHODS: In a double-blind,
      prospective study at 40 sites, we randomly assigned adult outpatients in stable
      condition with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to receive
      treatment with flexible doses of either risperidone or haloperidol for a minimum 
      of one year. RESULTS: Of the 397 patients who underwent randomization, data from 
      2 were excluded because they did not receive study medication; data from all 30
      patients from one site were excluded by the sponsor, the Janssen Research
      Foundation, because of concern about the integrity of the data. The median
      duration of treatment was 364 days in the risperidone group and 238 days in the
      haloperidol group (P=0.02). Of the 177 patients assigned to risperidone and the
      188 assigned to haloperidol who remained in the analysis, 44.1 percent and 52.7
      percent, respectively, discontinued treatment for reasons other than relapse. The
      Kaplan-Meier estimate of the risk of relapse at the end of the study was 34
      percent for the risperidone group and 60 percent for the haloperidol group
      (P<0.001); the risk ratio for relapse with haloperidol, from the Cox model, was
      1.93 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.33 to 2.80; P<0.001). Early
      discontinuation of treatment for any reason was more frequent among
      haloperidol-treated patients (risk ratio, 1.52; 95 percent confidence interval,
      1.18 to 1.96). Patients in the risperidone group had greater reductions in the
      mean severity of both psychotic symptoms and extrapyramidal side effects than
      those in the haloperidol group. CONCLUSIONS: Adult outpatients with clinically
      stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder have a lower risk of relapse if 
      they are treated with risperidone than if they are treated with haloperidol.

TI  - Olanzapine treatment for patients with schizophrenia and substance abuse.
PG  - 217-21
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine
      in patients with schizophrenia and comorbid substance abuse disorders. Thirty
      patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as
      well as criteria for substance abuse or substance dependence, were treated in a
      12-month prospective, open-label trial of olanzapine. Patients were evaluated
      with multiple efficacy and safety measures at baseline and then monthly
      thereafter. Statistically significant improvement was noted in psychopathology,
      levels of hope, and safety measures. Seventy percent (n = 21) of the patients
      achieved early full substance abuse remission at the end of the study period,
      while 30% (n = 9) achieved early partial substance abuse remission. Our results
      indicate that olanzapine treatment improved psychopathology, increased
      hopefulness, and reduced antipsychotic-associated side effects. The benefits
      observed with olanzapine treatment may contribute to the patients' substance
      abuse remission.

TI  - A comparison of the relative safety, efficacy, and tolerability of quetiapine and
      risperidone in outpatients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders: the 
      quetiapine experience with safety and tolerability (QUEST) study.
PG  - 1839-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: The few published direct comparative studies of the tolerability and 
      efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents were performed in relatively
      homogeneous populations that may not be typical of patients seen in clinical
      practice. OBJECTIVE: The Quetiapine Experience with Safety and Tolerability
      (QUEST) study compared the relative safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      quetiapine and risperidone in outpatients with a broad range of psychotic
      symptoms. METHODS: This was a multicenter, 4-month, open-label, randomized
      clinical trial. Patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive quetiapine or 
      risperidone. Doses were adjusted to maximize efficacy and to minimize adverse
      events. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed with an EPS checklist;
      adverse events were recorded. Efficacy was assessed using the Clinical Global
      Impression (CGI) scale, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). RESULTS: A total of 728 patients were
      randomized, 553 to quetiapine and 175 to risperidone. Mean prescribed doses over 
      the study period were 253.9 mg/d quetiapine and 4.4 mg/d risperidone. At the end 
      of 4 months, EPS declined in both treatment groups, but quetiapine-treated
      patients were significantly less likely to require dose adjustment or concurrent 
      anti-EPS medication (P < 0.001). The most common adverse events in the quetiapine
      and risperidone groups were somnolence (31.3% and 15.4%, respectively), dry mouth
      (14.5% and 6.9%), and dizziness (12.7% and 6.9%). Overall, tolerance to side
      effects with the 2 drugs, measured by dropout rates, was comparable. At each
      visit, a higher percentage of quetiapine-treated patients showed improvement on
      the CGI scale, but there were no significant between-group differences on the
      PANSS. At end point, quetiapine-treated patients had significantly lower HAM-D
      scores (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that
      quetiapine is as effective as risperidone for the treatment of psychotic
      symptoms, is more effective for depressive symptoms, may have a more favorable
      EPS profile, and has comparable overall tolerability.

TI  - Clozapine use in patients with schizophrenia and the risk of diabetes,
      hyperlipidemia, and hypertension: a claims-based approach.
PG  - 1172-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous case reports have linked clozapine to the development of
      diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia in patients with schizophrenia. However,
      investigators have been unable to clearly demonstrate this association when
      compared with a control group receiving conventional antipsychotics. METHODS:
      Medical and pharmacy claims from the Iowa Medicaid program were used to compare
      incidence rates for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension in 552 patients
      receiving clozapine and 2461 patients receiving conventional antipsychotics (eg, 
      haloperidol, chlorpromazine hydrochloride), with the use of a retrospective
      cohort design. Logistic regression was used to compare incidence rates adjusting 
      for age, sex, and duration of available follow-up. RESULTS: No significant
      differences in overall incidence rates for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or
      hypertension were observed in patients receiving clozapine vs conventional
      antipsychotics. However, among younger patients (aged 20-34 years), clozapine
      administration was associated with a significantly increased relative risk of
      diabetes (2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.4]) and hyperlipidemia (2.4 [95%
      confidence interval, 1.1-5.2]), but not hypertension (0.9 [95% confidence
      interval, 0.4-2.0]). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that clozapine may not be an
      independent cause of diabetes or hyperlipidemia, but instead acts as an effect
      modifier in susceptible populations by increasing weight or affecting insulin
      secretion and resistance. This finding requires confirmation in other settings
      and patient populations and with the other atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, 
      olanzapine, and quetiapine fumarate). The potential long-term medical and
      economic implications of the early induction of diabetes and hyperlipidemia in
      patients with schizophrenia warrant further study.

TI  - A double-blind randomised comparison of risperidone and haloperidol in the
      treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms in Chinese dementia patients.
PG  - 1156-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) are common during the
      course of dementia and present severe problems to patients and their caregivers. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of haloperidol and
      risperidone in treating BPSD in Chinese dementia patients. METHODS: A 12-week
      double-blind randomised comparison of haloperidol and risperidone treatments was 
      conducted in 58 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer's type or
      vascular dementia. They were randomly assigned to receive flexible doses (0.5 to 
      2 mg/day) of haloperidol or risperidone. Clinical response was evaluated using
      the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioral Pathology in
      Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), Simpson-Angus Scale, Functional
      Assessment Staging and Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination.
      RESULTS: The mean doses at the last week were 0.90 mg/day of haloperidol and 0.85
      mg/day of risperidone. Both haloperidol and risperidone significantly reduced the
      severity of BPSD (scores on CMAI and BEHAVE-AD), with no significant
      between-group differences. Haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on
      Simpson-Angus scale while there was no significant change in this measure in
      risperidone-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose haloperidol and risperidone
      were well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity and frequency 
      of behavioural symptoms in subjects with dementia. Risperidone may have a more
      favourable risk-benefit profile in view of its lower propensity to induce
      extrapyramidal symptoms.

TI  - Does cognitive function improve with quetiapine in comparison to haloperidol?
PG  - 239-48
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that schizophrenia patients taking atypical
      antipsychotic medications may perform better on some tests of cognitive function 
      than those treated with older antipsychotics. The current study compared the
      effects of quetiapine and haloperidol on measures of executive function, memory
      and attention. Subjects were 58 stable outpatients with schizophrenia (DSM III-R)
      who received a battery of cognitive tests as part of a randomized, double-blind, 
      multi-site clinical efficacy study conducted by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals.
      Cognitive assessments were conducted prior to randomization when patients were
      receiving < or =30 mg haloperidol or equivalent (mean: 9.2mg/day haloperidol
      equivalents), and again after 24 weeks of fixed-dose treatment with either
      quetiapine 600 or 300 mg/day or haloperidol 12 mg/day. Analyses of covariance
      with planned comparisons were used to compare scores on cognitive measures at the
      end of 24 weeks by treatment group with baseline cognitive function scores used
      as covariates. Patients receiving quetiapine 600 mg/day improved to a greater
      extent than patients receiving haloperidol on overall cognitive function
      (p<0.02). Specific differences were found for executive function (Verbal Fluency 
      Test, p<0.04), attention (Stroop Color Word Test, p<.03) and verbal memory
      (Paragraph Recall Test, p<0.02). Treatment group differences were not solely due 
      to benztropine use, medication side effects, or changes in symptomatology.
      Treatment with quetiapine at higher doses (600 mg/day) relative to haloperidol
      appears to have a positive impact on important domains of cognitive performance
      that have been found to predict role function and community outcomes in patients 
      with schizophrenia.

TI  - Affective reactivity of language and right-ear advantage in schizophrenia.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - A subset of schizophrenic patients has demonstrated increased language
      dysfunction in affectively stressful, compared to non-stressful conditions.
      Affective reactivity of right-ear advantage has been demonstrated in studies of
      dichotic listening in schizophrenia. The present study assessed whether
      participants who showed affective reactivity of speech were also those who showed
      affective reactivity of right-ear advantage. Data from 18 schizophrenic
      outpatients were analyzed. Affective reactivity of language was associated with
      affective reactivity of right-ear advantage. Findings should be regarded as
      preliminary due to the small sample size; however, they may potentially
      contribute to construct the validity of affective reactivity as a process
      discriminator in schizophrenia.

TI  - Clozapine and haloperidol in moderately refractory schizophrenia: a 6-month
      randomized and double-blind comparison.
PG  - 965-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the demonstrated efficacy of clozapine in severely refractory
      schizophrenia, questions remain regarding its efficacy for primary negative
      symptoms, comparison with a moderate dose of a first-generation antipsychotic,
      and adverse effects during a longer-term trial. This study examined its efficacy 
      in partially responsive, community-based patients, compared clozapine with
      moderate-dose haloperidol, and extended treatment to 6 months. METHODS:
      Randomized, double-blind, 29-week trial comparing clozapine (n = 37) with
      haloperidol (n = 34). Subjects with schizophrenia who were being treated in
      community settings at 3 collaborating clinical facilities were enrolled. RESULTS:
      Subjects treated with haloperidol were significantly more likely to discontinue
      treatment for lack of efficacy (51%) than were those treated with clozapine
      (12%). A higher proportion of clozapine-treated subjects met an a priori
      criterion of improvement (57%) compared with haloperidol-treated subjects (25%). 
      Significantly greater improvement was seen in symptoms of psychosis,
      hostile-suspiciousness, anxiety-depression, thought disturbance, and total score 
      measured on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. No differences were detected in
      negative symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale or the Schedule for
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Subjects treated with clozapine experienced more
      excess salivation, dizziness, and sweating and less dry mouth and decreased
      appetite than those treated with haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a
      first-generation antipsychotic given in a moderate dose, clozapine offers
      substantial clinical benefits to treatment-refractory subjects who can be treated
      in the community. Advantages are seen in a broad range of symptoms but do not
      extend to negative symptoms.

TI  - Olanzapine as long-term adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant bipolar
      disorder.
PG  - 469-73
AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the long-term effectiveness of olanzapine
      as adjunctive therapy in patients with bipolar disorder who exhibited an
      inadequate response to mood stabilizers. Twenty-three Research Diagnostic
      Criteria (RDC) patients with bipolar I and II were assessed by means of the
      Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and entered if they gave their
      consent to participate. All of them had experienced frequent relapses, residual
      subsyndromal symptoms, and inadequate responses to other drugs, such as lithium, 
      valproate, or carbamazepine. While maintaining other drugs, they all received
      open-label, increasing doses of olanzapine, until achieving clinical response.
      Other drugs were maintained. The patients were assessed several consecutive times
      from baseline to the endpoint with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale
      for use in bipolar illness. Records of recurrences, hospitalizations, and side
      effects were also collected. The last-observation-carried-forward analysis showed
      that there was a significant reduction of CGI scores after the introduction of
      olanzapine, either in manic symptoms (p = 0.0015), depressive symptoms (p =
      0.0063), or global symptoms (p = 0.0003). The most frequent adverse events were
      somnolence (17%) and weight gain (13%). The mean dose of olanzapine at the end of
      the 43-week follow-up was 8.1 mg/day. Olanzapine may be a useful medication for
      the long-term adjunctive treatment of patients with bipolar disorder who exhibit 
      a poor response to mood stabilizers, such as lithium, valproate, or
      carbamazepine. These results suggest mood-stablizing properties of olanzapine.

TI  - Symptom reduction and suicide risk among patients treated with placebo in
      antipsychotic clinical trials: an analysis of the food and drug administration
      database.
PG  - 1449-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The assumption that psychotic patients assigned to placebo in clinical
      trials of antipsychotics are exposed to substantial morbidity and mortality is
      not based on data about what actually happens to such patients. This study
      assesses symptoms and risks of suicide and suicide attempts in psychotic patients
      assigned to receive placebo in clinical trials. METHOD: The authors used the Food
      and Drug Administration database to assess suicides, suicide attempts, and
      psychotic symptom reduction in clinical trials of three new antipsychotics.
      RESULTS: Among 10,118 participating patients, 26 committed suicide and 51
      attempted suicide. Rates of suicide and attempted suicide did not differ
      significantly between the placebo-treated and the drug-treated groups. Annual
      rates of suicide and attempted suicide based on patient exposure years were 1.8% 
      and 3.3%, respectively, with placebo; 0.9% and 5.7% with an established
      antipsychotic; and 0.7% and 5.0% with a new antipsychotic. Symptom reduction was 
      16.6% with new antipsychotics (N=1,203), 17.3% with established antipsychotics
      (N=261), and 1.1% with placebo (N=462). CONCLUSIONS: These data may help inform
      discussions about the use of placebo in antipsychotic clinical trials.

TI  - A double-blind comparative study of clozapine and risperidone in the management
      of severe chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 1305-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group study
      compared the efficacy and safety of therapeutic doses of clozapine and
      risperidone in patients with severe chronic schizophrenia and poor previous
      treatment response. METHOD: Male or female patients aged 18-65 years who met
      DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and study requirements for poor previous
      treatment response (N=273) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with 
      either clozapine or risperidone administered over 12 weeks in increasing
      increments. The primary efficacy measures were the magnitude of improvement in
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI)
      scores. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS: The magnitude
      of improvement in mean BPRS and CGI scores from baseline to end of the study was 
      significantly greater in the clozapine group than in the risperidone group.
      Statistically significant differences in favor of clozapine were also seen for
      most of the secondary efficacy measures (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale,
      Calgary Depression Scale, Psychotic Depression Scale, and Psychotic Anxiety
      Scale). The adverse event profile was similar for both treatment groups, with a
      lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms in the clozapine group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Clozapine showed superior efficacy over risperidone in this patient population.
      Both treatments were equally well tolerated as demonstrated through their adverse
      event profiles, although as expected clozapine was associated with a lower risk
      of extrapyramidal symptoms than risperidone.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized, prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of 
      risperidone versus haloperidol in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 360-8
AB  - The relative efficacy and safety of risperidone versus haloperidol in the
      treatment of schizoaffective disorder was studied. Sixty-two patients (29
      depressed type; 33 bipolar type) entered a three-site, randomized, double-blind, 
      6-week trial of risperidone (up to 10 mg/day) or haloperidol (up to 20 mg/day).
      Trained raters assessed baseline, weekly, and end-of-study levels of
      psychopathology with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the
      24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-24) and the
      Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania (CARS-M). The authors were unable
      to statistically distinguish between risperidone and haloperidol in the
      amelioration of psychotic and manic symptoms. In addition, there was no
      difference in worsening of mania between the two agents in either subgroup (i.e.,
      depressed or bipolar subgroups). For the total PANSS, risperidone produced a mean
      decrease of 16 points from baseline compared with a 14-point decrease with
      haloperidol. For the total CARS-M scale, risperidone and haloperidol produced
      mean change scores of 5 and 8 points, respectively, and for the CARS-M Mania
      subscale, 3 and 7 points, respectively. Additionally, risperidone produced a mean
      decrease of 13 points from the baseline 24-item HAM-D, compared with an 8-point
      decrease with haloperidol. In those patients who had more severe depressive
      symptoms (i.e., HAM-D baseline score >20), risperidone produced at least a 50%
      mean improvement in 12 (75%) of 16 patients in comparison to 8 (38%) of 21
      patients receiving haloperidol. Haloperidol produced significantly more
      extrapyramidal side effects and resulted in more dropouts caused by any side
      effect. There was no difference between risperidone and haloperidol in reducing
      both psychotic and manic symptoms in this group of patients with schizoaffective 
      disorder. Risperidone did not demonstrate a propensity to precipitate mania and
      was better tolerated than haloperidol. In those subjects with higher baseline
      HAM-D scores (i.e., >20), risperidone produced a greater improvement in
      depressive symptoms than haloperidol.

      directly compare novel drugs to each other. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study 
      was to evaluate the method of indirect meta-analysis by applying it to data on
      olanzapine versus haloperidol and risperidone versus haloperidol to enable a
      comparison between olanzapine and risperidone. METHODS: Published randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) of risperidone, olanzapine, and/or haloperidol were
      identified through literature searches (1983 to 1999) of the MEDLINE, Current
      Contents, and HealthSTAR databases and reviewed. Data for the Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale (BPRS) total score, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      negative subscale, the percentage of patients using anticholinergic drugs, and
      the percentage of patients dropping out due to lack of efficacy, side effects, or
      any cause were extracted and combined using the indirect method. These findings
      were compared with those from a direct comparative study of olanzapine and
      risperidone. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 8 RCTs comparing risperidone 
      to haloperidol and 3 comparing olanzapine to haloperidol. Only 1 trial directly
      comparing olanzapine and risperidone was found. In this trial, the change in BPRS
      total and PANSS negative subscale scores tended to be higher with olanzapine by
      1.80 and 1.10, respectively, but these differences were not statistically
      significant. Indirect meta-analysis yielded similar results. Changes in both BPRS
      total scores and PANSS negative subscale scores tended to be higher with
      olanzapine by 0.37 and 0.54, respectively, and again, the differences were not
      statistically significant. In the indirect meta-analysis, the rate of
      anticholinergic drug use was 19.5% greater among patients treated with
      risperidone than among patients treated with olanzapine (P < 0.05). In the direct
      comparative RCT, the rate was 13.1% higher among patients treated with
      risperidone (P < 0.05). The dropout rates were similar for patients treated with 
      risperidone and those treated with olanzapine in both analyses. CONCLUSION: An
      indirect meta-analysis of studies comparing olanzapine with haloperidol and
      risperidone with haloperidol yielded conclusions similar to those found in a
      direct comparative RCT of olanzapine and risperidone.

TI  - Rapid onset of therapeutic effect of risperidone versus haloperidol in a
      double-blind randomized trial.
PG  - 343-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Speed of onset of therapeutic effect is an important dimension of
      drugs employed to treat psychosis and schizophrenia. Faster onset is desirable to
      reduce the anguish caused by delusions and hallucinations and to protect patients
      and others from the consequences of poor judgment associated with psychotic
      exacerbation. Although sufficient studies have demonstrated that novel
      antipsychotics have advantages over clinically employed doses of classic drugs in
      terms of tolerability and aspects of efficacy, less is known about differences in
      speed of onset of therapeutic effect. This report consists of a post hoc
      subanalysis of data from a large double-blind, randomized pivotal trial in which 
      we compared onset of therapeutic effect between risperidone and haloperidol.
      METHOD: During an 8-week period, 227 patients with DSM-III chronic schizophrenia 
      received 4 mg/day of risperidone and 226 patients received 10 mg/day of
      haloperidol. Symptoms were assessed 6 times (days 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56) using
      the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia and the
      Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S). Data were analyzed
      using analysis of variance for multiple dependent variables and repeated-measures
      multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: The analyses revealed that patients
      receiving risperidone improved more rapidly than those receiving haloperidol as
      measured by PANSS total and CGI-S scores. Differences were most pronounced during
      the first week of treatment. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that risperidone offers 
      a more rapid response than haloperidol, particularly during the active phase of
      illness when time to response can be crucial.

TI  - Long-term olanzapine therapy in the treatment of bipolar I disorder: an
      open-label continuation phase study.
PG  - 273-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Olanzapine has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of acute mania 
      in 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. We describe the results of the
      open-label extension from one of these trials. METHOD: In a 3-week, double-blind 
      study of patients with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder, olanzapine was superior to
      placebo for the treatment of acute manic symptoms. Of the 139 patients who
      entered the double-blind phase of the 3-week study, 113 patients continued into
      the 49-week open-label extension. Efficacy measurements including the Young Mania
      Rating Scale (YMRS), the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21),
      the Clinical Global Impressions scale-Bipolar Version, and the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale and safety measurements including the Simpson-Angus
      scale, the Barnes Akathisia Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
      were completed throughout. The analysis considered all treatment results,
      starting with the first olanzapine dose. Adjunctive lithium and fluoxetine were
      allowed during the open-label extension. RESULTS: The mean length of olanzapine
      treatment was 6.6 months, with a mean modal dose of 13.9 mg/day. A significant
      mean improvement in the YMRS total score, baseline to endpoint (-18.01, p <
      .001), was observed. During treatment, 88.3% of patients experienced a remission 
      of manic symptoms (YMRS total score < or =12), and only 25.5% subsequently
      relapsed (YMRS total score > or = 15). Significant improvement in HAM-D-21 scores
      was observed (p < .001). Forty-one percent of patients were maintained on
      olanzapine monotherapy. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events
      reported were somnolence (46.0%), depression (38.9%), and weight gain (36.3%).
      CONCLUSION: During up to 1 year of olanzapine therapy, either as monotherapy or
      in combination with lithium and/or fluoxetine, patients with bipolar disorder
      demonstrated significant improvement in mania and depression symptoms with a
      favorable safety profile. Further double-blind, controlled studies are needed to 
      confirm these results.

      data mining study.
PG  - 1207-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the relation between antipsychotic drugs and myocarditis
      and cardiomyopathy. DESIGN: Data mining using bayesian statistics implemented in 
      a neural network architecture. SETTING: International database on adverse drug
      reactions run by the World Health Organization programme for international drug
      monitoring. Main outcome measures: Reports mentioning antipsychotic drugs,
      cardiomyopathy, or myocarditis. RESULTS: A strong signal existed for an
      association between clozapine and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. An association 
      was also seen with other antipsychotics as a group. The association was based on 
      sufficient cases with adequate documentation and apparent lack of confounding to 
      constitute a signal. Associations between myocarditis or cardiomyopathy and
      lithium, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and risperidone need further 
      investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Some antipsychotic drugs seem to be linked to
      cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. The study shows the potential of bayesian neural 
      networks in analysing data on drug safety.

TI  - A randomized double-blind study of risperidone and olanzapine in the treatment of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 765-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The safety and efficacy of risperidone and olanzapine were compared in
      a double-blind trial that used doses widely accepted in clinical practice.
      METHOD: Subjects (N=377) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to receive 2-6 mg/day of
      risperidone (mean modal dose=4.8 mg/day) or 5-20 mg/day of olanzapine (mean modal
      dose=12.4 mg/day) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: The two study groups were similar at
      baseline except that the olanzapine group was slightly younger than the
      risperidone group. Seventy-five percent of the participants completed the trial, 
      with no between-treatment differences in the proportion of dropouts. Similar
      proportions of the risperidone and olanzapine groups reported extrapyramidal
      symptoms (24% and 20%, respectively). Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was low
      in both groups, with no between-group differences. Total Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale scores and scores on the five Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      factors were improved in both groups at week 8 (subjects who completed the study)
      and endpoint (all subjects, including dropouts). There were overall
      between-treatment differences in efficacy. Comparison of individual factors found
      no significant differences at endpoint; at week 8, however, improvements on
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factors for positive symptoms and
      anxiety/depression were greater with risperidone than olanzapine. An increase in 
      body weight of > or =7% was seen in 27% of olanzapine participants and 12% of
      risperidone participants. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments were well tolerated and
      efficacious. The frequency and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms were similar
      in the two treatment groups. Greater reductions in severity of positive and
      affective symptoms were seen with risperidone than with olanzapine treatment
      among study completers. There was no measure on which olanzapine was superior.
      Greater weight gain was associated with olanzapine than with risperidone
      treatment.

TI  - A comparison of long-term outcome in first-episode schizophrenia following
      treatment with risperidone or a typical antipsychotic.
PG  - 179-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most reports assessing the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone
      have involved patients previously treated with typical antipsychotics. Such
      patients are more likely to have a greater resistance or intolerance to
      treatment, thus restricting our interpretation of the impact a new treatment
      might have on the course of schizophrenia and possibly biasing the results. The
      present study examines the relative effectiveness of risperidone and typical
      antipsychotics in patients being treated for their first episode of
      schizophrenia. METHOD: From a cohort of 126 patients, 2 groups of 19
      first-episode DSM-III-R/DSM-IV schizophrenia patients matched for age, gender,
      length of illness, and length of treatment and treated with either a typical
      antipsychotic or risperidone for a minimum of 1 year were compared on a number of
      outcome dimensions during their course of treatment and at follow-up. Treatment
      allocation was not random, and patients were judged to be compliant with
      medication. Patients treated with typical antipsychotics were followed up for a
      statistically nonsignificantly longer time (mean = 2.7 vs. 1.9 years). RESULTS:
      Six patients (31.6%) from the typical antipsychotic group were admitted to the
      hospital within the first year following the index admission compared with 1
      patient (5.3%) in the risperidone group (admitted at month 14). Patients in the
      risperidone group showed a statistically significantly lower length of first
      hospitalization (p < .01), utilization of inpatient beds during the course of
      treatment (p < .001), and use of anticholinergic medication (p < .05). There were
      no statistically significant differences in symptom levels, either during the
      course of treatment or at follow-up; in the use of antidepressant, antianxiety,
      or mood-stabilizing drugs; or in changes in living circumstances or employment.
      CONCLUSION: These findings confirm at least equal long-term efficacy of typical
      antipsychotics and risperidone, but a possible advantage for risperidone in
      decreased service utilization and decreased use of anticholinergic drugs.

TI  - Neuropsychological change in patients with schizophrenia after treatment with
      quetiapine or haloperidol.
PG  - 137-49
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of quetiapine, a recently introduced second
      generation antipsychotic medication, in reducing cognitive impairment in patients
      with schizophrenia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
      PATIENTS: 25 patients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, fourth edition, (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia were recruited
      from 3 Canadian hospitals. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME MEASURES: After a 48-hour
      washout period, 25 patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to
      double-blind treatment with quetiapine or haloperidol for 6 months and evaluated 
      with rating scales for psychotic symptoms, mood and extrapyramidal side effects, 
      as well as standardized neuropsychological measures sensitive to 6 cognitive
      domains: fine motor skill, attention span, verbal reasoning and fluency,
      visuospatial construction and fluency, executive skills and visuomotor tracking, 
      and immediate recall of verbal and nonverbal materials. The measures were
      repeated 8 weeks and 6 months after treatment was initiated. RESULTS: Quetiapine 
      improved psychosis and mood without inducing extrapyramidal symptoms. Quetiapine 
      also had beneficial effects on cognitive skills, particularly verbal reasoning
      and fluency skills and immediate recall, with additional improvements on
      executive skills and visuomotor tracking and on the average of the 6 cognitive
      domains with sustained treatment. Patients taking haloperidol showed improvements
      in general clinical status, but no specific improvements on the positive
      syndrome, the negative syndrome, depression ratings or cognitive skills.
      CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results support the potential value of quetiapine 
      for improving cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia and emphasize
      the importance of further research with this promising atypical antipsychotic.

TI  - Effects of olanzapine and other antipsychotics on cognitive function in chronic
      schizophrenia: a longitudinal study.
PG  - 17-28
AB  - This study aimed to determine the effect of olanzapine and other antipsychotic
      drugs on cognitive functions after 6months of treatment. Baseline, 3month and
      6month psychopathological and cognitive evaluations were made. Thirty-eight
      partially responsive outpatients with DSM-IV chronic schizophrenia diagnosis were
      included in the study. On the indication of their attending psychiatrists, 21
      patients initiated treatment with olanzapine, and 17 remained on their previous
      treatment with other antipsychotic drugs. Cognitive assessments were blind to
      medication and psychopathological status. The olanzapine group presented a
      significantly greater improvement in negative symptomatology and verbal memory
      than the comparison group in repeated-measures of MANOVAs between baseline,
      3month and 6month assessments. These differences remained statistically
      significant after covarying out gender, treatment with other atypical
      antipsychotics, biperidene doses and changes in positive and negative symptoms.
      In order to match previous differences between groups, cognitive baseline scores 
      for each test were introduced as covariates, resulting in a significant
      improvement for the olanzapine group in negative symptomatology and the
      interference task of the Stroop test.We then re-analyzed the data, dividing the
      comparison group into two groups: risperidone-treated patients (n=9) and patients
      receiving conventional antipsychotic drugs (n=8). Post-hoc analyses between
      groups were carried out with baseline cognitive assessment as covariate. The
      olanzapine group improved significantly more than the risperidone group in
      negative symptomatology and in the interference task of Stroop test. The
      improvement in the number of categories of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was
      higher in risperidone patients than in those receiving olanzapine or conventional
      antipsychotic treatment. Conventional antipsychotic drugs did not present a
      significant improvement over atypical antipsychotic drugs in any cognitive
      function. In summary, in patients suffering from chronic schizophrenia, atypical 
      antipsychotic agents were associated with slight differential improvements over
      time in attentional, verbal memory and executive functions compared with
      conventional neuroleptic drugs. No differential improvements were found in social
      functioning, verbal fluency, non-verbal domains of memory or visuo-motor
      abilities.

TI  - Response to placebo among bipolar I disorder patients experiencing their first
      manic episode.
PG  - 332-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first episode of an illness may respond differently to any
      treatment compared to multiple episodes of the same illness. This study details
      the treatment response of six first-episode manic patients who participated in a 
      previously reported study of 139 subjects comparing olanzapine to placebo in
      bipolar I mania (Tohen M, Sanger TM, McElroy SL, Tollefson GD, Chengappa KNR,
      Daniel DG. Olanzapine versus placebo in the treatment of acute mania. Am J
      Psychiatry 1999; 156: 702-709). METHODS: Six first-episode subjects participated 
      in a 3-week double-blind, random assignment, parallel group, placebo-controlled
      study of olanzapine for bipolar mania. The Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS),
      Clinical Global Impression, and Hamilton Depression ratings were administered
      weekly. Lorazepam as rescue medication was permitted for the first 10 days.
      RESULTS: Five subjects were randomized to placebo and one to olanzapine. Two
      subjects (40%) with psychotic mania (who also had their first-illness episode)
      were assigned to placebo and responded with greater than 50% reduction in the
      Y-MRS score and also remitted in 3 weeks. Another placebo-assigned subject had a 
      46% reduction in the Y-MRS scores, and two placebo-assigned subjects worsened.
      The olanzapine-assigned subject had a 44% reduction in the Y-MRS score. In
      contrast, 34 of 69 (48.6%) multiple-episode olanzapine subjects responded and 14 
      of 61 (23.0%) of placebo-treated subjects did. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary data
      set suggest there may be differences in treatment response between first-illness 
      episode versus multi-episode bipolar manic subjects. Larger numbers of subjects
      with these illness characteristics are needed to either confirm or refute this
      suggestion.

TI  - Long-term olanzapine treatment: weight change and weight-related health factors
      in schizophrenia.
PG  - 92-100
AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight change and the weight-related health factors of nonfasting
      serum glucose, serum cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure levels were
      analyzed in patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia and related disorders who
      received treatment with olanzapine for up to 3 years, and comparisons were made
      to patients treated with haloperidol. Baseline body mass index (BBMI; kg/m2) and 
      dose (mg/day) were investigated as predictors of long-term weight change
      experienced during olanzapine treatment. METHOD: This analysis retrospectively
      examined 573 patients receiving olanzapine and 103 patients receiving haloperidol
      for 39 weeks or more from a study of 1,996 patients randomly assigned 2:1 to
      either olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/day, or haloperidol, 5 to 20 mg/day. After 6 weeks 
      of acute therapy, patients continued for 1 year or more with either double-blind 
      or open-label olanzapine therapy or double-blind haloperidol therapy. RESULTS:
      Mean weight gain for olanzapine-treated patients observed for a median of 2.54
      years trended toward a plateau after the first 39 weeks of treatment with a
      last-observation-carried-forward mean weight change of 6.26 kg (13.8 lb) and a
      median of 5.90 kg (13.0 lb). This was significantly higher than that for
      haloperidol-treated patients, whose mean weight gain was 0.69 kg (1.5 lb) after
      1.15 years (p < .001). Patients with higher BBMI (> 27.6) gained significantly
      less weight during treatment with olanzapine than their lighter counterparts
      (BBMI < 27.6) (p < .001). The effect of olanzapine dose on weight was not
      significant (p > or = . 183). Median serum glucose at endpoint was not
      significantly associated (p = .096) with weight change for olanzapine. Median
      serum cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure for olanzapine-treated patients at
      endpoint showed a relationship with weight change that was statistically (p < or 
      = .001) but not clinically significant. The difference in incidence of elevated
      serum glucose, cholesterol, or diastolic blood pressure between olanzapine and
      haloperidol therapy groups was not different (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Mean weight
      gain during olanzapine treatment trended toward a plateau after the initial 39
      weeks of treatment with no further significant gain out to 3 years. Higher BBMI
      was predictive of a lower long-term weight gain, while dose was not a significant
      predictor of greater longer term weight change. The relationship between weight
      change and glucose was not statistically significant. The association between
      weight change and changes in cholesterol as well as changes in diastolic blood
      pressure was statistically significant but not considered clinically relevant
      based on the ranges observed.

TI  - Olanzapine versus risperidone. A prospective comparison of clinical and economic 
      outcomes in schizophrenia.
PG  - 567-79
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and economic outcomes associated with
      olanzapine and risperidone treatment for schizophrenia. DESIGN AND SETTING: An
      international, multicentre, double-blind, prospective study. To facilitate
      economic comparisons, our sample was restricted to patients enrolled in US sites.
      150 patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders, 4th
      edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or
      schizophreniform disorder were randomised to therapy with either olanzapine 10 to
      20 mg/day (n = 75) or risperidone 4 to 12 mg/day (n = 75) for a maximum of 28
      weeks. In addition to tolerability and efficacy assessments, use of health
      services was assessed at baseline and prospectively, at 8-week intervals and at
      study completion. Clinically important response, defined as a 40% improvement in 
      the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score, maintenance of response and
      rates of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms were compared between groups.
      Direct medical costs were estimated by assigning standardised prices to resource 
      units. Median total, inpatient/outpatient service and medication acquisition
      costs were compared between treatment groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: 
      The mean modal dosages for the olanzapine and risperidone treatment groups were
      17.7 +/- 3.4 mg/day and 7.9 +/- 3.2 mg/day, respectively. Olanzapine-treated
      patients were more likely to maintain response compared with risperidone-treated 
      patients (p = 0.048). In addition, a smaller proportion of olanzapine-treated
      patients required anticholinergic therapy compared with risperidone-treated
      patients (25.3 vs 45.3%; p = 0.016). Total per patient medical costs over the
      study interval were $US2843 (1997 values) [36%] lower in the olanzapine treatment
      group than in the risperidone treatment group (p = 0.342). Medication costs were 
      significantly higher for olanzapine-treated patients ($US2513 vs $US1581; p <
      0.001), but this difference was offset by a reduction of $US3774 (52%) in
      inpatient/outpatient service costs for olanzapine-treated patients in comparison 
      with risperidone-treated patients ($US3516 vs $US7291, p = 0.083). Median cost
      findings were consistent with results observed using other robust measures of
      central tendency and provide conservative estimates of potential savings that may
      be obtained from olanzapine therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study,
      olanzapine-treated patients experienced clinical improvements that translated
      into savings in costs of care for both inpatient and outpatient services. These
      savings offset the difference in medication acquisition cost between olanzapine
      and risperidone.

TI  - Refractory schizophrenia and atypical antipsychotics.
PG  - 409-18
AB  - Treatment resistant or refractory schizophrenia is a difficult to define
      condition of largely unknown prevalence. For 10 years, clozapine has been the
      standard treatment in this condition and is recognized unequivocally as being
      effective. However, clozapine is sometimes poorly tolerated and has the potential
      for severe toxicity. Partly as a result of this, other atypicals have recently
      been evaluated as treatments for refractory schizophrenia. In order to evaluate
      the evidence base relating to the drug treatment of refractory schizophrenia, we 
      developed a refractoriness rating based on previous work. Using this rating, we
      assessed all trials of atypicals in schizophrenia unresponsive to at least one
      drug. Overall, clozapine was consistently shown to be effective in refractory
      schizophrenia, even when stringently defined. Data relating to olanzapine and
      risperidone are equivocal at best, and there is some evidence to suggest that
      they are less effective than clozapine. There is essentially no cogent evidence
      to support the use of any other atypical in refractory schizophrenia. Clozapine
      remains the drug of choice in this condition.

      clinically eligible for treatment with clozapine.
PG  - 52-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of schizophrenic patients who fail to respond to
      adequate trials of neuroleptic drugs is a major challenge. Clozapine has been one
      treatment option; however, it is not universally effective and is limited in its 
      use by safety concerns. With the introduction of newer agents, their performance 
      relative to clozapine is of great clinical interest. METHODS: The primary
      objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine
      versus clozapine among treatment resistant DSM-IV schizophrenic patients. The
      study was primarily designed to demonstrate the "noninferiority" of olanzapine
      compared to clozapine after 18 weeks of double-blind treatment. Conclusions were 
      based on the one-sided lower 95% confidence limit about the treatment effect
      observed from the primary efficacy variable (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      [PANSS] Total). RESULTS: Mean changes from baseline to end point in PANSS Total
      score, using a last observation carried forward technique, showed that both
      agents were comparably effective in neuroleptic resistant patients, i.e.,
      demonstrated the "noninferiority" of olanzapine when compared to clozapine.
      Overall, significantly fewer olanzapine-treated patients (4%) discontinued for an
      adverse event than their clozapine-treated (14%) counterparts (p =.022). Among
      spontaneously reported adverse events, increased salivation, constipation,
      dizziness, and nausea were reported significantly more often among
      clozapine-treated patients, whereas only dry mouth was reported more often among 
      olanzapine-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine was demonstrated to be
      noninferior to clozapine and better tolerated among resistant schizophrenic
      patients clinically eligible for treatment with clozapine.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol in psychotic patients with disturbing
      neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms: a double-blind, multi-center trial.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - BACKGROUND: A randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial was started to compare
      the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during risperidone and haloperidol 
      treatment in schizophrenic patients who had disturbing EPS during their previous 
      neuroleptic treatment. Additional objectives of this trial were comparing the
      antipsychotic effectiveness of the two treatments and the use of antiparkinsonian
      medication. METHODS: Effects of flexible doses of risperidone and haloperidol
      were compared in 77 psychotic patients (83% with chronic schizophrenia) with
      disturbing neuroleptic-induced EPS (risperidone 40 patients, haloperidol 37). The
      trial was completed by 47 patients: 25 in the risperidone group (12 women, 13
      men), and 22 in the haloperidol group (10 women, 12 men). RESULTS: An adequate
      antipsychotic effect was obtained in most patients by both treatments. The
      primary aim of this trial was comparing parkinsonism measured with the
      extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS) during treatment with risperidone and
      haloperidol. Two primary parameters were selected: the change from baseline to
      the worst score during treatment of ESRS II (parkinsonism) and ESRS VI (clinical 
      global impression of severity of parkinsonism). The CGI of severity of
      parkinsonism was better with risperidone (P=0.025), while the parkinsonism total 
      score tended to be better with risperidone (P<0. 10). Before the double-blind
      treatment, 34 (of the 77) had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 18,
      haloperidol 16). During the double-blind treatment phase, 21 patients had used
      antiparkinson medication (risperidone 11, haloperidol 10). The larger reduction
      of parkinsonism in the risperidone group was not due to a difference in the use
      of anti-parkinsonian medication. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of schizophrenic
      patients with disturbing EPS during previous neuroleptic treatment, a stronger
      reduction of parkinsonism was observed with risperidone than with haloperidol.

TI  - Atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia: systematic overview
      and meta-regression analysis.
PG  - 1371-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an evidence base for recommendations on the use of atypical
      antipsychotics for patients with schizophrenia. DESIGN: Systematic overview and
      meta-regression analyses of randomised controlled trials, as a basis for formal
      development of guidelines. SUBJECTS: 12 649 patients in 52 randomised trials
      comparing atypical antipsychotics (amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine,
      quetiapine, risperidone, and sertindole) with conventional antipsychotics
      (usually haloperidol or chlorpromazine) or alternative atypical antipsychotics.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall symptom scores. Rate of drop out (as a proxy for
      tolerability) and of side effects, notably extrapyramidal side effects. RESULTS: 
      For both symptom reduction and drop out, there was substantial heterogeneity
      between the results of trials, including those evaluating the same atypical
      antipsychotic and comparator drugs. Meta-regression suggested that dose of
      conventional antipsychotic explained the heterogeneity. When the dose was </=12
      mg/day of haloperidol (or equivalent), atypical antipsychotics had no benefits in
      terms of efficacy or overall tolerability, but they still caused fewer
      extrapyramidal side effects. CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear evidence that
      atypical antipsychotics are more effective or are better tolerated than
      conventional antipsychotics. Conventional antipsychotics should usually be used
      in the initial treatment of an episode of schizophrenia unless the patient has
      previously not responded to these drugs or has unacceptable extrapyramidal side
      effects.

TI  - Long-Term use of quetiapine in elderly patients with psychotic disorders.
PG  - 1068-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that does not appear to
      increase patient risk for treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) or
      anticholinergic symptoms. Previous studies of quetiapine use in elderly patients 
      with schizophrenia and other psychoses examined short-term administration (< or =
      12 weeks). Given the growing elderly population, the commensurate increase in
      elderly patients with psychoses, and the expected increase in disease
      treatment-years, the effect of long-term quetiapine administration in older
      patients is of considerable interest. OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the
      long-term tolerability, safety, and clinical benefit of quetiapine in elderly
      patients with psychosis. METHODS: Elderly patients (> or = 65 years of age) with 
      psychotic disorders, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, participated in this 52-week, open-label,
      multicenter trial. Investigators increased (and later adjusted) daily doses of
      quetiapine on the basis of clinical response and tolerability, and assessed
      safety and efficacy. Efficacy assessments were made using the 18-item Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), Simpson-Angus
      Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). For patients who
      withdrew before week 52, analyses were performed using observed data and the last
      observation carried forward. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four patients with
      psychotic disorders (98 women and 86 men) with a mean age of 76.1 years entered
      the trial. Seventy-two percent had psychotic disorders due to general medical
      conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, and 28% had other psychotic disorders,
      most commonly schizophrenia. Overall, 89 (48%) patients completed treatment
      through 52 weeks. Median total daily dose was 137.5 mg. Reasons, for withdrawal
      included lack of efficacy (19%), adverse events or intercurrent illness (15%),
      failure to return for follow-up (13%), protocol noncompliance (3%), and
      diminished need for treatment (2%). Somnolence (31%), dizziness (17%), and
      postural hypotension (15%) were common adverse events, but they rarely resulted
      in withdrawal from therapy. EPS-related adverse events occurred in 13% of
      patients. At end point (week 52), mean total score on the Simpson-Angus Scale had
      decreased from baseline by 1.8 points, whereas changes in AIMS scores were
      negligible. No clinically important effects were reported relative to mean
      changes in hematologic, thyroid function, or hepatic function variables.
      Quetiapine treatment appeared to have no associated cardiovascular adverse
      outcomes despite cardiovascular comorbidities and unrestricted use of concomitant
      cardiovascular medications. Significant decreases in BPRS total score (n = 170, P
      < 0.001) and CGI Severity of Illness item score (n = 177, P < 0.002) were seen at
      end point (observed data and last observation carried forward). Decreases of > or
      = 20% in mean BPRS total score were observed in 83 (49%) patients. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results provide preliminary information to clinicians regarding
      tolerability, safety, and clinical improvement with quetiapine in elderly
      patients with psychotic symptoms, and support controlled studies of quetiapine in
      this patient population.

TI  - Olanzapine treatment of psychotic and behavioral symptoms in patients with
      Alzheimer disease in nursing care facilities: a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial. The HGEU Study Group.
PG  - 968-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) commonly exhibit psychosis and
      behavioral disturbances that impair patient functioning, create caregiver
      distress, and lead to institutionalization. This study was conducted to assess
      the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in treating psychosis and/or
      agitation/aggression in patients with AD. METHODS: A multicenter, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 6-week study was conducted in 206 elderly US nursing home
      residents with AD who exhibited psychotic and/or behavioral symptoms. Patients
      were randomly assigned to placebo or a fixed dose of 5, 10, or 15 mg/d of
      olanzapine. The primary efficacy measure was the sum of the Agitation/Aggression,
      Hallucinations, and Delusions items (Core Total) of the Neuropsychiatric
      Inventory-Nursing Home version. RESULTS: Low-dose olanzapine (5 and 10 mg/d)
      produced significant improvement compared with placebo on the Core Total (-7.6 vs
      -3.7 [P<.001] and -6.1 vs -3. 7 [P =.006], respectively). Core Total improvement 
      with olanzapine, 15 mg/d, was not significantly greater than placebo. The
      Occupational Disruptiveness score, reflecting the impact of patients' psychosis
      and behavioral disturbances on the caregiver, was significantly reduced in the
      5-mg/d olanzapine group compared with placebo (-2.7 vs -1.5; P =.008). Somnolence
      was significantly more common among patients receiving olanzapine (25.0%-35.8%), 
      and gait disturbance occurred in those receiving 5 or 15 mg/d (19.6% and 17.0%,
      respectively). No significant cognitive impairment, increase in extrapyramidal
      symptoms, or central anticholinergic effects were found at any olanzapine dose
      relative to placebo. CONCLUSION: Low-dose olanzapine (5 and 10 mg/d) was
      significantly superior to placebo and well tolerated in treating
      agitation/aggression and psychosis in this population of patients with AD.

TI  - Functional outcomes in schizophrenia: a comparison of olanzapine and haloperidol 
      in a European sample.
PG  - 245-55
AB  - The primary aim of this study was to compare functional outcomes between patients
      with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine or haloperidol in Europe. The sample
      consisted of European patients from a large, international, double-blind,
      randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either olanzapine 
      (n = 520) or haloperidol (n = 258) for a 6-week acute phase followed by a 46-week
      maintenance phase for responders. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced
      superior improvements compared to haloperidol-treated patients on all efficacy
      measures assessed in both phases. A greater percentage of olanzapine-treated
      patients had > or = 20% improvement in the Quality of Life Scale total score
      during both the acute (50.0% versus 31.0%, P = 0.071) and maintenance (69.5%
      versus 41.7%, P = 0.006) phases compared to haloperidol-treated patients. For
      patients who entered the maintenance phase as outpatients, olanzapine-treated
      patients were significantly less likely to require subsequent hospitalization
      compared to haloperidol-treated patients (P = 0.001). A significantly greater
      percentage of the olanzapine group compared to the haloperidol group worked
      part-time or full-time (15.1% versus 5.3%, P = 0.018), participated in useful
      work > or = 75% of the time (21.0% versus 10.5%, P = 0.038), and socialized more 
      than once a month (53.8% versus 37.9%, P = 0.004) during the maintenance phase.
      The findings from this study suggest that olanzapine's clinical profile leads to 
      reduced hospitalization and improvements in work and social functioning superior 
      to that achieved with haloperidol treatment.

TI  - Efficacy of olanzapine in acute bipolar mania: a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study. The Olanzipine HGGW Study Group.
PG  - 841-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We compared the efficacy and safety of olanzapine vs placebo for the 
      treatment of acute bipolar mania. METHODS: Four-week, randomized, double-blind,
      parallel study. A total of 115 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar
      disorder, manic or mixed, were randomized to olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 55),
      or placebo (n = 60). The primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania Rating
      Scale (Y-MRS) total score. Response and euthymia were defined, a priori, as at
      least a 50% improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than
      12 at end point in the Y-MRS total score, respectively. Safety was assessed using
      adverse events, Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS) rating scales, laboratory values,
      electrocardiograms, vital signs, and weight change. RESULTS: Olanzapine-treated
      patients demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD)
      improvement in Y-MRS total score than placebo-treated patients (-14.8 +/- 12.5
      and -8.1 +/- 12.7, respectively; P<.001), which was evident at the first
      postbaseline observation 1 week after randomization and was maintained throughout
      the study (last observation carried forward). Olanzapine-treated patients
      demonstrated a higher rate of response (65% vs 43%, respectively; P =.02) and
      euthymia (61% vs 36%, respectively; P =. 01) than placebo-treated patients. There
      were no statistically significant differences in EPSs between groups. However,
      olanzapine-treated patients had a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD)
      weight gain than placebo-treated patients (2.1 +/- 2.8 vs 0.45 +/- 2.3 kg,
      respectively) and also experienced more treatment-emergent somnolence (21
      patients [38.2%] vs 5 [8.3% ], respectively). CONCLUSION: Olanzapine demonstrated
      greater efficacy than placebo in the treatment of acute bipolar mania and was
      generally well tolerated.

TI  - Haematological safety of antipsychotic drugs.
PG  - 283-8
AB  - Many clinicians have become concerned about the safety of new antipsychotics
      particularly in view of the association of agranulocytosis with clozapine and of 
      aplastic anaemia with remoxipride. The Committee on Safety of Medicines and
      Medicines Control Agency 'yellow card' post-marketing surveillance data were
      analysed for reports of haemopoietic disorders with the 16 antipsychotics in
      common use. Corrections for relative risk were made in three separate ways: (i)
      control for degree of use, using Northern Ireland prescribing data for 1995; (ii)
      percentage of total reports from 1963 to 1996; and (iii) examination of the first
      5 years' post-marketing data only. After clozapine and remoxipride the highest
      risks of haemopoietic reactions appeared to be associated with the aliphatic
      phenothiazine derivatives thioridazine and chlorpromazine. There is therefore no 
      evidence of any increased risk with high-potency drugs such as haloperidol or
      pimozide or with the newer drugs such as sulpiride or risperidone. Continued
      vigilance, however, is necessary as more new atypicals become available and begin
      to be widely prescribed.

TI  - Low incidence of persistent tardive dyskinesia in elderly patients with dementia 
      treated with risperidone.
PG  - 1150-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors studied the incidence of tardive dyskinesia in elderly
      institutionalized patients with dementia being treated with risperidone. METHOD: 
      After participating in a 12-week multicenter double-blind study during which they
      received placebo or one of three doses of risperidone, 330 patients (mean
      age=82.5 years) with Alzheimer's, vascular, or mixed dementia were enrolled in a 
      1-year open-label study during which they received flexible doses of risperidone.
      Persistent emergent tardive dyskinesia was defined according to scores on the
      dyskinesia subscale of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. RESULTS: The mean
      modal risperidone dose was 0.96 mg/day (SD=0.53), and the median length of
      risperidone use was 273 days. The 1-year cumulative incidence of persistent
      emergent tardive dyskinesia among the 255 patients without dyskinesia at baseline
      was 2.6%. Patients with dyskinetic symptoms at baseline experienced significant
      reductions in the severity of dyskinesia. Patients who received 0.75-1.5 mg/day
      of risperidone showed a significant improvement in psychopathologic symptoms over
      the 1-year period. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no control group, the observed
      incidence of persistent tardive dyskinesia with risperidone seemed to be much
      lower than that seen in elderly patients treated with conventional neuroleptics. 
      The average optimal dose of risperidone in elderly dementia patients was found to
      be 0.75-1.5 mg/day.

TI  - A comparison of the effects of quetiapine ('seroquel') and haloperidol in
      schizophrenic patients with a history of and a demonstrated, partial response to 
      conventional antipsychotic treatment. PRIZE Study Group.
PG  - 121-31
AB  - Quetiapine ('Seroquel') is a well-tolerated, novel, atypical antipsychotic with
      consistent efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia. To date, no clinical
      studies have evaluated the effect of quetiapine in patients who only partially
      respond to conventional antipsychotics, yet this type of patient is most
      frequently seen by psychiatrists. Therefore, this international, multicentre,
      double-blind study was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of 8
      weeks' treatment of quetiapine 600 mg/day with haloperidol 20 mg/day in 288
      patients who had a history of partial response to conventional antipsychotics and
      displayed a partial or no response to 1 month of fluphenazine (20 mg/day)
      treatment. Patients on quetiapine tended to have greater improvement than those
      on haloperidol in the primary efficacy measure, mean Positive and Negative
      Symptom Scale (PANSS) score, after 4 weeks' treatment (-9.05, -5.82,
      respectively, P = 0.061) and at study end (-11.50, -8.87, respectively, P =
      0.234). Similarly, there was a trend towards patients on quetiapine demonstrating
      greater improvements in the secondary efficacy measures (Clinical Global
      Impression, PANSS subscale and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores) [week 4
      (baseline) to week 12 (end)], but the difference between treatments did not reach
      significance. Significantly more patients on quetiapine than on haloperidol
      showed a clinical response-patient response rates, defined as > 20% reduction in 
      PANSS total score between weeks 4 and 12, were 52.2% for quetiapine and 38.0% for
      haloperidol (P = 0.043). Patients receiving quetiapine required less
      anticholinergic medication (P < 0.011), had greater reduction in extrapyramidal
      symptoms (EPS) (P = 0.005) and fewer treatment-emergent EPS-related adverse
      events compared to those on haloperidol (P < 0.001). Serum prolactin
      concentrations were elevated at the end of fluphenazine treatment in 73% of
      patients. Between weeks 4 and 12, elevated serum prolactin concentrations
      significantly decreased in quetiapine-treated patients compared to those
      receiving haloperidol (P < 0.001). At the end of quetiapine treatment, 83% of
      patients had normal prolactin levels while only 21% of patients receiving
      haloperidol were within the normal range. These results suggest that quetiapine
      may make a valuable contribution to the management of patients with a history of 
      partial response to conventional antipsychotics.

TI  - Atypical antipsychotics and weight gain--a systematic review.
PG  - 416-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review systematically data relating to weight changes with atypical
      antipsychotics. METHOD: We conducted a Medline search on October 29 1999 and
      covered the period 1980-99. All recovered papers were examined for further
      relevant reports. In addition, we wrote to pharmaceutical manufacturers and 10
      practising clinicians to ask them to provide other relevant reports known to
      them. RESULTS: Eighty reports mentioning change in body weight were retrieved.
      Data relating to weight changes were of variable quality. Weight changes were
      indicated by a variety of measures. The majority of reports related to short-term
      changes. CONCLUSION: All atypical drugs, with the exception of ziprasidone, have 
      been associated with weight increases. Clozapine seems to have the highest risk
      of weight gain, followed by olanzapine and quetiapine. There is probably a lower 
      risk with risperidone, sertindole and zotepine and a still lower risk with
      amisulpride. Ziprasidone appears not to be associated with weight gain. In the
      absence of more compelling data, these rankings must be considered approximate
      and preliminary. Longer, more robust trials are needed.

TI  - A long-term, multicenter, open-label study of risperidone in elderly patients
      with psychosis. On behalf of the Risperidone Working Group.
PG  - 506-14
AB  - RATIONALE: Studies have shown that risperidone is safe and efficacious in young
      and middle-aged adults with chronic schizophrenia, but considerably fewer data
      are available on the treatment of elderly patients with schizophrenia or other
      psychotic disorders, particularly long-term outcomes. OBJECTIVE: A 12-month,
      open-label study was conducted to assess the effects of risperidone in elderly,
      chronically ill, psychotic patients. METHODS: This study enrolled 180 elderly,
      chronically ill, psychotic patients (median age, 72 years [range 54-89]), 97 of
      whom completed the 12-month study. At endpoint, the mean dose of risperidone was 
      3.7 mg/day. RESULTS: Clinical improvement (> or =20% reduction in Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Score [PANSS] total score) was achieved by 54% of patients at
      endpoint. There were significant reductions in PANSS total, subscale (positive,
      negative, and general psychopathology), and cognition cluster scores at endpoint 
      (p<0.001). Clinical Global Impressions severity of illness scores showed
      continued improvement through month 12 (p<0.001). In contrast, PANSS data from a 
      historical comparable control group of patients receiving conventional
      antipsychotic agents showed no symptom improvement over a 12-month treatment
      period. The severity of preexisting extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in patients
      treated with risperidone decreased significantly from baseline to endpoint
      (p<0.001), and the use of antiparkinsonian medication decreased from 41.1% of
      patients before the trial to 25.6% during the trial. There were no spontaneous
      reports of tardive dyskinesia (TD) and the incidence of assessed TD was 4.3% in
      contrast to the expected 26% reported in middle-aged and elderly patients
      receiving conventional antipsychotic agents for 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term
      treatment with risperidone was associated with continued symptom improvement, a
      decrease in the severity of preexising EPS, and a low incidence of TD in elderly 
      psychotic patients.

TI  - The safety of olanzapine compared with other antipsychotic drugs: results of an
      observational prospective study in patients with schizophrenia (EFESO Study).
      Pharmacoepidemiologic Study of Olanzapine in Schizophrenia.
PG  - 335-43
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Results of controlled clinical trials should be confirmed through
      safety and effectiveness studies in nonselected patient cohorts treated according
      to routine clinical practice. METHOD: Outpatients with schizophrenia (ICD-10
      criteria) entered this prospective, naturalistic study when they received a new
      prescription for an antipsychotic drug. Treatment assignment was based on purely 
      clinical criteria, as the study did not include any experimental intervention.
      Safety was evaluated through the collection of spontaneous adverse events and a
      specific questionnaire for extrapyramidal symptoms. Global clinical status was
      measured through the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and the Global 
      Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scales. RESULTS: From the 2967 patients included,
      2128 patients were treated with olanzapine as monotherapy or combined with other 
      drugs (olanzapine group), and 821 were treated with other antipsychotic drugs as 
      monotherapy or combined with other drugs (control group). There were no
      statistical differences between treatment groups at baseline regarding age,
      gender, disease duration, or severity of symptoms. Olanzapine was well tolerated 
      and effective in this study. Overall incidence of adverse events was
      significantly lower in the olanzapine group compared with the control group (p < 
      .001). Somnolence and weight gain were significantly more frequent in the
      olanzapine group, and akathisia, dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia,
      hypokinesia, and tremor were significantly higher in the control group. Clinical 
      improvement at endpoint, measured through the mean change in the CGI-S and the
      GAF, was significantly higher in the olanzapine group compared with the control
      group (p = .004). CONCLUSION: These results show that olanzapine is safe and
      effective in nonselected schizophrenic outpatients and are consistent with the
      efficacy and safety profile that olanzapine has shown in previous controlled
      clinical trials.

TI  - Clozapine, diabetes mellitus, weight gain, and lipid abnormalities: A five-year
      naturalistic study.
PG  - 975-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this 5-year naturalistic study of patients treated with
      clozapine was to examine the incidence of treatment-emergent diabetes mellitus in
      relation to other factors, including weight gain, lipid abnormalities, age,
      clozapine dose, and treatment with valproate. METHOD: Data on age, gender, race, 
      diagnosis, family history of diabetes, and age at clozapine initiation were
      collected from medical records of 82 outpatients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. Clozapine dose, data on use of valproate, and
      laboratory test results were recorded at 6-month intervals. RESULTS: The mean age
      at the time of clozapine initiation of the 82 patients was 36.4 years; 26.8% of
      the patients were women, and 91.5% were Caucasian. The mean baseline weight was
      175.5 lb, and the mean body mass index was 26.9 kg/m(2). Thirty patients (36.6%) 
      were diagnosed with diabetes during the 5-year follow-up. Weight gain, use of
      valproate, and total daily dose of clozapine were not significant risk factors
      for developing diabetes mellitus. Patients experienced significant weight gain
      that continued until approximately month 46 from initiation of clozapine. There
      was a nonsignificant increase in total serum cholesterol and a significant
      increase in serum triglycerides level. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the
      hypotheses that patients treated with clozapine experience significant weight
      gain and lipid abnormalities and appear to be at increased risk for developing
      diabetes.

TI  - Sudden death in patients receiving clozapine treatment: a preliminary
      investigation.
PG  - 325-7
AB  - The risk of sudden death during clozapine treatment is controversial. The authors
      present a review of sudden deaths that occurred at Sha'ar Menashe Mental Health
      Center between January 1991 and August 1997. The number of cases of deceased
      inpatients was retrieved from the hospital's computerized database and divided
      into three groups: sudden death, suicide, and disease-related death. Copies of
      mandatory reports of sudden death filed with the Ministry of Health were
      obtained, and the corresponding patient records were reviewed. The rates of
      sudden death, suicide, and disease-related deaths were calculated for
      clozapine-treated patients (CTPs) during and after treatment and for patients
      treated with other psychiatric agents (non-CTPs). Among 561 CTPs, there were 4
      sudden deaths during treatment, 2 sudden deaths after treatment, 2 suicides
      during treatment, and 2 disease-related deaths during treatment. Among 4918
      non-CTPs, there were 14 sudden deaths, 5 suicides, and 86 disease-related deaths,
      all of which occurred during treatment with other psychiatric agents. CTPs who
      experienced sudden death were 10.37 years younger and healthier than non-CTPs who
      experienced sudden death. The sudden death rate was 3.8 times higher for CTPs
      than for non-CTPs, whereas the rate of disease-related death was 5 times higher
      for non-CTPs than for CTPs. Contrary to expectations, the rate of suicide among
      patients currently receiving clozapine in this sample was 3.6 times higher than
      among non-CTPs. Because CTPs who experienced sudden death were also younger and
      healthier, it seems that treatment with clozapine may present a greater risk for 
      sudden death than treatment with other psychiatric medications. The limited
      number of sudden death cases and deaths from other causes should be noted so that
      these findings are considered with caution.

TI  - Longitudinal comparative study of risperidone and conventional neuroleptics for
      treating patients with schizophrenia. The Quebec Schizophrenia Study Group.
PG  - 295-304
AB  - This study compared the long-term (12 months) effectiveness of risperidone (RP)
      with that of conventional neuroleptics (CNs) in a population with chronic
      schizophrenia who had shown suboptimal response to CNs. A randomized, open,
      parallel, multicenter design was used. One hundred eighty-four subjects meeting
      DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive either RP or 
      a CN, and 165 of them completed the follow-up. Outcome measures were taken at 3, 
      6, and 12 months and included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. Within this 12-month follow-up, RP
      was found to be superior to CNs in terms of both the average change in score from
      baseline on the PANSS (p = 0.006) and the proportion of good responders (as
      defined by a 20% decrease in total PANSS scores;p = 0.03). For positive symptoms,
      the effectiveness of the RP treatment tended to increase over time. At 12 months,
      the percentage of good responders in the RP group was twice as large as that in
      the CN group (30% vs. 15%;p = 0.03). The superiority of RP over CNs was constant 
      over the three dose categories. In both the RP and the CN groups, the maximum
      decrease in psychopathology was achieved with the lowest dose range. A worsening 
      of akathisia was less frequent in subjects receiving RP than in those receiving
      CNs (p = 0.02). In conclusion, this study showed that, compared with CNs, RP is
      beneficial in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia and that some 
      of these benefits may appear only after longer-term treatment.

TI  - An assessment of clinical practice of clozapine therapy for veterans.
PG  - 669-71
AB  - Clozapine therapy for 2,996 patients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia was 
      examined over a five-year period in the Veterans Affairs health care system.
      Patients were assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). BPRS scores, which were available for
      522 patients, indicated a significant improvement, as did AIMS scores, which were
      available for 252 patients. Compared with individuals who showed a modest
      improvement, those with a more robust response to clozapine had higher initial
      BPRS scores and were three times more likely to have been suicidal in the month
      before starting clozapine therapy.

TI  - Neuropsychological change in early phase schizophrenia during 12 months of
      treatment with olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol. The Canadian
      Collaborative Group for research in schizophrenia.
PG  - 249-58
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this investigation was to test the efficacy of novel
      antipsychotic medications in the treatment of cognitive impairment in early phase
      schizophrenia. METHODS: Sixty-five patients in this multicenter double-blind
      study were randomly assigned to olanzapine (5-20 mg), risperidone (4-10 mg), or
      haloperidol (5-20 mg). Standard measures of clinical and motor syndromes were
      administered, as well as a comprehensive battery of tests to assess (1) motor
      skills, (2) attention span, (3) verbal fluency and reasoning, (4) nonverbal
      fluency and construction, (5) executive skills, and (6) immediate recall at
      baseline and after 6, 30, and 54 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: The general
      cognitive index derived from the 6 domain scores revealed a significantly greater
      benefit from treatment with olanzapine relative to haloperidol and olanzapine
      relative to risperidone, but no significant difference was shown between
      risperidone and haloperidol. The improvement related to olanzapine was apparent
      after 6 weeks and enhanced after 30 and 54 weeks of treatment. Exploratory
      within-group analyses of the 6 cognitive domains after a conservative Bonferroni 
      adjustment revealed a significant improvement with olanzapine only on the
      immediate recall domain, and similar analyses of the 17 individual tests revealed
      a significant improvement with olanzapine only on the Hooper Visual Organization 
      Test. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that olanzapine has some superior cognitive
      benefits relative to haloperidol and risperidone. A larger sample replication
      study is necessary to confirm and generalize the observations of this study and
      begin evaluation of the implications of this change to cerebral function and
      quality of life for people with schizophrenia.

TI  - Blood dyscrasias in clozapine-treated patients in Italy.
PG  - 233-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine derivative that is more
      effective than standard neuroleptic drugs in refractory schizophrenic patients,
      but its introduction in some countries was delayed by its propensity to cause
      blood dyscrasias. However, over the last ten years, different reports have
      clearly demonstrated that agranulocytosis and neutropenia can be easily prevented
      by means of strict hematologic surveillance. This article reviews the results of 
      the first five years of the Italian Clozapine Monitoring System (ICLOS). DESIGN
      AND METHODS: The hematologic parameters of 2,404 patients registered between 1995
      and 1999 were collected in a central database, before the patients began
      clozapine-treatment, weekly for the first 18 weeks, and then monthly throughout
      the duration of therapy. On the basis of conventional criteria, different risk
      levels have been identified with total leukocyte <3. 0x10(9)/L and/or an absolute
      neutrophil count <1.5x10(9)/L leading to immediate discontinuation of the drug.
      RESULTS: The analysis shows that 0.9% of the patients developed neutropenia and
      0.7% agranulocytosis, mainly during the first 18 weeks of clozapine treatment.
      Drug discontinuation led to the normalization of hematologic parameters in all
      cases, and the use of growth factors reduced the risk of infectious
      complications. Transient leukocytosis and eosinophilia were also observed but
      these did not have any serious clinical effects. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: 
      The ICLOS study confirms that regular hematologic monitoring is highly effective 
      in minimizing the incidence of clozapine-associated blood dyscrasias. The lower
      than initially expected rates of agranulocytosis and associated deaths are
      encouraging in view of the benefits of this drug in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia and other neurologic disorders.

TI  - Effects of atypical neuroleptics on sustained attention deficits in
      schizophrenia: a trial of risperidone versus haloperidol.
PG  - 311-9
AB  - To help determine whether sustained attention deficits as measured with the
      Continuous Performance Test (CPT) are stable vulnerability indicators of
      schizophrenia, we compared the CPT performance of schizophrenic patients before
      and after treatment with risperidone or haloperidol. In this double blind trial, 
      56 schizophrenic patients were randomly assigned to a 12-week regimen of either
      risperidone or haloperidol, after a 1-week washout period. The patients undertook
      two sessions of the CPT (undegraded and 25% degraded) twice, one at the end of
      the washout period and the other at the end of the study. Thirty-eight patients
      completed the study, 19 in each group. Both groups experienced significant
      improvements in clinical symptoms, and the risperidone group showed no change in 
      the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms. Despite those improvements, the CPT
      performance indexes did not change significantly from the beginning to the end of
      the study. These findings indicate that sustained attention deficits might be
      stable vulnerability indicators of schizophrenia.

      multicenter study. Risperidone Working Group.
PG  - 721-9
AB  - An international, multicenter, double-blind study was conducted in 183 patients
      with a first psychotic episode (provisional schizophreniform disorder or
      schizophrenia; DSM-III-R) treated with flexible doses of risperidone or
      haloperidol for 6 weeks. At endpoint, 63 percent of risperidone-treated patients 
      and 56 percent of haloperidol-treated patients were clinically improved (> or =
      50% reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores). Risperidone 
      was better tolerated than haloperidol: the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms
      was significantly lower in the risperidone-treated patients; significantly fewer 
      risperidone-treated patients required antiparkinsonian medication; and
      significantly fewer discontinued treatment because of adverse events. A post hoc 
      analysis revealed that low doses of these antipsychotics were efficacious in some
      patients. Furthermore, the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms and the use of
      antiparkinsonian medications were significantly lower in patients receiving low
      doses (maximum, < or = 6 mg/day) than high doses (maximum, > 6 mg/day) of
      risperidone or haloperidol. These findings are consistent with the suggestion
      that patients with a first psychotic episode may require low doses of
      antipsychotic medications. Studies designed specifically to compare low and high 
      doses of antipsychotics are warranted to help optimize treatment for these
      patients.

TI  - Amisulpride vs. risperidone in the treatment of acute exacerbations of
      schizophrenia. Amisulpride study group.
PG  - 107-17
AB  - Amisulpride, a substituted benzamide with high selectivity for dopamine D3 and D2
      receptors, was compared with the antipsychotic risperidone in patients with acute
      exacerbations of schizophrenia. The study was double-blind and involved 228
      patients allocated, after a 3-6-day wash-out period, to amisulpride 800 mg (n =
      115) or risperidone 8 mg (n = 113) for 8 weeks. Both treatments produced a marked
      improvement in schizophrenic symptomatology. Decreases in mean BPRS total score
      were 17.7 +/- 14.9 for amisulpride and 15.2 +/- 13.9 for risperidone, and all of 
      the individual factors on the BPRS showed a numerically greater improvement in
      the amisulpride than in the risperidone patients. Both treatments were equally
      effective against positive symptoms on the PANSS positive syndrome subscale;
      however, there was a trend in favor of greater improvement in negative symptoms
      assessed on the PANSS negative subscale in patients receiving amisulpride with a 
      decrease of 6.9 +/- 7.5 vs. 5.3 +/- 6.6 for risperidone (P = 0.09). Both drugs
      demonstrated good safety profiles, and scores on neurological scales (SAS, AIMS, 
      and BAS) did not increase during treatment. A comparable proportion of patients
      received antiparkinsonian medication, 30 and 23% in the amisulpride and
      risperidone groups, respectively (P = 0.21). Patients receiving risperidone
      experienced an increase in body weight, which was significantly greater than for 
      amisulpride (P = 0.026).

TI  - Antipsychotic-induced weight gain: a comprehensive research synthesis.
PG  - 1686-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the effects of
      antipsychotics-both the newer ones and the conventional ones-on body weight.
      Method: A comprehensive literature search identified 81 English- and
      non-English-language articles that included data on weight change in
      antipsychotic-treated patients. For each agent, a meta-analysis and random
      effects metaregression estimated the weight change after 10 weeks of treatment at
      a standard dose. A comprehensive narrative review was also conducted on all
      articles that did not yield quantitative information but did yield important
      qualitative information. RESULTS: Placebo was associated with a mean weight
      reduction of 0.74 kg. Among conventional agents, mean weight change ranged from a
      reduction of 0.39 kg with molindone to an increase of 3.19 kg with thioridazine. 
      Among newer antipsychotic agents, mean increases were as follows: clozapine, 4.45
      kg; olanzapine, 4.15 kg; sertindole, 2.92 kg; risperidone, 2.10 kg; and
      ziprasidone, 0.04 kg. Insufficient data were available to evaluate quetiapine at 
      10 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Both conventional and newer antipsychotics are associated 
      with weight gain. Among the newer agents, clozapine appears to have the greatest 
      potential to induce weight gain, and ziprasidone the least. The differences among
      newer agents may affect compliance with medication and health risk.

TI  - A randomized trial of risperidone, placebo, and haloperidol for behavioral
      symptoms of dementia.
PG  - 946-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of risperidone with placebo (efficacy and
      tolerability) and haloperidol (tolerability) for treating demented patients with 
      aggression and other behavioral symptoms. METHODS: A 13-week double-blind study
      involving 344 patients with dementia randomly assigned to receive placebo or
      flexible doses (0.5 to 4 mg/d) of risperidone or haloperidol. Behavioral symptoms
      were assessed by the Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale
      (BEHAVE-AD), the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and the Clinical
      Global Impression (CGI) scale. Tolerability assessments included the
      Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, sedation levels, Functional Assessment
      Staging, Mini-Mental State Examination, and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS:
      The mean dose at endpoint was 1.1 mg/d of risperidone and 1.2 mg/d of
      haloperidol. Although not significant, a higher percentage of patients receiving 
      risperidone than those receiving placebo showed clinical improvement (> or =30%
      reduction from baseline to endpoint in BEHAVE-AD total score) at endpoint and
      week 12. Reductions in the BEHAVE-AD total score were significantly greater with 
      risperidone than with placebo at week 12. In a further analysis of aggression,
      the most dominant symptom in these patients, BEHAVE-AD and CMAI aggression
      cluster scores were significantly reduced compared with placebo at endpoint and
      week 12. CGI scores were also significantly reduced at endpoint and week 12.
      Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone did not differ significantly
      from that of placebo and was less than that of haloperidol. A post hoc analysis
      showed significantly greater reductions in the BEHAVE-AD aggressiveness score
      with risperidone than haloperidol at week 12. CONCLUSION: Low-dose risperidone
      (mean 1.1 mg/d) was well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity
      and frequency of behavioral symptoms, particularly aggression, in elderly
      patients with dementia.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia and other
      psychotic disorders: quality of life and clinical outcomes of a randomized
      clinical trial.
PG  - 417-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information is available on the impact of the atypical
      antipsychotic olanzapine on quality of life (QOL). A 6-week, double-blind
      randomized multicenter trial, with a long-term extension, was conducted to
      evaluate the clinical efficacy and QOL of olanzapine and haloperidol in treating 
      schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. METHODS: A total of 828 outpatients 
      provided QOL data. Study patients were aged greater than 18 years with a
      DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or
      schizoaffective disorder and baseline BPRS (items scored on 0-6 scale) total
      scores, > or = 18 were randomized to 6 weeks of treatment with olanzapine 5 to 20
      mg/day or haloperidol 5 to 20 mg/day. Patients entered a 46-week double-blind
      extension if they demonstrated minimal clinical response and were tolerant to
      study medication. The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) and SF-36 Health Survey were
      used to evaluate QOL. RESULTS: During the 6-week acute phase, olanzapine
      treatment significantly improved BPRS total (p = 0.004), PANSS total scores (p = 
      0.043), QLS total (p = 0.005), intrapsychic foundations (p < 0.001) and
      interpersonal relations scores (p = 0.036), and SF-36 mental component summary
      scores (p < 0.001) compared with haloperidol. During the extension phase,
      olanzapine treatment significantly improved PANSS negative scores (p = 0.035) and
      improved QLS total (p = 0.001), intrapsychic foundations (p < 0.001), and
      instrumental role category scores (p = 0.015) versus haloperidol treatment.
      Significantly more haloperidol patients discontinued treatment due to adverse
      events during the acute and extension phases (p = 0.041 and p = 0.014,
      respectively). Changes in QLS total and MCS scores were associated with changes
      in clinical symptoms, depression scores and extrapyramidal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:
      Olanzapine was more effective than haloperidol in reducing severity of
      psychopathology and in improving QOL in patients with schizophrenia and other
      psychotic disorders. The QOL benefits of olanzapine, although modest, may be
      important for long-term treatment.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol on secondary memory: can newer medications aid
      learning?
PG  - 223-32
AB  - The introduction of the new generation of antipsychotic medications for the
      treatment of schizophrenia has been accompanied by a growing interest in the
      neurocognitive effects of these drugs. The present study compared the effects of 
      risperidone and haloperidol on secondary memory in a group of treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia patients. The study design included a baseline phase and two
      double-blind phases in which patients were randomly assigned to medication under 
      two different dose conditions (fixed dose and flexible dose). Secondary memory
      was assessed at baseline, fixed-dose, and flexible-dose phases, using the
      California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Six measures were selected, which formed 
      three factors (general verbal learning ability, retention, and learning
      strategy). Risperidone-treated patients showed greater improvement than
      haloperidol-treated patients in general verbal learning ability, a finding
      characterized by significant treatment effects on CVLT measures of learning
      acquisition, recall consistency, and recognition memory. After controlling for
      benztropine status, differences on the measures of learning acquisition and
      recall consistency remained significant, and differences in recognition memory
      weakened slightly (p = 0.07). No significant treatment effects were noted on
      retention or learning strategy. These findings suggest that risperidone may exert
      a facilitating effect on the acquisition of new verbal information, an effect
      that does not appear to be due to the activation of semantic encoding strategies.

TI  - Rehospitalization rates of patients recently discharged on a regimen of
      risperidone or clozapine.
PG  - 863-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine rehospitalization rates of
      people receiving risperidone or clozapine who had been discharged from state
      psychiatric hospitals in Maryland. METHOD: Rehospitalization status was monitored
      for all patients discharged from state psychiatric facilities on a regimen of
      either risperidone or clozapine between March 14, 1994, and Dec. 31, 1995.
      Patients were followed up with respect to readmission until Dec. 31, 1996. Time
      to readmission was measured by the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) formula. Risk
      factors associated with rehospitalization were examined. RESULTS: One hundred
      sixty patients were discharged on risperidone, 75 having the diagnosis of
      schizophrenia. The patients with schizophrenia were more likely to be readmitted 
      than the 85 patients with other mental disorders. Recidivism rates for
      schizophrenic patients discharged on risperidone versus those discharged on
      clozapine were not significantly different over the 24-month study period.
      However, no patient who received clozapine and remained discharged for more than 
      10 months (N = 49) was readmitted, while the readmission rate for
      risperidone-treated patients appeared to be steady up to 24 months. At 24 months 
      87% of the clozapine-treated patients and 66% of the risperidone-treated patients
      remained in the community. No clinical or demographic variables were found to
      predict rehospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the
      rehospitalization rates of patients taking the second-generation antipsychotics
      risperidone and clozapine are lower than those in previously published reports of
      conventional antipsychotic treatment.

TI  - Olanzapine versus placebo in the treatment of acute mania. Olanzapine HGEH Study 
      Group.
PG  - 702-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary intent of this study was to compare the efficacy and
      safety of olanzapine and placebo in the treatment of acute mania. METHOD: The
      design involved a random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel
      group study of 3 weeks' duration. After a 2- to 4-day screening period, qualified
      patients were assigned to either olanzapine (N = 70) or placebo (N = 69).
      Patients began double-blind therapy with either olanzapine, 10 mg, or placebo
      given once per day. After the first day of treatment, the daily dose could be
      adjusted upward or downward, as clinically indicated, by one capsule (olanzapine,
      5 mg/day) within the allowed range of one to four capsules. The primary efficacy 
      measure in the protocol was defined as a change from baseline to endpoint in
      total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale. Clinical response was defined a
      priori as a decrease of 50% or more from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale
      total score. RESULTS: The olanzapine group experienced significantly greater mean
      improvement in Young Mania Rating Scale total score than the placebo group. On
      the basis of the clinical response criteria, significantly more
      olanzapine-treated patients (48.6%) responded than those assigned to placebo
      (24.2%). Somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, and weight gain occurred significantly
      more often with olanzapine. There were no statistically significant differences
      between the olanzapine-treated and placebo-treated patients with respect to
      measures of parkinsonism, akathisia, and dyskinesias. No discontinuations of
      treatment due to adverse events occurred in the olanzapine treatment group.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that compared with placebo,
      olanzapine has superior efficacy for the symptoms of acute mania.

TI  - A comparison of the effect of clozapine with typical neuroleptics on cognitive
      function in neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Clozapine has been reported to improve selected aspects of cognitive function in 
      neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia. In this study, we report the first direct
      comparison of the effect of clozapine and typical neuroleptic drugs on cognitive 
      function in neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients with recent
      onset, neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were
      randomly assigned to either clozapine (n = 35) or typical neuroleptics (n = 29)
      and followed for 12 months. They were administered a comprehensive cognitive test
      battery at baseline and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after initiating drug 
      treatment. Treatment with clozapine improved psychomotor speed and attention
      [Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)] and verbal fluency [Category Instance
      Generation and Controlled Word Association Test (CWAT)] at 6 weeks. The
      improvement in these measures was maintained throughout the 12-month period.
      Treatment with typical neuroleptics produced no sustained improvement in any
      cognitive measure, except for a tendency to improve delayed recall memory (Verbal
      List Learning Test). The improvement in the DSST and CWAT was significantly
      greater with clozapine treatment compared to that with typical neuroleptics.
      These improvements were not related to improvement in psychopathology. These
      results suggest that clozapine is superior to typical neuroleptics in improving
      specific types of cognitive function in recent onset, neuroleptic-responsive
      schizophrenia.

      and long-term therapy.
PG  - 15-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of antipsychotic monotherapy in schizoaffective
      disorder is limited, and further constrained by safety concerns. AIMS: We aimed
      to compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety profile of the new
      pharmaceutical, olanzapine, with haloperidol. METHOD: Data were assessed from 300
      DSM-III-R schizoaffective subjects from a larger double-blind prospective
      international study. Subjects were randomly allocated to six weeks of olanzapine 
      (5-20 mg) or haloperidol (5-20 mg) treatment; responders were followed for up to 
      one year of double-blind, long-term maintenance therapy. RESULTS:
      Olanzapine-treated patients achieved a statistically significant greater
      improvement than haloperidol treated patients on overall measures of efficacy,
      including clinical response. Significantly fewer olanzapine patients left the
      study early, and fewer adverse events were observed among those receiving
      olanzapine. During maintenance, olanzapine-treated patients continued to
      experience additional improvement, with fewer EPS but more weight gain than those
      on haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine demonstrated substantial advantages over 
      the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol in the management of schizoaffective
      disorder.

      Study Group.
PG  - 491-505
AB  - In this double-blind study, patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia 
      or schizoaffective disorder were randomized to receive either ziprasidone 80
      mg/day (n = 106) or 160 mg/day (n = 104) or placebo (n = 92), for 6 weeks. Both
      doses of ziprasidone were statistically significantly more effective than placebo
      in improving the PANSS total, BPRS total, BPRS core items, CGI-S, and PANSS
      negative subscale scores (p < .05). Ziprasidone 160 mg/day significantly improved
      depressive symptoms in patients with clinically significant depression at
      baseline (MADRS > or = 14, over-all mean 23.5) (p < .05) as compared with
      placebo. The percentage of patients experiencing adverse events was similar in
      each treatment group, and resultant discontinuation was rare. The most frequent
      adverse events associated with ziprasidone were generally mild dyspepsia, nausea,
      dizziness, and transient somnolence. Ziprasidone was shown to have a very low
      liability for inducing movement disorders and weight gain. The results indicate
      that ziprasidone is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of the
      positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of an acute exacerbation of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

      associated with dementia: a randomized, double-blind trial. Risperidone Study
      Group.
PG  - 107-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report the findings from the first large, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      risperidone in the treatment of psychotic and behavioral symptoms in
      institutionalized elderly patients with dementia. METHOD: 625 patients (67.8%
      women; mean age = 82.7 years) with DSM-IV diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (73%),
      vascular dementia (15%), or mixed dementia (12%) and significant psychotic and
      behavioral symptoms were included. Each patient was randomly assigned to receive 
      placebo or 0.5 mg/day, 1 mg/day, or 2 mg/day of risperidone for 12 weeks. The
      primary outcome measure was the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease
      rating scale (BEHAVE-AD). RESULTS: The study was completed by 70% of the
      patients. Baseline Functional Assessment Staging scores were 6 or 7 in more than 
      95% of the patients, indicating severe dementia. At endpoint, significantly
      greater reductions in BEHAVE-AD total scores and psychosis and aggressiveness
      subscale scores were seen in patients receiving 1 and 2 mg/day of risperidone
      than in placebo patients (p = .005 and p < .001, respectively). At week 12, 0.5
      mg/day of risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing BEHAVE-AD aggression
      scores (p = .02). More adverse events were reported by patients receiving 2
      mg/day of risperidone than 1 mg/day. The most common dose-related adverse events 
      were extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, and mild peripheral edema. The
      frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms in patients receiving 1 mg/day of
      risperidone was not significantly greater than in placebo patients. CONCLUSION:
      Risperidone significantly improved symptoms of psychosis and aggressive behavior 
      in patients with severe dementia. Results show that 1 mg/day of risperidone is an
      appropriate dose for most elderly patients with dementia.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of olanzapine and haloperidol for patients with
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
PG  - 403-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is relatively little information regarding the efficacy of
      newer atypical antipsychotic drugs for patients with schizophrenia who are
      treatment-resistant to neuroleptic agents. Several lines of evidence suggest that
      a clinical trial of olanzapine in this population is warranted. METHODS: A
      subpopulation of patients (n = 526) meeting treatment-resistant criteria selected
      from a large, prospective, double-blind, 6-week study assessing the efficacy and 
      safety of olanzapine and haloperidol were examined. Both
      last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) and completers (observed cases) analyses 
      were conducted. RESULTS: Olanzapine demonstrated significantly greater mean
      improvement from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      negative symptoms, comorbid depressive symptoms assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale, akathisia as measured by Barnes Akathisia Scale, and
      extrapyramidal symptoms as measured by Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Rating Scale 
      with both LOCF and completers analyses. In addition, olanzapine was significantly
      superior to haloperidol for Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total (p = .006),
      PANSS total (p = .005), and PANSS positive symptoms (p = .017) in completers of
      the 6-week study. Significantly greater response rates were observed in
      olanzapine-treated (47%) than haloperidol-treated (35%) patients in the LOCF
      analysis (p = .008), but significance was not reached in the completers analysis 
      (p = .093). Mean doses (+/- SD) of olanzapine and haloperidol were 11.1 +/- 3.4
      mg/day and 10.0 +/- 3.6 mg/day, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine was
      superior to haloperidol for key symptom domains and parkinsonian side effects.
      Implications of these data for the therapeutics of this severely ill subgroup are
      discussed.

TI  - Clozapine and risperidone in chronic schizophrenia: effects on symptoms,
      parkinsonian side effects, and neuroendocrine response.
PG  - 294-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clozapine and risperidone were the first two "second-generation"
      antipsychotic drugs approved for schizophrenia. There is currently little
      information about their comparative efficacy from head-to-head clinical trials.
      The purpose of this study was to examine the comparative efficacy of clozapine
      and risperidone for positive and negative symptoms, depression, parkinsonian side
      effects, and indexes of neuroendocrine function in schizophrenic patients who met
      a priori criteria for partial response to traditional neuroleptic agents. METHOD:
      After a baseline fluphenazine treatment period, 29 patients participated in a
      6-week, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of the effects of these agents.
      RESULTS: Clozapine was superior to risperidone for positive symptoms and
      parkinsonian side effects, but there were no significant differences between the 
      drugs on two measures of negative symptoms, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total 
      scores, and depression scores. The clozapine patients, but not the risperidone
      patients, demonstrated significant reductions from the fluphenazine baseline in
      positive symptoms, total symptoms, and depression. In addition, clozapine
      produced fewer effects on plasma prolactin than risperidone or fluphenazine. The 
      mean daily doses during week 6 of the trial were 403.6 mg of clozapine and 5.9 mg
      of risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study indicate that these
      drugs have both important differences and similarities in their comparative
      efficacy in chronically ill, partially responsive patients with schizophrenia.
      Further research on second-generation antipsychotic drugs in this patient
      population that addresses key methodological issues, such as optimal dose and
      treatment duration, are needed.

TI  - Efficacy and extrapyramidal side-effects of the new antipsychotics olanzapine,
      quetiapine, risperidone, and sertindole compared to conventional antipsychotics
      and placebo. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 51-68
AB  - The objective of this meta-analysis is to summarize the efficacy and tolerability
      of the new antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine in
      schizophrenia compared to placebo and conventional antipsychotics. The main
      results are: (1) All of the 4 new drugs are more effective than placebo, but the 
      magnitude of the effect is only moderate [mean effect size, r, of all
      antipsychotics vs. placebo = 0.25, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) =
      0.22-0.28, n = 2477]. (2) According to the studies published to date, sertindole 
      and quetiapine are as effective as haloperidol, and risperidone and olanzapine
      are slightly more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of global
      schizophrenic symptomatology. (3) With respect to negative symptoms, all new
      antipsychotics are more effective than placebo. However, contrary to widespread
      opinion, so is the 'conventional' antipsychotic haloperidol. Risperidone and
      olanzapine are slightly superior, sertindole is as effective and--according to
      the only study fully published to date--quetiapine is even slightly less
      effective than haloperidol in this regard. (4) All new antipsychotics are
      associated with less frequent use of antiparkinson medication than haloperidol,
      with risperidone appearing to have a slightly less favourable EPS-profile than
      the other new antipsychotics. The methodological limitations of this review, the 
      generalizability of the results and expectations from future research are
      discussed.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol treatment in first-episode psychosis.
PG  - 79-87
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been hypothesized that the morbidity and mortality associated
      with schizophrenia can be prevented by providing effective treatment during the
      first episode of psychosis. Hence, the authors examined patients with
      first-episode psychosis to determine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine and
      haloperidol treatment. METHOD: A subpopulation of first-episode patients (N=83)
      from a large prospective, multicenter, international, double-blind, 6-week acute 
      treatment study was evaluated. These patients were selected from a pool of 1,996 
      patients who had a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective
      disorder, or schizophreniform disorder and who also met the following criteria:
      1) the length of their current psychotic episode had to be 5 or fewer years, and 
      2) patients had to be 45 years of age or younger at onset of first psychotic
      symptoms. RESULTS: Compared to haloperidol, olanzapine showed a statistically
      significantly greater reduction in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)
      total and negative scores and in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total
      and positive scores. Clinical response (defined as 40% or greater improvement in 
      BPRS total score from baseline) was also statistically significantly higher in
      olanzapine-treated patients (67.2%) than in haloperidol-treated patients (29.2%).
      Olanzapine-treated patients further showed statistically significant improvements
      in the Simpson-Angus scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale scores, while
      haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on both measures. Compared to
      olanzapine-treated multiple-episode patients in the parent study,
      olanzapine-treated first-episode patients achieved an even statistically
      significantly higher response. Haloperidol-treated first-episode patients
      experienced statistically significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms than
      haloperidol-treated multiple-episode patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patients
      experiencing first-episode psychosis, olanzapine had a risk-benefit profile
      significantly superior to that of haloperidol. The study results suggest that
      novel antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine should be considered as a preferred
      option in first-episode psychosis, on the basis of both safety and efficacy
      advantages.

TI  - Ziprasidone 40 and 120 mg/day in the acute exacerbation of schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder: a 4-week placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 173-84
AB  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, was performed to evaluate 
      the efficacy and safety of ziprasidone in 139 patients with an acute exacerbation
      of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients were randomized to receive
      ziprasidone 40 mg/day, 120 mg/day or placebo for 28 days. Ziprasidone 120 mg/day 
      was significantly more effective than placebo in improving the BPRS total, CGI-S.
      BPRS depression cluster and BPRS anergia cluster scores (all P < 0.05).
      Similarly, the percentages of patients classified as responders on the BPRS (> or
      = 30% reduction) and the CGI improvement (score < or = 2) were significantly
      greater with ziprasidone 120 mg/day compared with placebo (P < 0.05). The number 
      of patients who experienced an adverse event was similar in all three treatment
      groups, and discontinuation due to adverse events was rare (five of 91
      ziprasidone-treated patients). The most frequently reported adverse events, that 
      were more common in either ziprasidone group than in the placebo group, were
      dyspepsia, constipation, nausea and abdominal pain. There was a notably low
      incidence extrapyramidal side-effects (including akathisia) and postural
      hypotension and no pattern of laboratory abnormalities or apparent weight gain.
      Ziprasidone-treated patients were not clinically different from placebo-treated
      patients on the Simpson-Angus Rating scale, Barnes Akathisia scale and AIMS
      assessments. These results indicate that ziprasidone 120 mg/day is effective in
      the treatment of the positive, negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia
      and schizoaffective disorder with a very low side-effect burden.

TI  - Suicide prevention effects associated with clozapine therapy in schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 1029-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Suicide is a significant cause of death among patients
      with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, affecting some 10 to 15 percent 
      of these patients. This study examined annual suicide rates over a two-year
      period (1993-1995) among more than 30,000 patients with schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder who received services from the Texas Department of
      Mental Health and Mental Retardation and suicide rates over a six-year period
      (1991-1996) among a subgroup of patients treated with clozapine. RESULTS: The
      annual suicide rate for all patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective
      disorder was 63.1 per 100,000 patients, approximately five times higher than in
      the general population. In contrast, only one suicide occurred in six years among
      patients treated with clozapine who were of similar diagnosis, age, and sex, for 
      a suicide rate of about 12.7 per 100,000 patients per year. This rate is similar 
      to the 15.7 per 100,000 patients per year for all U.S. patients treated with
      clozapine, calculated from data reported as of June 1996 to the clozapine

      clozapine therapy is associated with a reduced risk of suicide among patients
      with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

TI  - Diminished suicidal and aggressive behavior, high plasma norepinephrine levels,
      and serum triglyceride levels in chronic neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenic
      patients maintained on clozapine.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - Impulsiveness and aggressiveness may be the most common behavioral correlates of 
      central serotonergic dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine whether 
      clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent with a potent serotonergic
      antagonistic activity, affects impulsiveness and aggression. Its effects on serum
      lipids, platelet-poor plasma serotonin (5-HT), and norepinephrine (NE) levels
      were also studied. Thirty neuroleptic-resistant chronic schizophrenic patients,
      maintained on clozapine for 1 year, were evaluated for aggressiveness,
      impulsiveness, and suicidality in comparison with 30 chronic schizophrenic
      patients maintained on classical antipsychotic agents for the same period of
      time. Clozapine treatment was associated with less impulsiveness (p < 0.05),
      aggressiveness (p < 0.01) and fewer suicidal attempts (p < 0.05). Serum
      triglycerides and plasma NE levels were significantly higher (p < 0.01 and p <
      0.0001, respectively) in the patients treated with clozapine, as compared with
      patients treated with classical neuroleptic drugs. The authors conclude that
      long-term clozapine treatment may be effective in controlling aggressive,
      impulsive, and suicidal behavior in neuroleptic-resistant chronic schizophrenic
      patients. The elevated plasma NE levels in patients treated with clozapine as
      compared to those treated with classical neuroleptic drugs may be relevant for
      the anti-aggressive/antisuicidal activity of clozapine.

TI  - Long-term treatment of chronic schizophrenia with risperidone: an open-label,
      multicenter study of 386 patients.
PG  - 99-106
AB  - An open-label, multicentre study was conducted to assess the long-term efficacy
      and safety of risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Three hundred
      and eighty-six patients at 70 centres in 11 countries received risperidone (2-16 
      mg/day) for up to 57 weeks; 247 patients were treated for at least 1 year. All
      but 48 patients had been treated with antipsychotic agents before entering the
      trial. The mean (+/- SD) daily risperidone dose at endpoint was 8.6 +/- 4.4 mg.
      The mean total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores were reduced
      significantly from 76.7 at baseline to 67.4 at endpoint (p < 0.001). Even though 
      no patients had acutely exacerbated symptoms at the start of the trial, mean
      scores on each of the PANSS positive, negative, and general psychopathology
      subscales were significantly reduced during the first month of open treatment,
      and these mean scores continued to improve over the course of the trial. At
      endpoint, 64% of patients were rated as improved on the Clinical Global
      Impression change scale. Extrapyramidal symptoms (scores on the Extrapyramidal
      Symptom Rating Scale) tended to decrease in severity or remained unchanged over
      the course of risperidone treatment; 27.7% of patients required antiparkinsonian 
      medication during the study. The results demonstrate that risperidone's efficacy 
      against the positive and negative symptoms of chronic schizophrenia can be
      maintained in long-term treatment with a low incidence of adverse experiences;
      moreover, the drug reduces preexisting extrapyramidal symptoms over time.

TI  - Prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in patients treated with
      clozapine compared with patients treated with conventional depot neuroleptic
      medications.
PG  - 294-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent case reports suggest the association of the emergence of
      diabetes mellitus with clozapine treatment, although conventional neuroleptics
      have also been implicated. This study was conducted to determine if there is an
      increased risk of diabetes mellitus and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)
      during clozapine treatment compared with treatment with conventional depot
      neuroleptics. METHOD: In a district hospital in northern Sweden, blood glucose
      tests and, if necessary an oral glucose tolerance test were used to assess the
      prevalence of diabetes mellitus or IGT in 63 patients treated with clozapine
      compared with 67 patients treated with conventional depot neuroleptics
      (haloperidol, zuclopenthixol, fluphenazine, perphenazine, or flupenthixol).
      Diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance were classified according to
      World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: There were 3 dropouts in the
      clozapine group and 4 in the control group. Of subjects treated with clozapine,
      12% (7/60) had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 10% (6/60) had IGT. Of subjects
      treated with depot injections of neuroleptics, 6% (4/63) had type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and 3% (2/63) had IGT. None in either group had type 1 diabetes
      mellitus. Subjects in the clozapine group were significantly (p < .001) younger
      than subjects in the control group, whereas the 2 groups did not differ with
      respect to body weight, body mass index, or prevalence of diabetes mellitus in
      first-degree relatives. CONCLUSION: Subjects treated with clozapine were more
      often classified as having type 2 diabetes mellitus or IGT compared with subjects
      in the control group. This difference did not, however, achieve statistical
      significance (p=.06).

TI  - Long-term outcome with clozapine: comparison of patients continuing and
      discontinuing treatment.
PG  - 75-8
AB  - The aim of this naturalistic study was to compare the outcome of patients who
      continued on clozapine with that of those who discontinued treatment with this
      drug. Data from 113 patients who commenced clozapine between January 1990 and
      June 1995 were available for analysis. The main outcome measures were
      hospitalization status at each anniversary since starting treatment, and the
      proportion of time spent in hospital by the survey endpoint. On average, patients
      had been ill for 11.8 years (SD 7.9) and had spent a total of 3.5 years (SD 5.3) 
      in hospital, before treatment with clozapine. The mean duration of follow-up was 
      2.5 years (SD 1.25, range: 0.32-5.5), by which time 39 patients (35%) had
      discontinued clozapine. Patients who remained on clozapine (n = 74) were no more 
      likely to have been discharged from hospital than those who discontinued it (n = 
      39) by the end of the first, second or third year of treatment (p < 0.05). Recent
      reports of the cost-effectiveness of clozapine treatment should be interpreted
      with caution.

TI  - Positive and negative symptom response to clozapine in schizophrenic patients
      with and without the deficit syndrome.
PG  - 751-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a preliminary report, the authors observed that clozapine was
      superior to haloperidol in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms in
      stable outpatients with schizophrenia. In this final report, they examine the
      effects of clozapine on positive and negative symptoms in patients with and
      without the deficit syndrome to determine which patients receive the positive
      symptom advantage of clozapine and the extent of clozapine's therapeutic effects 
      on negative symptoms. In addition, they examine the long-term effects of
      clozapine on positive, negative, and affective symptoms, social and occupational 
      functioning, and quality of life. METHOD: Seventy-five outpatients with
      schizophrenia, who met retrospective and prospective criteria for residual
      positive or negative symptoms, were entered into a 10-week double-blind,
      parallel-groups comparison of clozapine and haloperidol. Patients who completed
      the double-blind study were then entered into a 1-year open-label clozapine
      study. RESULTS: For patients who completed the 10-week double-blind study,
      clozapine was superior to haloperidol in treating positive symptoms. This effect 
      was not observed in the intent-to-treat analyses. There was no evidence of any
      superior efficacy or long-term effect of clozapine on primary or secondary
      negative symptoms. Long-term clozapine treatment was associated with significant 
      improvements in social and occupational functioning but not in overall quality of
      life. CONCLUSIONS: For schizophrenic patients who are able to tolerate clozapine 
      therapy, clozapine has superior efficacy for positive symptoms but not negative
      symptoms and is associated with long-term improvements in social and occupational
      functioning for patients with and without the deficit syndrome.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol and amitriptyline in the treatment of patients
      with a combined psychotic and depressive syndrome.
PG  - 111-20
AB  - In a multicenter, double-blind, parallel group trial, the efficacy of risperidone
      (RIS) was compared with a combination of haloperidol and amitriptyline (HAL/AMI) 
      over 6 weeks in patients with coexisting psychotic and depressive symptoms with
      either a schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, a major depression with
      psychotic features, or a nonresidual schizophrenia with major depressive symptoms
      according to DSM-III-R criteria. A total of 123 patients (62 RIS; 61 HAL/AMI)
      were included; the mean daily dosage at endpoint was 6.9 mg RIS versus 9 mg HAL
      combined with 180 mg AMI. Efficacy results for those 98 patients (47 RIS; 51
      HAL/AMI) who completed at least 3 weeks of double-blind treatment revealed in
      both treatment groups large reductions in the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale-derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (RIS 37%; HAL/AMI 51%) and the
      Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale total scores (RIS 51%; HAL/AMI 70%). The
      reductions in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Bech-Rafaelsen
      Melancholia Scale scores in the total group were significantly larger in the
      HAL/AMI group than in the RIS group (p < 0.01), mostly because of significant
      differences in the subgroup of patients suffering from depression with psychotic 
      features, whereas treatment differences in the other diagnostic subgroups were
      not significant. The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects as assessed by the 
      Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale was slightly higher under RIS (37%) than
      under HAL/AMI (31%). Adverse events were reported by 66% of RIS and 75% of
      HAL/AMI patients. The results of this trial suggest that the therapeutic effect
      of HAL/AMI is superior to RIS in the total group of patients with combined
      psychotic and depressive symptoms. However, subgroup differences have to be
      considered.

TI  - Depressive signs and symptoms in schizophrenia: a prospective blinded trial of
      olanzapine and haloperidol.
PG  - 250-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressive signs and symptoms during the course of schizophrenia are 
      common and have been associated with impaired recovery and a higher risk of
      self-harm. Novel antipsychotic agents introduce new pharmacological avenues that 
      may differentially affect schizophrenic signs and symptoms, including depression.
      METHODS: This was a 17-country investigation of 1996 patients with schizophrenia 
      or a related diagnosis randomly assigned to a blinded, comparative trial of the
      novel antipsychotic agent olanzapine (5-20 mg/d) or the conventional D2
      antagonist haloperidol (5-20 mg/d). Patients were evaluated with the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the
      Simpson-Angus Rating Scale. The trial consisted of a 6-week and a 46-week masked 
      responder maintenance period. RESULTS: At least moderate depressive signs and
      symptoms (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score, > or =16) were seen in
      slightly more than half of this sample. Although both treatments were associated 
      with short-term baseline-to-end point improvement on the Montgomery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale, olanzapine-associated improvements were significantly
      superior to those observed with haloperidol (P=.001). Furthermore, the response
      rate for the group receiving olanzapine (> or =50% improvement on the
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale after at least 3 weeks of treatment)
      was also significantly higher (P=.008). Analysis demonstrated that improvement in
      positive, negative, and/or extrapyramidal symptoms was associated with mood
      improvement (indirect effect); however, most of the olanzapine treatment effect
      on mood was a primary direct effect (57%) that alone was significantly greater
      than that seen with haloperidol treatment (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive signs
      and symptoms in schizophrenia are responsive to treatment. The pleotrophic
      pharmacological features of olanzapine, through 1 or more non-D2-mediated
      pathways, likely contribute to its superior treatment effect. Better control of
      the mood disorders accompanying schizophrenia holds the possibility for improved 
      patient outcomes.

AB  - This double-blind study evaluated the impact of treatment with olanzapine
      compared with haloperidol, and placebo on improvements in symptomatology and
      quality of life in patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia. A total 
      of 335 patients was randomized to five treatment groups; olanzapine 5 +/- 2.5
      mg/day, olanzapine 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day, olanzapine 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day, haloperidol
      15 +/- 5 mg/day, and placebo. Patients responding to treatment during the 6-week 
      acute phase were eligible to enter a 46-week extension. Efficacy measures
      included the brief psychiatric rating scale total, scale for assessment of
      negative symptoms summary, and clinical global impressions severity scores.
      Quality of life was evaluated using the quality of life scale. Data analyzed
      after 24 weeks of therapy showed that olanzapine was significantly superior to
      placebo in reducing clinical severity and significantly superior to haloperidol
      in reducing negative symptoms in patients responding to acute treatment.
      Furthermore, improvement in quality of life was observed in olanzapine-treated
      responders.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone in the treatment of
      schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
PG  - 407-18
AB  - Olanzapine and risperidone, both second-generation antipsychotic agents,
      represent two different pharmacologic strategies. Although they share some in
      vitro properties, they differ by virtue of their chemical structure, spectrum of 
      receptor binding affinities, animal neuropharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and in
      vivo neuroimaging profile. Based on such differences, it was hypothesized that
      the two compounds would show distinct safety and/or efficacy characteristics. To 
      test this hypothesis, an international, multicenter, double-blind,
      parallel-group, 28-week prospective study was conducted with 339 patients who met
      DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective 
      disorder. Results of the study indicated that both olanzapine and risperidone
      were safe and effective in the management of psychotic symptoms. However,
      olanzapine demonstrated significantly greater efficacy in negative symptoms
      (Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms summary score), as well as overall
      response rate (> or = 40% decrease in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      total score). Furthermore, a statistically significantly greater proportion of
      the olanzapine-treated than risperidone-treated patients maintained their
      response at 28 weeks based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The incidence of
      extrapyramidal side effects, hyperprolactinemia, and sexual dysfunction was
      statistically significantly lower in olanzapine-treated than risperidone-treated 
      patients. In addition, statistically significantly fewer adverse events were
      reported by olanzapine-treated patients than by their risperidone-treated
      counterparts. Thus, the differential preclinical profiles of these two drugs were
      also evident in a controlled, clinical investigation. Olanzapine seemed to have a
      risk-versus-benefit advantage.

TI  - A comparison of clozapine and haloperidol in hospitalized patients with
      refractory schizophrenia. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group 
      on Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia.
PG  - 809-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine, a relatively expensive antipsychotic drug, is widely used 
      to treat patients with refractory schizophrenia. It has a low incidence of
      extrapyramidal side effects but may cause agranulocytosis. There have been no
      long-term assessments of its effect on symptoms, social functioning, and the use 
      and cost of health care. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, one-year,
      double-blind comparative study of clozapine (in 205 patients) and haloperidol (in
      218 patients) at 15 Veterans Affairs medical centers. All participants had
      refractory schizophrenia and had been hospitalized for the disease for 30 to 364 
      days in the previous year. All patients received case-management and
      social-rehabilitation services, as clinically indicated. RESULTS: In the
      clozapine group, 117 patients (57 percent) continued their assigned treatment for
      the entire year, as compared with 61 (28 percent) of the patients in the
      haloperidol group (P<0.001). As judged according to the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale of Schizophrenia, patients in the clozapine group had 5.4 percent 
      lower symptom levels than those in the haloperidol group at all follow-up
      evaluations (mean score, 79.1 vs. 83.6; P=0.02). The differences on a
      quality-of-life scale were not significant in the intention-to-treat analysis,
      but they were significant among patients who did not cross over to the other
      treatment (P=0.003). Over a one-year period, patients assigned to clozapine had
      fewer mean days of hospitalization for psychiatric reasons than patients assigned
      to haloperidol (143.8 vs. 168.1 days, P=0.03) and used more outpatient services
      (133.6 vs. 97.9 units of service, P=0.03). The total per capita costs to society 
      were high -- $58,151 in the clozapine group and $60,885 in the haloperidol group 
      (P=0.41). The per capita costs of antipsychotic drugs were $3,199 in the
      clozapine group and $367 in the haloperidol group (P<0.001). Patients assigned to
      clozapine had less tardive dyskinesia and fewer extrapyramidal side effects.
      Agranulocytosis developed in three patients in the clozapine group; all recovered
      fully. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with refractory schizophrenia and high levels of
      hospital use, clozapine was somewhat more effective than haloperidol and had
      fewer side effects and similar overall costs.

AB  - Two hundred thirty-eight patients treated with either haloperidol or clozapine
      were investigated to shed more light on the incidence and severity of
      antipsychotic-induced liver enzyme increase. Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 
      (SGPT) increase was most frequently seen in both treatment groups. When analyzing
      the incidence rates for patients with increased liver enzyme values (serum
      glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, SGPT, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) that were
      higher than twice the upper limit of the normal range, clozapine-treated patients
      showed an SGPT increase (37.3%) significantly more frequently than patients
      treated with haloperidol (16.6%). Both patients with higher clozapine plasma
      levels and male patients were at a higher risk for an SGPT increase. At least 60%
      of the increase of the different enzymes remitted within the first 13 weeks of
      treatment. In general, the authors conclude that clozapine-induced liver enzyme
      elevation seems to be a common and mostly transient phenomenon.

TI  - Does risperidone improve verbal working memory in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia?
PG  - 799-804
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment efficacy in schizophrenia is typically defined in terms of
      symptom reduction. However, new antipsychotic medications could potentially have 
      an impact on aspects of disability, such as neurocognitive deficits. The authors 
      evaluated the effects of risperidone on verbal working memory, a memory component
      of theoretical interest because of its link to prefrontal activity and of
      practical interest because of its link to psychosocial rehabilitation. METHOD:
      Verbal working memory of 59 treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients was
      assessed as part of a randomized, double-blind comparison of treatment with
      risperidone and haloperidol. Verbal working memory was measured under both
      distracting and nondistracting conditions at baseline and after 4 weeks of both
      fixed- and flexible-dose pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: Risperidone treatment had a
      greater beneficial effect on verbal working memory than haloperidol treatment
      across testing conditions (with and without distraction) and study phases (fixed 
      and flexible dose). The treatment effect remained significant after the effects
      of benztropine cotreatment, change in psychotic symptoms, and change in negative 
      symptoms were controlled. Neither benztropine status nor symptom changes were
      significantly related to memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with
      risperidone appears to exert a more favorable effect on verbal working memory
      than treatment with a conventional neuroleptic. The beneficial effect appears to 
      be due, at least partially, to a direct effect of the drug, possibly through
      antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptor. Results from this study suggest that
      pharmacotherapeutic efficacy in schizophrenia treatment could be broadened to
      include impact on neurocognitive abilities.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective and schizophreniform disorders: results of an international
      collaborative trial.
PG  - 457-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This international, multicenter double-blind trial was designed to
      compare the therapeutic profile of an atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, with
      that of a conventional dopamine D2 antagonist, haloperidol. METHOD: A total of
      1,996 patients at 174 sites in Europe and North America were randomly assigned to
      treatment with olanzapine (N = 1,336) or haloperidol (N = 660) over 6 weeks. The 
      primary efficacy analysis involved the mean change from baseline to endpoint in
      total scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Secondary analyses
      included comparisons of the mean change in positive and negative symptoms,
      comorbid depression, extrapyramidal symptoms, and overall drug safety. RESULTS:
      Olanzapine demonstrated clinical results superior to those of haloperidol on
      overall improvement according to the BPRS and on every secondary measure,
      including depression. Olanzapine was also associated with significantly fewer
      discontinuations of treatment due to lack of drug efficacy or adverse events.
      Substantially more olanzapine-treated patients (66.5%) than haloperidol-treated
      patients (46.8%) completed 6 weeks of therapy. Statistically significant
      advantages of olanzapine treatment were related to 1) change in negative
      symptoms, 2) extrapyramidal symptom profile, 3) effect on prolactin levels, and
      4) response rate. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine shows a superior and broader spectrum
      of efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenic psychopathology, with a
      substantially more favorable safety profile, than haloperidol. It meets several
      of the criteria for a novel atypical antipsychotic agent.

AB  - The clinical efficacy of two intensive treatment packages (one including the new 
      antipsychotic risperidone and the other not doing so) was compared with that of
      standard management in 43 patients with long-standing treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. Significant differences between the groups in terms of total
      positive or total negative symptoms were not demonstrated, but the pattern of
      change between the treatment groups differed, so that benefit in positive
      symptomatology was seen in both intensive treatment groups and in negative
      symptomatology in the intensive treatment/risperidone group and the standard
      group. Changes in general psychopathology were most marked in the risperidone
      group and were compatible with a relatively non-sedative profile. Using the
      Disability Assessment Schedule, substantial significant advantages for the
      intensive treatment groups were found.

TI  - Neutropenia and agranulocytosis in patients receiving clozapine in the UK and
      Ireland.
PG  - 483-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine can cause reversible agranulocytosis and neutropenia. This 
      study documents the occurrence of blood dyscrasias and identifies predisposing
      risk factors. METHOD: An analysis was made of the haematological, demographic,
      and dosage data from a central database on 6316 patients receiving clozapine over
      four and a half years in the UK and Ireland. RESULTS: During the study period,
      2.9% of the patients developed neutropenia and 0.8% developed agranulocytosis.
      The peak incidence of both disorders was in the first 6-18 weeks of treatment.
      Fatal agranulocytosis occurred in 0.03% of patients. After the first year of
      treatment, the incidence of agranulocytosis significantly decreased to the order 
      noted with some phenothiazines. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a patient monitoring
      service kept the haematological risks associated with using clozapine within
      acceptable limits, particularly in view of the benefits of this medication in
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

TI  - Differential effect of clozapine on weight: a controlled study.
PG  - 817-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether clozapine induces more weight gain than
      haloperidol and whether weight gain is related to clinical improvement. METHOD:
      The weight and symptoms of 39 outpatients with schizophrenia who were randomly
      assigned to double-blind treatment with either clozapine or haloperidol were
      assessed. The weight and symptoms of 33 of the patients who chose to take
      clozapine during a 1-year follow-up after the study ended were also assessed.
      RESULTS: The patients treated with clozapine gained significantly more weight
      over baseline (7%) than the haloperidol-treated patients (1%). Weight gain was
      not significantly correlated with improvements in either positive or negative
      symptoms. Fifty-eight percent of the patients followed for 1 year gained at least
      10% over their baseline weight. CONCLUSIONS: Weight gain is an important side
      effect of clozapine and is unrelated to the drug's differential antipsychotic
      efficacy.

PG  - 417-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the side effect +profiles of 
      clozapine and risperidone. METHOD: The subjects were 20 outpatients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were clinically stable on a regimen
      of clozapine at the time of screening. They underwent a randomized-order
      crossover comparison of 6 weeks of risperidone treatment and 6 weeks of clozapine
      treatment. Clinical and neurocognitive variables were assessed by raters blind to
      medication status, and severity of side effects was determined from patients'
      self-reports. RESULTS: Side effect measures, but not clinical ratings, were
      significantly different after 6 weeks of treatment with the two drugs. Patients
      required more benztropine for motor effects and complained of more insomnia with 
      risperidone and more sedation with clozapine. Body weight was higher at the end
      of clozapine treatment than at the end of risperidone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this exploratory study, the side effect profiles of clozapine and risperidone
      were consistent with the different pharmacodynamic profiles of the two drugs.

TI  - Olanzapine versus placebo and haloperidol: acute phase results of the North
      American double-blind olanzapine trial.
PG  - 111-23
AB  - Olanzapine is a potential new "atypical" antipsychotic agent. The double-blind
      acute phase of this study compared three dosage ranges of olanzapine (5 +/- 2.5
      mg/day [Olz-L], 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day [Olz-M], 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day [Olz-H]) to a dosage
      range of haloperidol (15 +/- 5 mg/day [Hal]) and to placebo in the treatment of
      335 patients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia. In overall
      symptomatology improvement (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS]-total), Olz-M, 
      Olz-H, and Hal were significantly superior to placebo. In positive symptom
      improvement (BPRS-positive), Olz-M, Olz-H, and Hal were comparable and
      significantly superior to placebo. In negative symptom improvement (Scale for the
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms [SANS]-composite), Olz-L and Olz-H were
      significantly superior to placebo and Olz-H was also significantly superior to
      Hal. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included somnolence,
      agitation, asthenia, and nervousness. No acute dystonia was observed with
      olanzapine. Treatment-emergent parkinsonism occurred with Olz-H at approximately 
      one-third the rate of Hal, and akathisia occurred with Olz-H at approximately
      one-half the rate of Hal. Prolactin elevations associated with olanzapine were
      not significantly greater than those observed with placebo and were also
      significantly less than those seen with haloperidol.

TI  - Effects of the clozapine national registry system on incidence of deaths related 
      to agranulocytosis.
PG  - 52-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clozapine is the only medication distributed in the U.S. through a
      national patient registry system that provides the medication only if results of 
      patients' weekly blood tests show no evidence of significant white blood cell
      suppression, an effect that can be fatal if it progresses to advanced
      agranulocytosis. This study assessed morbidity and mortality related to
      agranulocytosis during the first five years of the national registry system.
      METHODS: Data from the national registry database maintained by the U.S.
      manufacturer of clozapine was used to determine the level of treating systems'
      adherence to the mandated program of weekly white blood cell counts, number of
      instances in which clozapine treatment was denied because of prior determination 
      of white blood cell suppression, and number of cases of agranulocytosis and
      deaths related to agranulocytosis among treated patients from February 1990, when
      clozapine was commercially introduced in the U.S., through December 1994. The
      actual numbers of cases of agranulocytosis and related deaths were compared with 
      expected outcomes based on clinical research done before the drug became
      available commercially. RESULTS: Approximately 97 percent of treating systems had
      a high overall level of adherence to the registry protocol. In 28 instances, the 
      pretreatment authorization requirement resulted in denial of clozapine; after
      additional data were considered, 15 of the patients were cleared for treatment.
      The actual incidences of 382 cases of agranulocytosis and 12 related deaths were 
      lower than the expected 995 cases and 149 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The clozapine
      national registry system fostered early detection of white blood cell
      suppression, prevented retreatment with clozapine of patients who had previously 
      developed white blood cell suppression, and brought about lower than expected
      rates of agranulocytosis and associated deaths.

PG  - 437-40
AB  - Patients were investigated to gain more insight into the incidence and time
      course of clozapine induced weight gain (n = 81) and to compare weight gain in
      patients treated with clozapine (n = 31) with that of patients treated with
      standard antipsychotics (haloperidol, n = 11). 35.7% of the patients treated with
      clozapine gained weight according to our definition. If patients gained weight on
      clozapine this side effect was apparent within the first 12 weeks of treatment.
      Deviation from normal body weight at the beginning of treatment showed a
      significant influence on weight gain. Sex, severity of illness, comedication,
      mean clozapine dose and degree of improvement did not show an influence on this
      side effect. Weight increase was significantly higher in patients treated with
      clozapine than in patients treated with haloperidol.

PG  - 712-26; discussion 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was performed in order to evaluate the short-term efficacy
      and safety of fixed risperidone doses compared to haloperidol. METHOD: In a
      multi-national, parallel-group, double-blind study, patients with chronic
      schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were randomly assigned to risperidone 1, 4, 8, 12 or 16
      mg or haloperidol 10 mg daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by the Positive 
      and Negative Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia (PANSS) and clinical global
      impression (CGI), and safety primarily by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale
      (ESRS). RESULTS: One thousand three hundred and sixty-two patients were
      evaluated. The optimum risperidone doses were 4 mg and 8 mg, with response rates 
      of 63.4% (56.8%; 69.7%) and 65.8% (59.2%; 71.9%) respectively. Response rate in
      haloperidol-treated patients was 58.7% (52.0%; 65.3%); the 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) of the differences between risperidone 4 mg or 8 mg and
      haloperidol were (- 4.3%; 13.7%) and (- 1.9%; 16.0%) respectively. There were no 
      significant differences in CGI scores at endpoint between risperidone 4 mg, 8 mg,
      12 mg and 16 mg and haloperidol (3.0, 3.0, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.1 respectively); the
      95% CI of the differences between risperidone 4 mg or 8 mg and haloperidol were (
      - 0.4; 0.1) and ( - 0.3; 0.2) respectively. Mean shifts to the maximum total ESRS
      scores versus baseline (mean (confidence interval)) were significantly greater in
      haloperidol-treated patients (5.1 (4.0; 6.2)) than in the risperidone 1, 4, 8 and
      12 mg groups (1.1 (0.3; 1.9); 1.8 (0.9; 2.7); 2.7 (1.8; 3.6) and 3.2 (2.3; 4.1)
      respectively (P < 0.05)). CONCLUSION: Risperidone is an effective antipsychotic
      for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia; doses of 4 and 8 mg seem to be
      optimal and have a lower incidence of side-effects than haloperidol.

TI  - Risperidone versus zuclopenthixol in the treatment of acute schizophrenic
      episodes: a double-blind parallel-group trial.
PG  - 271-7
AB  - A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, parallel-group study was conducted in
      Finland to compare the efficacy and safety of risperidone with zuclopenthixol in 
      patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. 
      Ninety-eight patients were randomly assigned to treatment with risperidone (n =
      48) or zuclopenthixol (n = 50), in variable doses, for 6 weeks. The mean daily
      doses of risperidone and zuclopenthixol at the end of the trial were 8 mg and 38 
      mg respectively. Efficacy was assessed throughout by the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia and Clinical Global Impression. Safety
      assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, UKU Side-Effect
      Rating Scale, vital signs, body weight and laboratory screening. The results
      indicate that risperidone is at least as effective as zuclopenthixol for the
      treatment of acute schizophrenic episodes, with a trend towards greater
      improvement in the overall severity of symptoms. The onset of action was
      significantly shorter with risperidone than with zuclopenthixol. Although the
      general tolerability of the two drugs was comparable, fewer patients experienced 
      extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone, so that significantly fewer
      risperidone-treated patients required antiparkinsonian medication.

TI  - Extrapyramidal side effects of clozapine and haloperidol.
PG  - 52-6
AB  - Neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) were evaluated in 92
      patients treated with clozapine for the first time and 59 patients treated with
      haloperidol followed in a drug monitoring program. Side effects were measured by 
      the Columbia University Rating Scale, the Simpson Dyskinesia Scale and the
      Hillside Akathisia Scale. The cumulative incidence rate for tremor was found to
      be 24.4% in the clozapine group and 39.3% in the haloperidol group. This did not 
      amount to a statistically significant group difference. Bradykinesia was observed
      in 21.8% of the patients treated with clozapine and in 47.7% of the patients of
      haloperidol (P = 0.011). In the clozapine group the akathisia incidence rate was 
      5.6%, whereas haloperidol patients showed a higher rate of 31.7% (P = 0.005). Our
      results show higher incidence rates of tremor and bradykinesia during clozapine
      treatment than previous studies. We conclude that clozapine is not entirely free 
      of EPS, but they are usually less severe and of a different quality than side
      effects induced by typical antipsychotics.

TI  - Reduction of suicidality during clozapine treatment of neuroleptic-resistant
      schizophrenia: impact on risk-benefit assessment.
PG  - 183-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Suicide has been reported to occur in 9%-13% of schizophrenic
      patients. It has been suggested that neuroleptic-resistant or
      neuroleptic-intolerant schizophrenic patients are at higher risk for suicide than
      neuroleptic-responsive patients. Clozapine is the treatment of choice for
      neuroleptic-resistant patients, but its use has been greatly limited because of
      its ability to cause potentially fatal agranulocytosis. The purpose of this study
      was to compare the suicidality of neuroleptic-resistant and
      neuroleptic-responsive patients and to determine if clozapine treatment decreased
      suicidality in the former group. METHOD: Prior episodes of suicidality were
      assessed in a total of 237 neuroleptic-responsive and 184 neuroleptic-resistant
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Eighty-eight of the
      neuroleptic-resistant patients were treated with clozapine and prospectively
      evaluated for suicidality for periods of 6 months to 7 years. RESULTS: There was 
      no significant difference in prior suicidal episodes between
      neuroleptic-responsive and neuroleptic-resistant patients. Clozapine treatment of
      the neuroleptic-resistant patients during the follow-up period resulted in
      markedly less suicidality. The number of suicide attempts with a high-probability
      of success decreased from five to zero. This decrease in suicidality was
      associated with improvement in depression and hopelessness. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest a basis for reevaluation of the risk-benefit assessment of
      clozapine, i.e., that the overall morbidity and mortality of patients with
      neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia are less with clozapine treatment than with
      typical neuroleptic drugs because of less suicidality. This conclusion also has
      implications for increasing the use of clozapine with neuroleptic-responsive
      patients.

TI  - Clozapine-related seizures: experience with 5,629 patients.
PG  - 2247-9
AB  - We reviewed the incidence, clinical features, and management of all
      clozapine-related seizures in 5,629 patients monitored by the Clozaril Patient
      Management System, during the first 6 months after marketing. Seventy-one
      patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures yielding a frequency of 1.3%. One 
      patient had myoclonic seizures prior to generalization. Seizures tended to occur 
      at low doses (< 300 mg/d) during the titration phase, and at high doses (> or =
      600 mg/d) during the maintenance phase. Patients with a history of seizures or
      epilepsy were more likely to have seizures soon after initiation of therapy, on
      low doses. Twenty-nine of 37 patients (78%) who had seizures and were
      rechallenged with clozapine were able to continue the medication with dose
      reduction and more-gradual dose titration, or with the addition of an
      antiepileptic medication.

TI  - The comparative efficacy and long-term effect of clozapine treatment on
      neuropsychological test performance.
PG  - 717-25
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that clozapine may improve neuropsychological
      test performance. The current study was designed to examine the comparative
      efficacy and the long-term effect of clozapine (versus haloperidol), on
      neuropsychological test performance. Neuropsychological measures of
      executive/attention, visuospatial, and memory function were administered to
      schizophrenic patients at baseline, at the end of a 10-week double-blind study,
      and after 1 year of open clozapine treatment. Symptoms and function ratings were 
      obtained at the same time points. The 10-week double-blind study revealed
      significant group-by-time interactions for two measures: Categorical Fluency and 
      WAIS-R Block Design. At the end of 1 year of open treatment there were
      significant improvements in Verbal Fluency, Mooney Faces Closure, and WAIS-R
      Block Design performance, and trend improvements in Stroop Color-Word
      Interference, Category Fluency, and WMS-R Logical Memory performance.
      Improvements in neuropsychological performance were unrelated to symptom changes.
      Change in selected neuropsychological measures were significantly correlated with
      improvement in quality of life. The results suggest that long-term clozapine
      treatment may have beneficial effects on a broad range of cognitive functions.

TI  - Clozapine and weight gain.
PG  - 157-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of clozapine treatment and weight
      gain, we studied short- and long-term weight gain, correlation of weight gain
      with treatment response, and risk factors for weight gain in 82 patients with
      chronic schizophrenia who received clozapine treatment for up to 90 months.
      METHOD: Weight values were obtained through retrospective chart review. Clozapine
      was titrated over an average of 3 to 5 weeks up to a dose of 500 to 600 mg/day.
      Psychopathology was assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the
      Clinical Global Impressions scale. RESULTS: A clinically significant weight gain 
      occurred mostly during the first 6 to 12 months, but continued well into the
      third year of treatment. Weight gain and treatment response were not correlated, 
      and early weight gain was not a predictor of response. The cumulative incidence
      of patients becoming substantially overweight exceeded 50%. Being underweight at 
      baseline correlated with maximum amount gained (p = .000), and being overweight
      at baseline correlated with percentage above ideal weight (p = .006). CONCLUSION:
      Treatment with clozapine is associated with a high incidence of substantial
      weight gain, posing a potential long-term health risk. Studies are needed of the 
      underlying mechanisms of weight gain, as well as the treatment for this side
      effect.

TI  - Changes in single symptoms and separate factors of the schizophrenic syndrome
      after treatment with risperidone or haloperidol.
PG  - 108-13
AB  - Risperidone, a rather selective blocker of D-2 and 5-HT-2 receptors, was, in the 
      doses 1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg and 16 mg a day, compared to the rather selective
      D-2 blocker haloperidol in the dose of 10 mg a day, in 88 chronic schizophrenic
      patients. After one week placebo wash-out, the patients were randomly assigned to
      one of the six treatment groups and the study was performed as a double blind
      parallel-group study for 8 weeks. In the present analysis, a special emphasis has
      been laid on the effects on single symptoms and separate factors in the
      schizophrenic syndrome. Overall, risperidone in a dose of 4 mg a day was
      comparable to haloperidol in a dose of 10 mg a day. Risperidone was found to have
      a curvilinear dose-response curve with an optimum effect of 4 mg day on the
      negative, anxious/depressive and cognitive factors and with an optimum effect of 
      8 mg day on the positive and excited factors. While haloperidol had significant
      effects on the negative and anxious/depressive factors, risperidone had
      significant effects on all five factors - the positive, the negative, the
      excited, the anxious/depressive and the cognitive. The fact that the novel drug
      had significant effects on the cognitive factor might be of great importance as
      concerns the possibilities for rehabilitation of chronic schizophrenic patients.

TI  - Risperidone versus perphenazine in the treatment of chronic schizophrenic
      patients with acute exacerbations.
PG  - 395-402
AB  - Risperidone (RIS), a new neuroleptic with 5-HT2- and dopamine D2
      receptor-blocking properties, was compared with perphenazine (PER) in a
      double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group study in 107 chronic schizophrenics
      with acute exacerbation. RIS 5-15 mg or PER 16-48 mg daily was given for 8 weeks.
      Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression. Seventy-eight patients completed the
      trial; there was an equal number of dropouts on both drugs. The mean daily dose
      at endpoint was 8.5 mg RIS and 28 mg PER. The reduction in total PANSS score to
      endpoint did not differ significantly, although there was a tendency in favour of
      RIS. The number of patients with predominantly negative symptoms who showed at
      least 20% reduction in total PANSS score was significantly larger in the RIS
      group. Furthermore, the number of patients showing at least 20% reduction in
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score (BPRS being a subscale of PANSS) was 
      significantly larger in the RIS group. The hostility cluster of BPRS improved
      more on RIS than on PER in the endpoint analysis. The overall prevalence of side 
      effects was fairly similar in the two groups.

TI  - [Methodological and regulatory features of clinical trials for behavioral and
      psychological symptoms in the course of dementia].
PG  - 267-74
AB  - During the last few years there has been a growing awareness of behavioral and
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These symptoms are usually classified 
      in syndromes, which include psychosis, depression, agitation and sleep
      disturbances. BPSD have a major impact on the clinical course, prognosis and the 
      quality of life of patients and caregivers. Moreover, BPSD considerably increase 
      the social costs of dementia, since they often result in institutionalization.
      The therapy of BPSD was initially based on an empirical syndromic approach.
      However, in more recent years the efficacy and safety of treatments for these
      conditions have been tested in several controlled clinical trials. This paper
      addresses some of the methodological and regulatory issues that are relevant to
      the conducting of clinical trials for BPSD.

TI  - [Clozapine and pregnancy].
PG  - 119-24
AB  - This article reviews the relations between clozapine and pregnancy. Six case
      reports are identified in the literature of pregnant patients who received
      clozapine. Novartis at Basle, Switzerland, through its pharmacovigilance and
      epidemiology, service, has data on nearly 200 cases summarized in this article.
      We also describe the case of a patient with paranoid schizophrenia who was
      hospitalized 10 times between the age of 22 to 32. She received clozapine when
      she was 29 years old and, with a daily dosage of 350 mg, she became asymptomatic.
      At the age of 33 and 37, she became pregnant and continued clozapine during her 2
      pregnancies. During her first pregnancy, she received insulin due to gestational 
      diabetes associated with a body weight mass (BWM) of 30.4 (N = 20 to 25). During 
      her second pregnancy, the BWM was 23.7 and she did not develop diabetes. She
      delivered at term 2 daughters who are at the time of this report 5 and 3 years
      old. The two girls are doing well and have no developmental delay. Psychotic
      symptoms exacerbation: the plasma concentration of clozapine diminishes during
      pregnancy due to a higher hepatic metabolism and distribution volume. Monitoring 
      plasma concentration of clozapine can help to adjust its dosage. In case of
      psychotic symptoms exacerbation, the following can be recommended: 1) Increase
      the clozapine dosage; 2) Add a classic antipsychotic like perphenazine,
      trifluoperazine or haloperidol. Diabetes: obesity, glucose intolerance or a
      family history of diabetes are risk factors to develop gestational diabetes. The 
      follow-up of patients, who take an atypical antipsychotic, should include
      constant monitoring of the blood glucose or Hb1A and lipid dosages. Complications
      at labor: Clozapine increases the secretion of oxytocine and the contraction of
      the uterine muscle. But, no studies can explain how clozapine affects the labor
      exactly. Some case studies report use of forceps, vacuum or cesarean.
      CONVULSIONS: Stoner (1997) described neonatal convulsions 8 days after birth. The
      mother was receiving 350 mg of clozapine, but also lorazepam and haloperidol
      during her pregnancy. The newborn withdrawal of lorazepam can increase the risk
      of convulsions and also haloperidol can diminish the convulsion threshold. Floppy
      infant syndrome: in the case described by Dimichele (1996), the mother received a
      daily dosage of 300 mg of clozapine and 2.5 mg of lorazepam 3 to 5 times a day.
      This can explain hypotonia. Stoner (1997) reports a second case where a mother,
      who received 600 mg of clozapine during pregnancy, gave birth to a child who had 
      no convulsions neither hypotonia. DEVELOPMENT: The cases described concerning
      studies of children until age 2 to 3 years by Stoner (1997) and Dickson (1998)
      and until 6 years old by Barnas (1994), do not mention any developmental problem,
      similar to the two daughters of our patient. The pharmacovigilance service of
      Novarits reports 6% of malformations. But these reports must be considered with
      caution since they represent only the pregnancies reported spontaneously to the
      pharmaceutical company. This is only a portion of all pregnancies associated with
      clozapine. CONCLUSION: No specific risks for the mother and children can be
      attributed to the use of clozapine during pregnancy. However, the plasma
      concentration of clozapine is higher in the fetus compared to the mother (Barnas,
      1994); therefore, a minimal dosage should be used. Since clozapine is present in 
      the maternal milk, breast feeding should be avoided. The advantages to use
      clozapine during pregnancy must exceed the risks. It is justified to continue the
      use of this medication even if data on classic antipsychotics (e.g.: haloperidol)
      are more extensive. Because the risk of psychotic exacerbation is higher, the
      substitution of clozapine is not recommended. The psychosocial support and the
      obstetrical follow-up must be intensive too. An institutional pharmacovigilance
      service should complement the one provided by the industry. Also, further
      case-control and cohort studies are essential to better estimate the long-term
      risks.

TI  - The effects of an educational intervention on antipsychotic-induced weight gain.
PG  - 237-41
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the effect of an educational intervention on
      antipsychotic-induced weight gain among patients with schizophrenia. DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Quasi-experimental. Seventy patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder entered this 6-month study condicted in
      the United States. All participants began receiving olanzapine treatment when
      they entered the study. The patients were then randomly assigned to an
      intervention group or a standard care group. Over the next 4-months, the
      intervention group participated in weekly psychoeducation classes focused on
      nutrition, exercise, and living a healthy lifestyle. Patients were followed for
      an additional 2 months to assess weight change. FINDINGS: A statistically
      significant difference in weight change between the two groups was observed
      post-treatment and at endpoint. At endpoint, the mean weight change of the
      intervention group was -.06 pounds, while the mean weight change in the standard 
      care group was 9.57 pounds. In both groups, men gained significantly more weight 
      than did women. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that a structured educational
      intervention might have a positive effect on antipsychotic-induced weight gain
      among patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Cognitive, psychiatric and motor response to galantamine in Parkinson's disease
      with dementia.
PG  - 937-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholinesterase inhibitors with additional nicotinic activity, such as
      galantamine, may be useful in PD patients with dementia (PDD) since stimulation
      of nicotinic receptors may prevent the down-regulation that is likely to
      accompany cholinesterase inhibition and facilitate dopamine release in the
      striatum. METHODS: Sixteen PDD patients (six female) with onset of cognitive
      impairment after at least one year with parkinsonism participated in this
      open-label trial of galantamine. Cognitive, psychiatric, and motor symptoms were 
      assessed before and after 8 weeks of treatment with galantamine using
      unstructured clinical assessment as well as rating scales including the
      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), clock drawing test, verbal fluency and
      selected items from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). RESULTS: Age (mean, SD)
      was 75.6 (5.2) years, duration of PD 13.4 (5.9), duration of dementia 2.1 (1.7)
      years, Hoehn and Yahr score was 3.8 (0.8) and baseline MMSE score was 17.7 (6.7).
      Side-effects caused discontinuation in three patients, but were rare and mild in 
      the remaining 13. Improvement of global mental symptoms was noted in eight
      patients, whereas worsening was reported in four. Hallucinations improved in
      seven of the nine patients with hallucinations before treatment. Parkinsonism
      improved in six patients, but a mild worsening of tremor was noted in three.
      Clock-drawing improved (p=0.016), and trends towards improvement on MMSE (p=0.09)
      and verbal fluency (p=0.16) were found. CONCLUSIONS: Although controlled trials
      are needed, the findings suggest that galantamine is useful in patients with PDD.

TI  - Subsyndromal symptoms assessed in longitudinal, prospective follow-up of a cohort
      of patients with bipolar disorder.
PG  - 349-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with bipolar disorder (BD) do not regain full function 
      following an acute illness episode, but the extent to which this impairment is
      the result of persistent symptoms has not been well established. This study
      examined factors associated with persistent subsyndromal symptoms in a well
      characterized group of BD patients who were prospectively followed for an average
      of 3 years. METHODS: Detailed life charting data from 138 patients with BD were
      reviewed. Patients were categorized into euthymic, subsyndromal or syndromal
      groups according to the clinical state during their most recent year of
      follow-up. The three groups were then examined with respect to comorbidity,
      function and treatment received. RESULTS: Patients with subsyndromal symptoms had
      high rates of comorbid anxiety disorders, and were more likely to have increased 
      rates of eating disorders as well. Patients with subsyndromal symptoms had lower 
      global assessment of function (GAF) scores than euthymic patients, and had as
      many clinic contacts and medication trials as patients with full episodes of
      illness. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent subsyndromal symptoms in BD patients are
      associated with high rates of comorbidity that is important to recognize and
      treat in order to optimize mood and functioning.

TI  - An overview of recent findings of the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network (Part
      I).
PG  - 310-9
AB  - AIM AND METHODS: Selected recent findings of the Stanley Foundation Bipolar
      Network are briefly reviewed and their clinical implications discussed. RESULTS: 
      Daily prospective ratings on the NIMH-LCM indicate a high degree of residual
      depressive morbidity (three times that of hypomania or mania) despite active
      psychopharmacological treatment with a variety of modalities including mood
      stabilizers, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines, as well as antipsychotics as
      necessary. The rates of switching into brief to full hypomania or mania during
      the use of antidepressants is described, and new data suggesting the potential
      utility of continuing antidepressants in the small group of patients showing an
      initial acute and persistent response is noted. Bipolar patients with a history
      of major environmental adversities in childhood have a more severe course of
      illness and an increased incidence of suicide attempts compared with those
      without. Preliminary open data suggest useful antidepressant effects of the
      atypical antipsychotic quetiapine, while a double-blind randomized controlled
      study failed to show efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids (6 g of eicosapentaenoic
      acid compared with placebo for 4 months) in the treatment of either acute
      depression or rapid cycling. The high prevalence of overweight and increased
      incidence of antithyroid antibodies in patients with bipolar illness is
      highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings suggest a very high degree of 
      comorbidity and treatment resistance in outpatients with bipolar illness treated 
      in academic settings and the need to develop not only new treatment approaches,
      but also much earlier illness recognition, diagnosis, and intervention in an
      attempt to reverse or prevent this illness burden.

TI  - Cannabinoids reduce symptoms of Tourette's syndrome.
PG  - 1717-25
AB  - Currently, the treatment of Tourette's syndrome (TS) is unsatisfactory.
      Therefore, there is expanding interest in new therapeutical strategies. Anecdotal
      reports suggested that the use of cannabis might improve not only tics, but also 
      behavioural problems in patients with TS. A single-dose, cross-over study in 12
      patients, as well as a 6-week, randomised trial in 24 patients, demonstrated that
      Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the most psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, 
      reduces tics in TS patients. No serious adverse effects occurred and no
      impairment on neuropsychological performance was observed. If well-established
      drugs either fail to improve tics or cause significant adverse effects, in adult 
      patients, therapy with Delta9-THC should be tried. At present, it remains unclear
      whether herbal cannabis, different natural or synthetic cannabinoid CB1-receptor 
      agonists or agents that interfere with the inactivation of endocannabinoids, may 
      have the best adverse effect profile in TS.

TI  - Towards the pharmacotherapy of eating disorders.
PG  - 1659-78
AB  - The purpose of this review is to discuss pharmacological options for the
      treatment of patients with eating disorders. Sequentially described are
      pharmacotherapy studies of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and
      binge-eating disorder (BED). The quantity of drug trials performed with AN
      patients has been very limited. While the majority of studies have failed to show
      medication efficacy for the acute treatment of AN, there is data which suggests
      that fluoxetine hydrochloride may play a role in preventing relapse during
      maintenance therapy. Atypical antipsychotics, most often olanzapine, have shown
      promise in a number of uncontrolled studies. BN has been most extensively
      studied, with the majority of pharmacological trials focusing on antidepressants.
      Fluoxetine, at a dose of 60 mg/day, is FDA-approved for the treatment of BN.
      Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is of
      well-established utility in BN and data suggests that the combination of an
      antidepressant plus CBT is superior to either treatment alone. Recently, there
      has been interest in the 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron, and the anticonvulsant,
      topiramate. BED investigators have focused largely on antidepressants, which may 
      reduce symptoms of depression and augment psychotherapy. While sibutramine and
      topiramate have both been associated with weight loss in controlled trials, the
      former appears to be fairly well-tolerated and the latter appears to be
      responsible for the emergence of significant cognitive and peripheral nervous
      system side effects in some patients. Further pharmacological research with
      eating disorder patients is needed, particularly in the areas of AN and BED.
      Also, pharmacological augmentation strategies for those not responding to primary
      therapies should be explored.

TI  - Suicide risk in bipolar disorder during treatment with lithium and divalproex.
PG  - 1467-73
AB  - CONTEXT: Several studies have suggested that lithium treatment reduces risk of
      suicide in bipolar disorder, but no research has examined suicide risk during
      treatment with divalproex, the most commonly prescribed mood-stabilizing drug in 
      the United States. OBJECTIVE: To compare risk of suicide attempt and suicide
      death during treatment with lithium with that during treatment with divalproex.
      DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort study conducted at 2 large integrated
      health plans in California and Washington. PATIENTS: Population-based sample of
      20 638 health plan members aged 14 years or older who had at least 1 outpatient
      diagnosis of bipolar disorder and at least 1 filled prescription for lithium,
      divalproex, or carbamazepine between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 2001.
      Follow-up for each individual began with first qualifying prescription and ended 
      with death, disenrollment from the health plan, or end of the study period. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Suicide attempt, recorded as a hospital discharge diagnosis or 
      an emergency department diagnosis; suicide death, recorded on death certificate. 
      RESULTS: In both health plans, unadjusted rates were greater during treatment
      with divalproex than during treatment with lithium for emergency department
      suicide attempt (31.3 vs 10.8 per 1000 person-years; P<.001), suicide attempt
      resulting in hospitalization (10.5 vs 4.2 per 1000 person-years; P<.001), and
      suicide death (1.7 vs 0.7 per 1000 person-years; P =.04). After adjustment for
      age, sex, health plan, year of diagnosis, comorbid medical and psychiatric
      conditions, and concomitant use of other psychotropic drugs, risk of suicide
      death was 2.7 times higher (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-6.3; P =.03) during
      treatment with divalproex than during treatment with lithium. Corresponding
      hazard ratios for nonfatal attempts were 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2-2.3; P =.002) for
      attempts resulting in hospitalization and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.4-2.2; P<.001) for
      attempts diagnosed in the emergency department. CONCLUSION: Among patients
      treated for bipolar disorder, risk of suicide attempt and suicide death is lower 
      during treatment with lithium than during treatment with divalproex.

TI  - Schizophrenia is not associated with DRD4 48-base-pair-repeat length or
      individual alleles: results of a meta-analysis.
PG  - 629-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gene DRD4, coding for dopamine receptor D4, was considered a
      candidate for association with schizophrenia based on its upregulation in
      postmortem schizophrenic brain and affinity for clozapine. Many studies sought
      allelic association of a 48-base-pair repeat in DRD4 exon 3 with schizophrenia,
      but found no strong evidence for a relationship. The present work sought to
      determine if this observation reflected the true absence of association or the
      low power of individual studies. METHODS: We performed four meta-analyses,
      sequentially considering the two-, four-, and seven-repeat alleles as risk
      alleles, and then considering repeat length of the 48-base-pair segment as a risk
      factor. Each meta-analysis included at least 2,300 cases and 2,100 controls from 
      14-16 studies. RESULTS: The pooled odds ratio from each analysis approximated
      1.0, and none were significant. Heterogeneity was not observed, although gender
      moderated the effects of repeat length and the seven-repeat allele. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Despite over 90% power to detect a significant odds ratio of 1.4 or less, none
      was observed. This polymorphism seems not to influence risk for most
      schizophrenia cases; however, a sex-dependent relationship, or a role in some
      clinical features of the disorder, cannot be excluded and should be pursued
      experimentally.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of occupational therapy in patients with
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
PG  - 26-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is well established that the combination of psychopharmacological
      treatment and psychosocial interventions, such as psychotherapy, family
      orientation and occupational therapy (OT), represent the best strategy for
      treating patients with schizophrenia. However, in terms of treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia (TRS) almost only psychopharmacological treatments are available
      and psychosocial interventions such as OT had not proved to be effective. The aim
      of this study is to investigate if OT is effective when added to a
      psychopharmacological treatment in TRS. METHODS: Two groups of patients with TRS 
      were compared: The experimental group (EG) received psychopharmacological
      treatment with clozapine plus sessions of occupational therapy (OT) and the
      control group (CG) received only clozapine. The Scale for Interactive Observation
      in Occupational Therapy (EOITO) was employed to evaluate the outcome. The
      duration of the study was 6 months and patients were rated at baseline and
      monthly totaling 7 assessments. EOITO was independently applied by two
      occupational therapists with high reliability rates (Kappa=0.90, p=0.001).
      Repeated measures of analyses of variance and the evaluation of the standardized 
      effect sizes were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: The EG showed that the 
      OT intervention was effective along the whole period of observation, mainly from 
      the 4th month to the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with TRS the
      combination of OT and clozapine showed to be more effective than the use of
      clozapine alone. OT may represent an additional therapeutic option for patients
      with TRS.

TI  - Quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel): a new atypical antipsychotic.
PG  - 193-210
AB  - The goal of antipsychotic drug development efforts over the past 10 years has
      been to develop agents with increased efficacy and safety and fewer of the side
      effects commonly associated with the older antipsychotic medications. The newer
      agents, often called atypical antipsychotics, are effective in treating both the 
      positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and are associated with fewer
      neurological- and endocrine-related side effects compared to the older agents. As
      a result, patients are likely to remain on therapy longer, preventing relapses
      and costly hospitalizations. Quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) is the most recently 
      introduced atypical antipsychotic and is indicated for the management of the
      manifestations of psychotic disorders and schizophrenia. Quetiapine, like
      clozapine (the archetypal atypical antipsychotic), interacts with a broad range
      of neurotransmitter receptors and has a higher affinity for serotonin (5-HT(2A)) 
      receptors relative to dopamine (D(2)) receptors in the brain. Further,
      quetiapine's pharmacological effects appear selective for the mesolimbic and
      mesocortical dopamine systems, which are believed to be the areas of the brain
      responsible for the therapeutic effects of antipsychotics. In contrast to most
      standard antipsychotics and some atypical antipsychotics, quetiapine's effects on
      the nigrostriatal dopamine system, which is responsible for the extrapyramidal
      (or motor) side effects, are minimal. Quetiapine also has minimal activity on
      dopamine receptors in the tuberoinfundibular dopamine system, thereby avoiding
      the problem of hyperprolactinemia, common with the standard antipsychotics and
      some atypical antipsychotics. Because of these properties, quetiapine is an
      effective antipsychotic agent with a relatively benign side effect profile.
      Several large, placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter trials have shown
      quetiapine to be effective against both positive (e.g., hallucinations,
      delusions) and negative symptoms (e.g., emotional withdrawal, apathy) and to have
      benefits in reducing hostility, aggression and affective symptoms. Patients on
      long-term treatment report high compliance, good satisfaction, increased ability 
      to function and improvements consistent with a better quality of life. Because of
      quetiapine's excellent tolerability profile, its use is particularly appropriate 
      in patients especially sensitive to adverse effects, e.g., elderly patients with 
      psychotic symptoms and other neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and
      Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - An association study of a brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism
      and clozapine response of schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 206-8
AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests the involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor (BDNF) in both antipsychotic action and schizophrenia pathogenesis. The
      present study tested the hypothesis that the BDNF-gene Val66Met polymorphism is
      associated with schizophrenia and clozapine's therapeutic response. To identify
      any genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, we studied the BDNF-gene Val66Met
      polymorphism in 93 schizophrenic patients and 198 normal controls. Statistical
      analysis was used to test the association between this polymorphism and clozapine
      response the schizophrenic group. A trend (P=0.055) was demonstrated between
      genetic predisposition and Val66Met genotypes in 93 schizophrenic patients,
      especially for those with good response to clozapine (P=0.023). No significant
      difference in clozapine therapeutic response was demonstrated comparing the three
      Val66Met-genotype subgroups. Our finding suggests that this BDNF-gene Val66Met
      polymorphism may be related to schizophrenia pathogenesis in patients responsive 
      to clozapine treatment.

TI  - The safety and early efficacy of oral-loaded divalproex versus standard-titration
      divalproex, lithium, olanzapine, and placebo in the treatment of acute mania
      associated with bipolar disorder.
PG  - 841-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have examined the safety and tolerability of
      oral-loaded divalproex sodium in the treatment of acute mania, but not the early 
      efficacy of this dosing strategy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
      early efficacy of oral-loaded divalproex. METHOD: In this pooled analysis, 348
      subjects from 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active- or
      placebo-controlled studies were used to compare the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of oral-loaded divalproex with standard-titration divalproex,
      lithium, olanzapine, or placebo. Subjects were inpatients diagnosed with acute
      mania associated with bipolar I disorder (DSM-III-R or -IV and SADS-Change
      Version). Patients were administered oral-loaded divalproex (20 or 30 mg/kg/day
      on days 1 and 2 followed by 20 mg/kg/day, and increased at physician's
      discretion), standard-titration divalproex initiated at 250 mg t.i.d. and
      titrated to 40-150 microg/mL, lithium (300 mg t.i.d. initial dose) titrated to
      0.4 to 1.5 mEq/L, olanzapine (10 mg q.d. initial dose) up to 20 mg/day, or
      placebo. RESULTS: The results demonstrate an early efficacy advantage for
      oral-loaded divalproex compared to standard-titration divalproex at days 5, 7/8, 
      and 10. Efficacy was improved over lithium on day 7/8. There were no efficacy
      differences between divalproex loading and olanzapine. Divalproex loading showed 
      greater efficacy than placebo at all time points. Divalproex loading was as well 
      tolerated or better tolerated than the other active treatments as measured by
      adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: These results
      suggest the oral loading of divalproex leads to a more rapid antimanic effect
      when compared with standard-titration divalproex, lithium, or placebo and is
      better tolerated than olanzapine and as well tolerated as lithium or
      standard-titration divalproex.

TI  - An integrated analysis of acute treatment-emergent extrapyramidal syndrome in
      patients with schizophrenia during olanzapine clinical trials: comparisons with
      placebo, haloperidol, risperidone, or clozapine.
PG  - 898-906
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency and severity of extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) were
      evaluated in patients with DSM-III or DSM-IV schizophrenia in the acute phase (- 
      8 weeks) of randomized, double-blind, controlled trials from the integrated
      olanzapine clinical trial database. METHOD: This retrospective analysis included 
      23 clinical trials and 4611 patients from November 11, 1991, through July 31,
      2001. Incidences of dystonic, parkinsonian, and akathisia events were compared
      using treatment-emergent adverse-event data. Categorical analyses of
      Simpson-Angus Scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) scores, use of
      anticholinergic medications, and baseline-to-endpoint changes in Simpson-Angus
      Scale and BAS scores were compared. RESULTS: A significantly smaller percentage
      of olanzapine-treated patients experienced dystonic events than did haloperidol- 
      (p <.001) or risperidone-treated patients (p =.047). A significantly greater
      percentage of haloperidol-treated patients experienced parkinsonian (p <.001) and
      akathisia (p <.001) events than did olanzapine-treated patients. Categorical
      analysis of Simpson-Angus Scale scores showed significantly more haloperidol- (p 
      <.001) or risperidone-treated patients (p =.004) developed parkinsonism than did 
      olanzapine-treated patients. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced
      significantly greater reductions in Simpson-Angus Scale scores than did
      haloperidol- (p <.001), risperidone- (p <.001), or clozapine-treated (p =.032)
      patients. Categorical analysis of BAS scores showed significantly more
      haloperidol-treated patients experienced treatment-emergent akathisia versus
      olanzapine-treated patients (p <.001). Significantly greater reductions in BAS
      scores were experienced during olanzapine treatment versus placebo (p =.007),
      haloperidol (p <.001), and risperidone (p =.004) treatments. A significantly
      smaller percentage of olanzapine-treated patients received anticholinergic
      medications compared with that of haloperidol- (p <.001) or risperidone-treated
      patients (p =.018). Compared with that in olanzapine-treated patients, the
      duration of anticholinergic cotreatment was significantly longer among
      haloperidol- (p <.001) or risperidone-treated patients (p =.040) and
      significantly shorter among clozapine-treated patients (p =.021). CONCLUSION:
      This analysis of available data from olanzapine clinical trials lends additional 
      support to olanzapine's favorable EPS profile.

TI  - Augmenting atypical antipsychotics with a cognitive enhancer (donepezil) improves
      regional brain activity in schizophrenia patients: a pilot double-blind placebo
      controlled BOLD fMRI study.
PG  - 274-82
AB  - Cognitive impairments are cardinal features of schizophrenia and predictors of
      poor vocational and social outcome. Imaging studies with verbal fluency tasks
      (VFT) lead some to suggest that in schizophrenia, the combination of a failure to
      deactivate the left temporal lobe and a hypoactive frontal lobe reflects a
      functional disconnectivity between the left prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe. 
      Others have theorized that an abnormal cingulate gyrus modulates such
      fronto-temporal connectivity. Thus addition of a cognitive enhancing medication
      to current antipsychotic therapy might improve functionality of networks
      necessary in working memory and internal concept generation. To test this
      hypothesis, we serially measured brain activity in 6 subjects on stable atypical 
      antipsychotics performing a VFT, using BOLD fMRI. Measurements were made at
      baseline and again after groups were randomized to receive 12 weeks of donepezil 
      (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) and placebo in a blind cross-over design.
      Donepezil addition provided a functional normalization with an increase in left
      frontal lobe and cingulate activity when compared to placebo and from baseline
      scans. This pilot study supports the cingulate's role in modulating cognition and
      neuronal connectivity in schizophrenia.

TI  - Olanzapine for psychotic and behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 1321-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine for the treatment of
      psychotic and behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer disease. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE
      (1966-January 2003) and Science Citation Index searches were performed. Key
      search terms included olanzapine, Alzheimer(s), and dementia. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Four trials of olanzapine and subsequent post hoc analyses were reviewed. Three
      trials found a benefit associated with olanzapine use, but a fourth trial did
      not. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine appears to be effective in treating psychotic and
      behavioral disturbances associated with Alzheimer disease. However, the most
      appropriate dose remains to be determined. The benefit of olanzapine therapy must
      be weighed against the adverse effect profiles of olanzapine and alternative
      treatment options.

TI  - Management of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia: new treatment options.
PG  - 793-823
AB  - This article presents a systematic review of pharmacological treatment for
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia, based on MEDLINE searches from 1995 to
      September 2002 to identify pertinent clinical trials. The pharmacotherapy of
      negative symptoms in schizophrenia includes novel/atypical antipsychotics and
      classical antipsychotics, as well as antidepressants, glutamatergic compounds,
      antiepileptic drugs and estrogens. In the assessment of therapy for negative
      symptoms of schizophrenia, it is imperative that better studies of sound
      methodology are performed. In such studies, some important aspects to be
      considered include an accurate definition and assessment of negative symptoms
      (including well designed, valid and reliable rating scales), the differentiation 
      between primary and secondary negative symptoms, an appropriate selection of
      standard comparators, adequate dosages of comparators (e.g. haloperidol dosages) 
      and an overall optimal study design. Most of the available studies on treating
      negative symptoms in schizophrenia have focused on the atypical antipsychotics,
      while other potential candidates, mostly in the context of add-on therapy, have
      not been so intensively investigated. Atypical antipsychotics have been proven in
      placebo-controlled trials to be effective in treating negative symptoms of acute 
      schizophrenic episodes. In many of the comparator studies, they showed efficacy
      in treating negative symptoms that was superior to that of typical
      antipsychotics. Data on stable, predominant negative symptoms in subchronic or
      chronic cases of schizophrenia, although limited, have demonstrated the efficacy 
      of atypical antipsychotics. If the beneficial tolerability profile with respect
      to extrapyramidal symptoms is also taken into account during clinical decision
      making, the atypical antipsychotics should be preferred for the treatment of
      negative symptoms. It is also worth noting that the traditional antipsychotics
      have the risk of inducing negative symptoms in the context of akinesia. The
      benefits of add-on therapy with SSRIs or a glutamatergic compound are well
      documented. Estrogen add-on therapy seems promising. Other traditionally
      suggested approaches, such as comedication with an antiepileptic drug, lithium or
      beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, cannot generally be recommended on the basis of the

TI  - Actigraphic measurement of the effects of single-dose haloperidol and olanzapine 
      on spontaneous motor activity in normal subjects.
PG  - 293-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively examine the effects of haloperidol and olanzapine on
      spontaneous motor activity in normal subjects. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled medication study. PARTICIPANTS: Normal volunteers (n = 30).
      INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received 1 dose of either haloperidol 2 mg (n = 9),
      olanzapine 10 mg (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) and were admitted to hospital for
      the next 24 hours. OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects wore an actigraphic monitor, which 
      recorded movement in 15-second epochs. The Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side
      Effect Scale (SAS) and the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) were administered before 
      and 7 and 24 hours after medication was given. RESULTS: Compared with placebo,
      total motor activity was decreased by 41% with olanzapine (p = 0.004) and by 12% 
      with haloperidol (NS). There were significantly more epochs with zero movement
      with olanzapine than with haloperidol or placebo. For non-zero epochs, the mean
      activity count and the distribution of activity counts did not differ
      significantly among groups. There were no positive findings on the SAS or the
      BAS. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine decreased total motor activity by increasing the
      amount of time during which subjects were immobile, rather than by affecting the 
      magnitude of movement during periods in which there was activity. This effect
      occurred at a dose of olanzapine low enough not to cause clinically observed
      extrapyramidal side effects. Our results suggest that actigraphy is useful as a
      sensitive, noninvasive tool for measuring the effect of antipsychotics on
      spontaneous motor activity.

TI  - Olanzapine versus placebo in acute mania: treatment responses in subgroups.
PG  - 370-6
AB  - Two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of olanzapine in acute mania showed
      significant overall antimanic efficacy, based on reductions in mania ratings.
      Their subject-level data were pooled to increase statistical power to test for
      differences in treatment responses among 10 subgroup pairs of interest using
      generalized estimating equations methods. Similar drug/placebo superiority and
      responsiveness to olanzapine was found in men versus women, psychotic versus
      nonpsychotic subjects, and those presenting in mania versus mixed states, and
      responses were independent of onset age, current age, or prior illness based on
      episodes, hospitalizations, recent rapid cycling, lifetime substance use, or
      previous antipsychotic treatment. Olanzapine and placebo responses paralleled
      closely (r(s) = 0.73). Patients were relatively more responsive to olanzapine who
      were younger at illness onset, lacked prior substance abuse, and had not
      previously received antipsychotic treatment (efficacy ratios 1.5-1.7, all P <
      0.01). These well-powered comparisons of subgroups of interest indicate broad
      efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania.

TI  - Effectiveness of rapid initial dose escalation of up to forty milligrams per day 
      of oral olanzapine in acute agitation.
PG  - 342-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients experiencing an acute decompensation of schizophrenia or
      bipolar disorder often present in an agitated state. Agitation presents a barrier
      to therapy, interrupting the typical physician-patient alliance and creating a
      disruptive, even hazardous, environment. Rapid assessment and effective treatment
      are necessary to manage agitation and, potentially, to shorten the time to
      recovery. METHODS: One hundred forty-eight acutely agitated patients received
      either: rapid initial dose escalation (RIDE) in which up to 40 mg of oral
      olanzapine was allowed on days 1 and 2, up to 30 mg on days 3 and 4, and 5 to 20 
      mg thereafter; or usual clinical practice (UCP) in which patients received 10
      mg/d olanzapine plus up to 4 mg lorazepam on days 1 and 2, up to 2 mg on days 3
      and 4, and olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d thereafter. The Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC: poor impulse control, tension, hostility,
      uncooperativeness, and excitement) measured at 24 hours was the primary measure. 
      Secondary assessments of agitation and safety were also performed. RESULTS:
      Agitation improved significantly from baseline for both treatment groups;
      however, improvement with the RIDE strategy was superior to UCP. The RIDE group
      improvement was superior on the primary efficacy measure (PANSS-Excited) at 24
      hours; it was superior on all agitation measures at the end of double-blind
      treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated, with no clinically significant
      differences in safety measures. Treatment was not limited by oversedation and
      attention improved from baseline in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      demonstrates the value of olanzapine in the treatment of acutely agitated
      patients. A new approach to olanzapine dosing that expands the initial dose range
      up to 40 mg/d may offer superior efficacy in rapidly and effectively controlling 
      the symptoms of agitation.

TI  - Serum antimuscarinic activity during clozapine treatment.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - This study attempts: (1) to verify that serum antimuscarinic activity is related 
      to clozapine dose, and more importantly to clozapine plasma concentrations; (2)
      to explore whether norclozapine has serum antimuscarinic activity; (3) to explore
      whether antimuscarinic activity is related to clozapine side effects; and (4) to 
      compare the serum antimuscarinic activities of clozapine with those of
      antiparkinsonian drugs and other antipsychotics. In 39 patients participating in 
      a double-blind clozapine study, the [3H]QNB assay was used to measure serum
      antimuscarinic activity: (1) on baseline medications; (2) after a 4-week
      haloperidol trial; (3) after a 16-week clozapine trial of either 100, 300, or 600
      mg/d; and (4) after 1 or 2 consecutive 16-week clozapine trials with remaining
      doses in nonresponders. Clozapine levels predicted serum antimuscarinic activity 
      better than clozapine dose. At the end of the 1st clozapine trial, the
      correlation with the levels explained 69% of the variance of serum antimuscarinic
      activity (r = 0.83, P < 0.001, N = 34). Clozapine levels were good predictors of 
      serum antimuscarinic activity only in patients taking 300 or 600 mg/d. After
      correcting for clozapine levels, the within-subject correlation between
      norclozapine levels and serum antimuscarinic activity was relatively high and
      significant (r = 0.54, F = 26.7, df = 1.65, P < 0.001). Constipation was
      significantly associated with higher serum antimuscarinic activity during the 1st
      clozapine trial. Clozapine was associated with clearly higher antimuscarinic
      activity than other antipsychotics or low doses of antiparkinsonians. In vitro
      studies and new clinical studies are needed to verify whether norclozapine may
      significantly contribute to antimuscarinic activity during clozapine treatment.

TI  - Generating evidence to inform policy and practice: the example of the second
      generation "atypical" antipsychotics.
PG  - 105-14
AB  - The introduction of the second generation "atypical" antipsychotics has been
      heralded as a major advance in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic
      disorders. Systematic reviews have revealed only modest advantages over
      conventional antipsychotics and uncertainty about long-term efficacy and safety, 
      yet the second generation antipsychotic drugs have been widely accepted into
      clinical practice. Although the existing evidence of the benefits and harms of
      atypical antipsychotics can facilitate decision making about individual patients,
      the randomized evidence remains inadequate to make valid and fully evidence-based
      policy statements such as clinical practice guidelines that are designed to apply
      to groups of patients. Further large randomized trials are needed, but these
      require patients and clinicians to be in equipoise, or substantially uncertain,
      about alternative therapies. Premature clinical practice guidelines or expert
      opinion can lead to changes in clinical practice that make it difficult or
      impossible to conduct the required trials and are therefore a disservice to
      patients.

TI  - Changing environments and alternative perspectives in evaluating the
      cost-effectiveness of new antipsychotic drugs.
PG  - 81-93
AB  - This article examines the ways in which changes in the treatment environment and 
      in measurement perspectives can affect the evaluation of cost-effectiveness of
      new medications. In three studies we reexamined data from a clinical trial of
      haloperidol and clozapine conducted from 1993 to 1996. The results of the studies
      are as follows: Study 1 found that clozapine treatment was associated with
      significantly reduced inpatient costs, and increased outpatient costs, suggesting
      that as systems use less inpatient care and more outpatient care, more effective 
      medications may increase, rather than decrease, costs in sicker patients. Study 2
      found that while provider assessments and standard measures favored clozapine
      over haloperidol, patient responses showed little evidence of a clinical
      advantage for clozapine and a less favorable side-effect profile. Study 3 found
      that while annual drug costs in the published trial were estimated to be dollars 
      4,545 for a full year of clozapine treatment, atypical antipsychotic costs in
      2000 were estimated to range from dollars 1,254 to dollars 3,016 in the
      Department of Veterans Affairs system, and from dollars 2,221 to dollars 8,147 in
      the private sector. In conclusion, cost-effectiveness, as evaluated in studies
      like CATIE, will increasingly need to be tied to service system contingencies,
      environments, and evaluation perspectives.

TI  - Quetiapine in the successful treatment of schizophrenia with comorbid alcohol and
      drug dependence: a case report.
PG  - 85-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excluding nicotine and caffeine dependence, almost 50% of individuals
      with schizophrenia also meet the criteria for substance abuse or dependence.
      Comorbid drug abuse presents complications to the effective treatment of these
      patients because they have increased psychotic symptoms and poorer treatment
      compliance. CASE REPORT: This report describes thecase of a young man with
      schizophrenia and comorbid alcohol and cocaine abuse who was successfully treated
      with quetiapine. The patient was previously treated with olanzapine and developed
      priapism, which required emergency medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The possible
      utility of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia and comorbid substance abuse needs to be confirmed in clinical
      trials.

TI  - The relationship of clozapine and haloperidol treatment response to prefrontal,
      hippocampal, and caudate brain volumes.
PG  - 1421-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to assess the predictive relationship between
      brain structure volume and positive and negative symptom response to clozapine
      and haloperidol. METHOD: Partially responsive outpatients with schizophrenia who 
      participated in a 10-week, parallel-group, double-blind comparison of clozapine
      and haloperidol and who had an available magnetic resonance imaging scan were
      included in the current study. Prefrontal gray and white matter, hippocampal, and
      caudate volumes were manually measured. The Scale for the Assessment of Negative 
      Symptoms (SANS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were used to assess
      symptom changes. The Simpson-Angus Rating Scale was used to assess extrapyramidal
      symptoms. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients randomly assigned to clozapine and 23
      patients assigned to haloperidol met study entry criteria. There were significant
      interactions between treatment and right prefrontal gray matter volume for BPRS
      total score and SANS total score. There were no significant treatment-by-brain
      structure interactions for BPRS positive symptom items. Right prefrontal gray
      matter volume was also related to differential treatment effects for the BPRS
      subscales of anxiety/depression and hostility and the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale 
      akathisia item. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there is a differential
      interaction among clozapine and haloperidol, brain structure, and treatment
      response. Partially responsive patients with larger brain volumes may be more
      likely to experience the benefits of clozapine treatment, but they may be more
      vulnerable to side effects and experience a subsequent worsening of their
      symptoms when treated with haloperidol.

TI  - Clozapine v. conventional antipsychotic drugs for treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia: a re-examination.
PG  - 161-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there is a consensus that clozapine is more effective than
      conventional antipsychotic drugs for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, there is 
      great heterogeneity among results of relevant trials. AIMS: To re-evaluate the
      evidence comparing clozapine with conventional antipsychotics and to investigate 
      sources of heterogeneity. METHOD: Individual studies were inspected with
      assessment of clinical relevance of results. Meta-regression analysis was
      performed to investigate sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Ten trials were
      examined. Recent large-scale studies have not found a substantial advantage for
      clozapine, especially in terms of a clinically relevant effect. Meta-regression
      showed that shorter study duration, financial support from a drug company and
      higher baseline symptom score consistently predicted greater advantage of
      clozapine. CONCLUSIONS: It may be inappropriate to combine studies in
      meta-analysis, given the degree of heterogeneity between their findings. The
      benefits of clozapine compared with conventional treatment may not be
      substantial.

TI  - Vitamin E treatment for tardive dyskinesia. Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study
      #394 Study Group.
PG  - 836-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several short-term, controlled trials have documented the efficacy of
      vitamin E in treating tardive dyskinesia. However, the persistent nature of the
      disease prompted us to perform a multicenter, longer-term trial of vitamin E.
      METHODS: The study was a prospective, randomized, 9-site trial of up to 2 years
      of treatment with d-vitamin E (1600 IU/d) vs matching placebo. One hundred
      fifty-eight subjects with tardive dyskinesia who were receiving neuroleptic
      medications were enrolled. The blinded assessments performed were clinical
      (Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, and Modified
      Simpson-Angus [for Extrapyramidal Symptoms] Scale) and electromechanical
      assessments of movement disorders, psychiatric status (Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale), and functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning). There were no
      significant differences in baseline demographic characteristics or in study
      assessments between the group that received vitamin E and the group that received
      placebo. RESULTS: Vitamin E was well tolerated and subject compliance with
      medication was good and similar between treatment groups. One hundred seven
      subjects (70% of those receiving vitamin E and 66% of subjects receiving placebo)
      completed at least 1 year of treatment. There were no significant effects of
      vitamin E on total scores or subscale scores for the AIMS, electromechanical
      measures of dyskinesia, or scores from the other 4 scales. CONCLUSION: This
      long-term, randomized trial of vitamin E vs placebo found no evidence for
      efficacy of vitamin E in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia.

TI  - Olanzapine reduces craving for alcohol: a DRD4 VNTR polymorphism by
      pharmacotherapy interaction.
PG  - 1882-8
AB  - Separate investigations have suggested that olanzapine, a D4 antagonist,
      decreases craving after a priming dose of alcohol and that the DRD4 variable
      number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism influences the expression of craving
      after a priming dose of alcohol. The present study tested the hypothesis that
      olanzapine may be differentially effective at reducing cue-elicited craving based
      on individual differences in DRD4 VNTR in a sample of heavy social drinkers.
      Participants were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (5 mg) or a control
      medication (cyproheptadine, 4 mg) prior to consuming three alcoholic drinks.
      Participants completed subjective measures of craving and euphoria after each
      drink. Participants who were homozygous or heterozygous for the 7 (or longer)
      repeat allele of the DRD4 VNTR were classified as DRD4 L, while the other
      participants were classified as DRD4 S. The findings indicated that olanzapine
      reduces craving for alcohol at baseline for both DRD4 S and DRD4 L individuals,
      but only reduces craving after exposure to alcohol cues and after a priming dose 
      of alcohol for DRD4 L individuals.

TI  - [Comparative bioavailability study of two formulations of risperidone available
      in the Chilean market].
PG  - 527-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioavailability of a particular drug can vary according to the
      formulation used. Therefore, studies of comparative bioavailability of different 
      formulations of a same drug are worthwhile. AIM: To compare the bioavailability
      of two risperidone formulations available in the Chilean market. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: The bioavailability of a local risperidone formulation (Spiron) was
      compared with the original formulation of the drug (Risperdal) in 12 healthy
      volunteers, aged 19 +/- 1 years. A single dose of 3 mg was given orally, using a 
      randomized double blind protocol in two periods. Fifteen blood samples were
      obtained at regular intervals, until 24 h after drug administration. Risperidone 
      plasma levels were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography.
      pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a computer program that is
      independent of compartmental analysis. RESULTS: The area under the curve of
      plasma concentration versus time, from 0 to infinite (ABC0-infinity) and from 0
      to 24 h (ABC0-24), early exposure (ABC from 0 to maximal time) and maximal plasma
      concentrations were significantly lower for Spiron. Half life time and time to
      achieve the maximal concentration were similar for the two formulations.
      CONCLUSIONS: According to bioequivalence tests suggested by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) of the United States (90% confidence interval for the
      difference of long transformed mean pharmacokinetic parameters), the formulations
      Risperdal and Spiron, cannot be considered interchangeable.

TI  - A comparison of the efficacy and safety of olanzapine versus haloperidol during
      transition from intramuscular to oral therapy.
PG  - 1420-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia who receive
      intramuscular (IM) medications typically are switched to oral (PO) antipsychotic 
      maintenance therapy. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy
      and safety of olanzapine versus those of haloperidol during transition from IM to
      PO therapy. We used additional data from a previously reported trial to test the 
      hypothesis that the reduction in agitation achieved by IM olanzapine 10 mg or IM 
      haloperidol 7.5 mg would be maintained following transition to 4 days of PO
      olanzapine or PO haloperidol (5-20 mg/d for both). We also hypothesized that
      olanzapine would maintain its more favorable extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) safety 
      profile. METHODS: This was a multinational (hospitals in 13 countries),
      double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Acutely agitated inpatients with
      schizophrenia were treated with 1 to 3 IM injections to olanzapine 10 mg or
      haloperidol 7.5 mg over 24 hours and were entered into a 4-day PO treatment
      period with the same medication (5-20 mg/d for both). The primary efficacy
      measurement was reduction in agitation, as measured by the Positive and Negative 
      Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC) score. Adverse events and scores on
      EPS rating scales were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 311 patients (204 men, 107
      women; mean [SD] age, 38.2 [11.6] years) were enrolled (131, 126, and 54 patients
      in the olanzapine, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively). In all, 93.1% 
      (122/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 92.1% (116/126) of
      haloperidol-treated patients completed the IM period and entered the PO period;
      85.5% (112/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 84.1% (106/126) of
      haloperidol-treated patients completed the PO period. IM olanzapine and IM
      haloperidol effectively reduced agitation over 24 hours (mean [SD] PANSS-EC
      change, -7.1 [4.81 vs -6.7 [4.3], respectively). Reductions in agitation were
      sustained throughout the PO period with both study drugs (mean [SD] change from
      PO period baseline, -0.6 [4.8] vs -1.3 [4.4], respectively). During PO treatment,
      haloperidol-treated patients spontaneously reported significantly more acute
      dystonia than olanzapine-treated patients (4.3%[5/116] vs 0% [0/122],
      respectively; P = 0.026) and akathisia (5.2% [6/116] vs 0% [0/122], respectively;
      P = 0.013). Significantly more haloperidol-treated patients than
      olanzapine-treated patients met categorical criteria for treatment-emergent
      akathisia (18.5% [17/92] vs 6.5% [7/107], respectively; P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: 
      In the acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia in this study, both IM
      olanzapine 10 mg and IM haloperidol 7.5 mg effectively reduced agitation over 24 
      hours. This alleviation of agitation was sustained following transition from IM
      therapy to 4 days of PO treatment (5-20 mg/d for both). During the 4 days of PO
      treatment, olanzapine-treated patients did not spontaneously report any
      incidences of acute dystonia, and olanzapine had a superior EPS safety profile to
      that of haloperidol. The combination of IM and PO olanzapine may help improve the
      treatment of acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Aripiprazole, an antipsychotic with a novel mechanism of action, and risperidone 
      vs placebo in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 681-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 receptor partial agonist with partial
      agonist activity at serotonin 5HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5HT2A
      receptors. This multicenter trial examined the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of aripiprazole in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. METHODS: In this 4-week double-blind study, 404
      patients were randomized to 20 mg/d (n = 101) or 30 mg/d (n = 101) of
      aripiprazole, placebo (n = 103), or 6 mg/d of risperidone (n = 99). Efficacy
      assessments included Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and
      Clinical Global Impression scores. Safety and tolerability evaluations included
      extrapyramidal symptoms and effects on weight, prolactin, and corrected QT (QTc) 
      interval. RESULTS: Aripiprazole (20 and 30 mg/d) and risperidone (6 mg/d) were
      significantly better than placebo on all efficacy measures. Separation from
      placebo occurred at week 1 for PANSS total and positive scores with aripiprazole 
      and risperidone and for PANSS negative scores with aripiprazole. There were no
      significant differences between aripiprazole and placebo in mean change from
      baseline in the extrapyramidal symptom rating scales. Mean prolactin levels
      decreased with aripiprazole but significantly increased 5-fold with risperidone. 
      Mean change in QTc interval did not differ significantly from placebo with any
      active treatment group. Aripiprazole and risperidone groups showed a similar low 
      incidence of clinically significant weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Aripiprazole is
      effective, safe, and well tolerated for the positive and negative symptoms in
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. It is the first non-D2 receptor
      antagonist with clear antipsychotic effects and represents a novel treatment
      development for psychotic disorders.

TI  - Olanzapine for intractable nausea in palliative care patients.
PG  - 251-5
AB  - Nausea is a common problem among palliative care patients, which is often
      undertreated. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, possesses a unique
      neurotransmitter binding profile that is similar to methotrimeprazine, an
      anti-emetic widely used in Europe for recalcitrant nausea. We report a case
      series of six patients who suffered nausea which was resistant to initial
      treatment with traditional antiemetics; each patient exhibited marked improvement
      when treated with olanzapine.

TI  - Treatment for delirium with risperidone: results of a prospective open trial with
      10 patients.
PG  - 289-92
AB  - Delirium is a common psychiatric illness among medically compromised patients.
      There is an increasing opportunity to use atypical antipsychotics to treat
      delirium. The effects of these drugs on delirium, however, the most appropriate
      way to use them, and the associated adverse effects remain unclear. To clarify
      these points, a prospective open trial on risperidone was carried out in 10
      patients with delirium. At a low dose of 1.7 mg/d, on average, risperidone was
      effective in 80% of patients, and the effect appeared within a few days. There
      were no serious adverse effects. However, sleepiness (30%) and mild drug-induced 
      parkinsonism (10%) were observed; the symptom of sleepiness was a reason for not 
      increasing the dose. One patient responded to a dose as low as 0.5 mg/d, so it is
      recommended that treatment start at a low dose, which may then be increased
      gradually. This trial is a preliminary open study with a small sample size, and
      further controlled studies will be necessary.

TI  - [Benzodiazepines, typical and atypical antipsychotics in the management of acute 
      agitation: a review].
PG  - 134-44
AB  - Given the diversity of clinical entities from which agitation may arise, it is
      not surprising that it is among the most commonly encountered clinical problems
      in psychiatric facilities and hospital emergency services. However, quite
      surprisingly this area has received very little attention and has not been
      studied in clinical trials until recently. Thus, tremendous variability exists in
      approaches to agitation. In this work, we review what is known about the
      pharmacologic management of agitation; first, by examining published studies
      comparing conventional antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and/or a combination of
      both to achieve calm in acutely agitated psychiatric patients; and second, by
      reviewing available data on the use of atypical antipsychotic medications for the
      acute treatment of agitation associated with psychiatric illness. In our first
      review, we identified 11 trials meeting our inclusion criteria, 8 with a blind
      design. These studies taken together suggest that combination treatment may be
      superior to either agent alone, with higher improvement rates and lower incidence
      of extrapyramidal side effects. In our review of atypical antipsychotic agents as
      acute antiagitation compounds, we identified 5 studies, 3 with a blind design.
      This review found atypical antipsychotics to be as effective as the classical
      ones and more advantageous. Based on the data available to date, among the
      present novel antipsychotic agents, ziprasidone, risperidone, and olanzapine seem
      to be the best acute antiagitation compounds.

TI  - Clozapine: a clinical review of adverse effects and management.
PG  - 33-48
AB  - Clozapine (Clozaril) is a novel and unique prototype atypical, tricyclic,
      dibenzodiazepine-derivative, antipsychotic agent. It has been proven effective
      and significantly superior to placebo, as well as to conventional neuroleptics,
      in several placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. It has also been found to produce an incidence of extrapyramidal
      symptoms (EPS) as low as that found with placebo. Approximately 30-60% of all
      schizophrenic patients who fail to respond to typical antipsychotics may respond 
      to clozapine. It was the first major advance that marked a turning point in the
      treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders since the introduction
      of the typical antipsychotic agents, i.e., chlorpromazine and haloperidol in the 
      1950s and 1960s, respectively. After its introduction in clinical studies in the 
      United States in the early 1970s, it was withdrawn in 1974, and was not approved 
      for clinical use in the United States until February 1990, because of the risk of
      agranulocytosis. Its novel pharmacological profile, lack of propensity to cause
      EPS in both short- and long-term uses, lack of effects on serum prolactin, and
      ameliorative effects on tardive dyskinesia have resulted in the expansion of its 
      use from refractory schizophrenia to schizoaffective disorders, affective
      disorders, some neurological disorders, aggression, as well as psychosis in
      patients with dementia and parkinsonism. This review covers the history,
      pharmacology, management of side effects, and fetal and neonatal effects of
      clozapine.

TI  - Psychosis of Alzheimer disease: validity of the construct and response to
      risperidone.
PG  - 414-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the efficacy of risperidone in reducing
      psychotic and aggressive symptoms in a subgroup of patients who fulfilled
      operationalized criteria for psychosis of dementia. METHODS: Authors conducted a 
      subgroup analysis of patients in the risperidone database arising from a previous
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. In the primary study,
      patients age 55 or older, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and/or
      vascular dementia were randomized to placebo or 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, or 2.0 mg/day of 
      risperidone. For this analysis, patients were selected who fulfilled
      operationalized criteria for psychosis of dementia. These criteria were then
      validated. The primary outcome measures were the newly developed Psychosis and
      Aggression Severity Indices, derived from Parts 1 and 2 of the BEHAVE-AD rating
      scale. RESULTS: At Week 12 and endpoint, patients with psychosis of dementia
      receiving 1 mg or 2 mg/day of risperidone showed significantly more improvement
      on the Psychosis Severity and Aggressiveness Severity Indices than those
      receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The construct of psychosis of dementia was
      validated, and the severity of both psychosis and aggressiveness was reduced with
      risperidone treatment in a robust and dose-related way, with a continuing
      response over the 12-week trial period.

TI  - The effects of antipsychotic drug treatment on prolactin concentrations in
      elderly patients.
PG  - 189-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the change in serum prolactin concentrations in elderly
      agitated nursing home patients with dementia who were newly initiated on
      olanzapine or switched to olanzapine treatment from either conventional
      antipsychotics or risperidone. METHODS: During an 8-week open-label olanzapine
      efficacy trial in elderly nursing home patients demonstrating clinically
      significant behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, serum prolactin
      concentrations were drawn on four occasions: at time of consent, following a
      washout period from previous therapy, midway through the study, and at endpoint. 
      To assess post-hoc the effects of prolactin concentrations upon switching to
      olanzapine treatment, patients were divided into three different groups, based
      upon status at time of consent: those not taking antipsychotic medication, those 
      taking any conventional antipsychotic, and those taking risperidone. Prolactin
      concentrations were assessed using a mixed-effect repeated-measures model.
      Symptom severity was measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS),
      the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Clinical Global Impression
      (CGI)-Severity scale, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the same 
      repeated measures analysis was performed on these scales. RESULTS: Patients not
      on antipsychotic medication at study entry (29 females, 7 males) experienced a
      significant increase in prolactin concentration baseline to endpoint (P < 0.05)
      but remained below upper limit of normal for prolactin for both males and
      females. There was a nonsignificant increase in prolactin concentrations when
      patients were switched from conventional antipsychotic medications (mean dose
      152.41 +/- 192.48 mg/day chlorpromazine equivalents) to olanzapine (2.5 to 10
      mg/day) (22 females, 9 males). Patients who entered the study on risperidone
      (mean dose 1.31 +/- 0.91 mg/day) (13 females, 4 males) experienced a significant 
      decrease in prolactin concentration (P < 0.001). While 62.5% of
      risperidone-treated patients had above-normal prolactin concentrations at
      baseline, only 21.4% had above-normal concentrations at endpoint (P = 0.033).
      Clear correlations between prolactin concentrations and clinical outcomes could
      not be determined. CONCLUSION: Consistent with previous findings in younger
      patients, olanzapine appeared to be a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic medication 
      in the elderly with only modest prolactin increases observed. In addition,
      patients who were receiving risperidone and then switched to olanzapine
      experienced a significant reduction in prolactin concentrations that was
      sustained over the 8-week treatment course with olanzapine. One possible
      explanation for olanzapine's relatively modest increase in prolactin is that,
      unlike conventionals or risperidone, olanzapine binds less tightly with the
      dopamine D(2) receptor.

TI  - Efficacy of low-dose mirtazapine in neuroleptic-induced akathisia: a double-blind
      randomized placebo-controlled pilot study.
PG  - 305-8
AB  - The nonselective serotonin (5-HT)-2A antagonists ritanserin, mianserin, and
      cyproheptadine were found efficacious in neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA).
      Mirtazapine is structurally and pharmacologically similar to mianserin, and the
      authors sought to determine its anti-NIA activity. Twenty-six neuroleptic-treated
      schizophrenic patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of NIA received add-on mirtazapine
      (15 mg/day) or placebo for 5 days in a double-blind design. Patients were
      assessed at baseline and days 3 and 5 with the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS),
      Positive and Negative Symptom Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and
      Simpson-Angus Scale for parkinsonism. Analysis of covariance with repeated
      measurements revealed significant group x time effects in favor of the
      mirtazapine group in both completers (n = 10 in each group) and intent-to-treat
      analysis (n = 13 in each group) for the BAS global subscale (F [1, 17] = 14.87, p
      = 0.001, and F [1, 23] = 13.24, p = 0.01, respectively) and objective subscale (F
      [1, 17] = 8.25, p = 0.011, and F [1, 23] = 7.35, p = 0.012, respectively) and
      borderline significant superiority for the BAS subjective subscale (F [1, 17] =
      4.39, p = 0.051, and F [1, 23] = 4.12, p = 0.054, respectively) and distress
      subscale (F [1, 17] = 4.21, p = 0.056, and F [1, 23] = 3.80, p = 0.064,
      respectively). Significantly more mirtazapine-than placebo-treated patients
      (53.8% [7/13] vs. 7.7% [1/13], respectively; chi2 = 8.3, p = 0.004) met
      operational response criterion, a reduction of at least two points on the BAS
      global subscale. Mirtazapine treatment was associated with modest improvement of 
      psychotic and parkinsonian symptoms. Mild sedation was the only side effect. Our 
      study demonstrated that mirtazapine (15 mg/day) is an efficacious and
      well-tolerated therapeutic option in NIA. Marked 5HT2A/2C antagonistic activity
      of mirtazapine apparently accounts for its anti-NIA activity. The role of
      mirtazapine in the treatment of akathisia induced by atypical antipsychotic
      agents merits further investigation.

TI  - Tolerability and efficacy of clozapine combined with lithium in schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 223-8
AB  - The safety and tolerability of clozapine combined with lithium were investigated 
      because of potential additive risks as well as frequent usage in clinical
      practice. Ten hospitalized schizophrenic and 10 schizoaffective patients
      receiving clozapine maintenance therapy with partial therapeutic response were
      studied in a randomized controlled trial. CGI and PANSS outcome ratings were
      employed and a cognitive battery was administered at baseline and after 4 weeks
      of lithium and placebo administration. Barnes and UKU side effect ratings and
      laboratory safety data were obtained. Combined lithium-clozapine treatment was
      well tolerated except for reversible neurotoxic reactions in two schizophrenic
      patients. Safety measures showed no significant variations, even during lithium
      toxicity. Total WBC and absolute granulocyte counts increased with lithium and
      declined with placebo. Schizoaffective patients improved with lithium on CGI and 
      PANSS total and negative symptom scales and the cognitive measures, whereas
      schizophrenic patients did not. Lithium added to clozapine in treatment regimens 
      for hospitalized, treatment-resistant, schizoaffective patients appears to afford
      potential benefit without harmful effects; for schizophrenic patients, however,
      it did not afford improvement but posed a risk of lithium toxicity.

TI  - Chlorpromazine equivalent doses for the newer atypical antipsychotics.
PG  - 663-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several clinical and research applications require an estimation of
      therapeutic dose equivalence across antipsychotic medications. Since the advent
      of the newer atypical antipsychotics, new dose equivalent estimations have been
      needed. METHOD: The reported minimum effective dose was identified for each newer
      atypical antipsychotic medication and for haloperidol across all available
      fixed-dose placebo-controlled studies. Reported minimum effective dose
      equivalence ratios to haloperidol were then converted to chlorpromazine
      equivalents using the "2 mg of haloperidol equals 100 mg of chlorpromazine"
      convention. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: To identify the fixed-dose studies,
      the following sources were searched until June 2002: MEDLINE, the bibliographies 
      of identified reports, published meta-analyses and reviews, Cochrane reviews,
      Freedom of Information Act material available from the Food and Drug
      Administration, and abstracts from several scientific meetings from 1997 to 2002.
      RESULTS: Doses equivalent to 100 mg/day of chlorpromazine were 2 mg/day for
      risperidone, 5 mg/day for olanzapine, 75 mg/day for quetiapine, 60 mg/day for
      ziprasidone, and 7.5 mg/day for aripiprazole. CONCLUSION: These equivalency
      estimates may be useful for clinical and research purposes. The source of the
      dose equivalency estimation is evidence-based and consistent across medication.

TI  - Ethnic differences in use of antipsychotic medication among Texas medicaid
      clients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 635-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Culture and ethnicity have been suggested to influence the
      presentation of patients with schizophrenia. These factors are thought to affect 
      the diagnoses, courses of treatment, and medical utilization patterns of patients
      with schizophrenia. Specifically, the differences between whites, African
      Americans, and Mexican Americans are of particular importance, as these groups
      comprise the majority of the population in the United States today. The
      traditional course of treatment for many patients with schizophrenia is the drug 
      haloperidol. However, research has shown that some ethnic groups (African
      Americans and Mexican Americans) may respond better to atypical drugs, such as
      olanzapine, but may be less likely to receive these drugs. A better response to
      the course of treatment results in improved medical utilization patterns. The
      purpose of this study was to examine if ethnicity helped predict whether Texas
      Medicaid patients were prescribed haloperidol versus olanzapine when other
      factors were controlled for. METHOD: The study population consisted of 726
      patients whose index drug was haloperidol and 1875 patients whose index drug was 
      olanzapine. Patients had an ICD-9-CM diagnosis of schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. Texas medical and prescription claims data were used in
      a logistic regression analysis to determine significant predictors of the type of
      antipsychotic (haloperidol vs. olanzapine) patients were prescribed. Variables
      included in the analysis were ethnicity, gender, age, region, other mental
      illness comorbidities, and previous utilization of medications and resources.
      Data were collected from Jan. 1, 1996, to Aug. 31, 1998. RESULTS: The results
      show that when other demographic and utilization factors were controlled for,
      African Americans were less likely than whites to receive olanzapine rather than 
      haloperidol. CONCLUSION: Ethnicity is a significant predictor of the type of
      antipsychotic that is prescribed.

TI  - Risperidone-associated diabetes mellitus: a pharmacovigilance study.
PG  - 735-44
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics of hyperglycemia in
      patients treated with risperidone. DESIGN: Pharmacovigilance survey of
      spontaneously reported adverse events in risperidone-treated patients, with
      reports of haloperidol-associated hyperglycemia used as a control. SETTING:
      Government-affiliated drug evaluation center. INTERVENTION: The Food and Drug
      Administration MedWatch surveillance program was queried (risperidone,
      1993-February 2002; haloperidol, late 1970s-February 2002) and results pooled
      with published cases. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 131 reports of
      risperidone-associated hyperglycemia in addition to seven reports of patients
      with hyperglycemia who received combined risperidone-haloperidol therapy and six 
      reports of acidosis that occurred in the absence of hyperglycemia. We found 13
      reports of haloperidol-associated hyperglycemia and 11 reports of acidosis
      without hyperglycemia. Of the reports of risperidone-associated hyperglycemia
      (monotherapy), 78 patients had newly diagnosed hyperglycemia, 46 had exacerbated 
      preexisting diabetes, and 7 could not be classified. Mean +/- SD age was 39.8 +/-
      17.4 years (range 8-96 yrs). Patients with new-onset diabetes (mean +/- SD age
      34.8 +/- 15.7 yrs) were younger than those with preexisting diabetes (mean +/- SD
      age 48.8 +/- 17.5 yrs). The overall male:female ratio was 1.5. In most patients, 
      hyperglycemia appeared within 3 months of the start of risperidone therapy.
      Severity of disease ranged from mild glucose intolerance to diabetic ketoacidosis
      or hyperosmolar coma. Twenty-six patients with acidosis or ketosis were reported.
      Four patients died. CONCLUSION: Atypical antipsychotic treatment may unmask or
      precipitate hyperglycemia. Although such cases attributed to clozapine or
      olanzapine are more numerous than those associated with risperidone, the number
      for risperidone-associated hyperglycemia is relatively higher than that observed 
      with the conventional neuroleptic haloperidol.

TI  - Risperidone in acute and continuation treatment of mania.
PG  - 227-35
AB  - In a prospective study, we examined the efficacy of risperidone added-on to mood 
      stabilizers in the acute and continuation treatment of mania over a 12-week
      period. Patients (n=108) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic or
      mixed episode requiring treatment with an antipsychotic were recruited. All
      subjects were on one or two mood stabilizers at the time of initiation of
      risperidone (range 0.5-4 mg). No other antipsychotic medication or ongoing
      benzodiazepine therapy was allowed. There was a significant decrease in mean
      Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores from baseline (27.5+/-7.5) to week 1
      (-10.8, P<0.0001), week 3 (-17.7, P<0.0001) and to week 12(-22.6, P<0.0001). When
      response was defined as > or = 50% reduction in YMRS scores from baseline, 32%,
      68% and 90% of patients met criteria at week 1, week 3 and week 12, respectively.
      Significant decreases in mean 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores
      from baseline (12.2+/-7.7) to week 3 (-5.7, P<0.0001) and week 12 (-5.7,
      P<0.0001) were also observed. No significant changes in extrapyramidal symptoms
      were noted between baseline and endpoint. The mean daily dose of risperidone was 
      2 mg with a median of 1.8 mg. These findings support the results of the two
      previous double-blind, randomized trials and indicate that the addition of
      risperidone to mood stabilizers is a safe and effective treatment for acute and
      continuation treatment of mania. Risperidone add-on does not induce depressive
      symptoms and, furthermore, risperidone may have efficacy in treating comorbid
      depressive symptoms in bipolar patients.

TI  - Calming versus sedative effects of intramuscular olanzapine in agitated patients.
PG  - 192-8
AB  - Distinct calming rather than nonspecific sedation is desirable for the treatment 
      of acute agitation. In 3 double-blind studies, acutely agitated patients with
      schizophrenia (N = 311), bipolar mania (N = 201), or dementia (N = 206) were
      treated with intramuscular (1-3 injections/24 hrs) olanzapine (2.5-10.0 mg),
      haloperidol (7.5 mg), lorazepam (2.0 mg), or placebo. The Agitation-Calmness
      Evaluation Scale (ACES; Eli Lilly and Co.) and treatment-emergent adverse events 
      assessed sedation. Across all studies, 1 patient (lorazepam-treated, bipolar)
      became unarousable. There were no significant between-group differences in ACES
      scores of deep sleep or unarousable at any time across. Excluding asleep
      patients, agitation remained significantly more reduced with olanzapine than
      placebo (P <.05). The incidences of adverse events indicative of sedation were
      not significantly different with olanzapine versus comparators. For the treatment
      of acute agitation associated with schizophrenia, bipolar mania, or dementia,
      intramuscular olanzapine-treated patients experienced no more sedation than
      haloperidol- or lorazepam-treated patients and experienced distinct calming
      rather than nonspecific sedation.

TI  - The use of atypical antipsychotics in traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 177-95
AB  - The use of antipsychotic medication in treating individuals with traumatic brain 
      injury (TBI) has been controversial. Much of the caution derives from animal
      studies (and limited human data) with regard to typical antipsychotics. Of note, 
      however, is that similar assumptions have been made about the newer generation of
      atypical antipsychotics as well. Because these agents have different mechanisms
      of action as well as different neurotransmitter targets, this may very well be
      unwarranted. In this article, mechanisms of action of typical and atypical
      antipsychotics are discussed, with particular attention paid to their use in TBI.
      Indications and contraindications are presented, and recommendations are made for
      the responsible prescribing of antipsychotic medications after TBI.

TI  - Classification and treatment of tardive syndromes.
PG  - 16-27
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tardive syndromes are a group of delayed-onset abnormal involuntary
      movement disorders induced by a dopamine receptor blocking agent. There are
      several phenomenologically distinct types of TS. REVIEW SUMMARY: The term tardive
      dyskinesia has been used to refer to the TS that presents with rapid, repetitive,
      stereotypic movements mostly involving the oral, buccal, and lingual areas.
      Tardive dystonia can be focal, segmental, or generalized. It commonly affects the
      face and neck followed by the arms and trunk. It usually results in retrocollis
      when it involves the neck and trunk arching backwards when it involves the trunk.
      Tardive akathisia is characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and
      jitteriness with an inability to sit or stand still. Other tardive syndromes
      include tardive tics, myoclonus, tremor, and withdrawal-emergent syndrome. It
      remains unclear whether tardive parkinsonism truly exists. The only way to
      prevent TS is to avoid its etiologic agents. Chronic use of dopamine receptor
      blocking agents should be limited as much as possible to patients with chronic
      psychoses. In general, for mild TS, reducing the neuroleptic dose, switching to
      an atypical agent, or discontinuing antipsychotic treatment altogether in the
      hope of facilitating remission is recommended. For moderate to severe TS,
      tetrabenazine or reserpine may be the most effective agent. Neuroleptics should
      be resumed to treat TD in the absence of active psychosis only as a last resort
      for persistent, disabling, and treatment-resistant TD. CONCLUSIONS: The severity 
      of the TS and the absolute need for antipsychotic therapy often dictate the
      treatment approach for this disorder.

TI  - Comparison of cognitive performances during a placebo period and an atypical
      antipsychotic treatment period in schizophrenia: critical examination of
      confounds.
PG  - 1491-500
AB  - Although previous studies report cognitive improvement following atypical
      antipsychotic administration in schizophrenia (SC), few placebo-controlled
      within-subject studies with examination of confounds (symptom reduction,
      cooperation, learning, and outliers) have been reported. The present study
      examines the effects of atypicals and confounds upon cognition in SC. The
      hypothesis tested was that relative to placebo, atypicals as a general class of
      medication would elicit cognitive improvement in SC. In all, 19 patients with SC 
      (15 males) completed the double-blind, counterbalanced, randomized within-subject
      study of the effects of atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, clozapine,
      olanzapine, or quetiapine) vs placebo administration upon cognitive performance
      in the domains of executive function, attention, memory, language, visual
      perception, and general intellect. Significant cognitive improvement during
      atypical antipsychotic administration relative to placebo withdrawal occurred in 
      most cognitive domains with robust improvements in intelligence (p=0.001), memory
      (p=0.0009), and fluency (p <0.002) even after outliers and unmotivated
      performances were excluded. These findings suggest that relative to placebo
      withdrawal, atypicals improve cognitive performance in SC. However, this finding 
      may not be specific to atypicals, since analogous studies of typicals have not
      been performed.

TI  - Estimating the costs and benefits of new drug therapies: atypical antipsychotic
      drugs for schizophrenia.
PG  - 619-35
AB  - This article presents an analytic tool populated with data from published studies
      to illustrate the likely impacts of a switch from typical to atypical
      antipsychotic drugs over a 3-year period on individual, family, and societal
      outcomes for a U.S. schizophrenia population. Data taken from clinical trials and
      observational data studies are used. Changes in annual health care costs,
      schizophrenia symptom days, extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) days, suicide rates, and
      employment days are estimated. For each 1,000 people treated with typical drugs, 
      the base case scenario gives estimates of annual medical care costs of dollar
      28.9 million with 80,253 moderate/severe schizophrenia symptom days and 92,006
      EPS days. In the base case scenario, after switching to atypical drugs,
      schizophrenia symptom days are estimated to decrease up to 33 percent, EPS days
      up to 50 percent, and total medical care costs up to 19 percent over the 3-year
      period. Suicide rates fall and employment rates increase. The direction of the
      impacts remain the same for a wide range of input parameter values used in
      sensitivity analyses. Thus, switching to atypical drugs will likely reduce total 
      medical care costs and decrease other disease burdens for people with
      schizophrenia, their families, and society.

TI  - Rationale, design, and methods of the systematic treatment enhancement program
      for bipolar disorder (STEP-BD).
PG  - 1028-42
AB  - The Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) was
      conceived in response to a National Institute of Mental Health initiative seeking
      a public health intervention model that could generate externally valid answers
      to treatment effectiveness questions related to bipolar disorder. STEP-BD, like
      all effectiveness research, faces many design challenges, including how to do the
      following: recruit a representative sample of patients for studies of readily
      available treatments; implement a common intervention strategy across diverse
      settings; determine outcomes for patients in multiple phases of illness; make
      provisions for testing as yet undetermined new treatments; integrate adjunctive
      psychosocial interventions; and avoid biases due to subject drop-out and
      last-observation-carried-forward data analyses. To meet these challenges, STEP-BD
      uses a hybrid design to collect longitudinal data as patients make transitions
      between naturalistic studies and randomized clinical trials. Bipolar patients of 
      every subtype with age >/= 15 years are accessioned into a study registry. All
      patients receive a systematic assessment battery at entry and are treated by a
      psychiatrist (trained to deliver care and measure outcomes in patients with
      bipolar disorder) using a series of model practice procedures consistent with
      expert recommendations. At every follow-up visit, the treating psychiatrist
      completes a standardized assessment and assigns an operationalized clinical
      status based on DSM-IV criteria. Patients have independent evaluations at regular
      intervals throughout the study and remain under the care of the same treating
      psychiatrist while making transitions between randomized care studies and the
      standard care treatment pathways. This article reviews the methodology used for
      the selection and certification of the clinical treatment centers, training study
      personnel, the general approach to clinical management, and the sequential
      treatment strategies offered in the STEP-BD standard and randomized care pathways
      for bipolar depression and relapse prevention.

TI  - Combination pharmacotherapy in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.
PG  - 978-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to develop prospective data on the
      effectiveness of combination pharmacotherapy of children and adolescents with
      bipolar disorder during a 6-month period of prospective, semi-naturalistic
      treatment. METHODS: Thirty-five subjects, with a mean age of 11 years, were
      treated in the extension phase of this study after having received 6-8 weeks of
      acute treatment with a single mood stabilizer. The extension phase of this study 
      lasted for another 16 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks of prospective treatment.
      During this study phase, subjects were openly treated, and they could have their 
      acute-phase mood stabilizer switched or augmented with another mood stabilizer, a
      stimulant, an antidepressant agent, or antipsychotic agent, if they were assessed
      to be a nonresponder to monotherapy with their initial mood stabilizer. RESULTS: 
      During the extension phase of treatment, 20 of 35 subjects (58%) required
      treatment with one or two mood stabilizers and either a stimulant, an atypical
      antipsychotic agent, or an antidepressant agent. The response rate to combination
      therapy was very good, with 80% of subjects treated responding to combination
      therapy with two mood stabilizers after not responding to monotherapy with a mood
      stabilizer. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that children and adolescents with
      bipolar disorder are similar to adults with bipolar disorder, who also frequently
      require combination therapy.

TI  - Effect size of symptom status in withdrawal of typical antipsychotics and
      subsequent clozapine treatment in patients with treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 1133-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In light of the efficacy of newer antipsychotic agents and the
      possibility that drug withdrawal may negatively affect subsequent drug response, 
      concern has arisen that the use of placebo in schizophrenia research may be
      unethical. This study examines the effect size of symptom exacerbation during
      drug washout with placebo and the effects of drug washout on the efficacy of
      subsequent drug treatment. METHOD: Fifty patients with treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia hospitalized on a research unit participated in a double-blind
      longitudinal study of the effects of drug washout after chronic treatment with a 
      typical antipsychotic and before prospective treatment with clozapine. Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores were analyzed to examine drug effects and 
      effect sizes for baseline treatment with a typical antipsychotic (>6 months
      treatment), drug washout with placebo (mean=34 days), early treatment with
      clozapine (mean=42 days, mean dose=345.0 mg/day), and optimal clozapine treatment
      (mean=83 days, mean dose=450.5 mg/day). RESULTS: Patients' BPRS total, positive, 
      and negative symptom scores significantly increased during placebo washout,
      compared with baseline treatment, and significantly decreased with administration
      of clozapine, compared with placebo washout and baseline treatment. However, 30% 
      of patients showed some symptom improvement during placebo washout. The effect
      sizes for the BPRS total score were 0.63 for baseline treatment versus placebo
      washout, 1.10 for optimal clozapine treatment versus placebo washout, and 0.82
      for optimal clozapine treatment versus baseline treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom
      exacerbation induced by drug withdrawal in patients with treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia did not impede subsequent responsiveness to clozapine. The effect
      size for clozapine, compared with typical antipsychotics, suggests that the
      drug-washout longitudinal design is useful for establishing a drug-free baseline 
      and for investigating drug response, while requiring relatively few subjects.

TI  - Long-acting injectable risperidone: efficacy and safety of the first long-acting 
      atypical antipsychotic.
PG  - 1125-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors assessed the efficacy and safety of the first long-acting 
      atypical antipsychotic (long-acting injectable risperidone) in patients with
      schizophrenia. METHOD: In a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study,
      patients received intramuscular injections every 2 weeks of placebo or
      long-acting risperidone (25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg). The primary measure of efficacy
      was the change in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.
      RESULTS: Of the 554 patients who were enrolled, 400 entered the double-blind
      study, and 370 received at least one postbaseline assessment. Mean changes in
      score of -6.2, -8.5, and -7.4 on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were
      seen at endpoint for the 25-, 50-, and 75-mg risperidone groups, respectively;
      all three change scores were significantly different from that seen with placebo 
      (+2.6). Improvements in positive and negative symptoms were also significantly
      greater in patients receiving risperidone. Long-acting risperidone was well
      tolerated. Adverse events related to extrapyramidal symptoms were spontaneously
      reported by 13% of patients receiving placebo and 10% of patients in the 25-mg
      risperidone group, with higher rates in the 50-mg and 75-mg groups. Severity of
      extrapyramidal symptoms was mild at baseline and throughout the trial in each
      treatment group. Mean weight changes were small in the 25-, 50-, and 75-mg
      risperidone groups (0.5 kg, 1.2 kg, and 1.9 kg, respectively). Injection site
      pain was rated as low by the patients, consistent with the investigators' pain
      ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Long-acting injectable risperidone was efficacious and well
      tolerated and provides both clinicians and patients with a new mode of treatment 
      that can improve the outcome of long-term therapy.

TI  - Efficacy of nefazodone in the treatment of neuroleptic induced extrapyramidal
      side effects: a double-blind randomised parallel group placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 271-5
AB  - Many atypical antipsychotics show antagonism at both serotonergic and
      dopaminergic neurones and show fewer extrapyramidal side effects (EPS).
      Nefazodone blocks postsynaptic 5HT2A receptors and weakly inhibits serotonin
      reuptake. This study aimed to elucidate the role of nefazodone in the treatment
      of antipsychotic-induced EPS. The trial was a double-blind, randomised,
      placebo-controlled trial of patients requiring antipsychotic treatment with
      haloperidol 10mg daily; from which a subgroup of patients who developed EPS were 
      selected for the study. Patients were randomised to add-on therapy with either
      placebo (n=24) or nefazodone (n=25) 100mg bd. EPS were measured on days 0, 3 and 
      7 using the Simpson Angus, Barnes akathisia, abnormal involuntary movement and
      Chouinard scales. Nefazodone significantly reduced EPS as measured by both the
      Simpson Angus scale and CGI (p=0.007 and 0.0247, respectively). Akathisia and
      tardive dyskinesia did not differ between the two groups (p=0.601; p=0.507,
      respectively). These results suggest the role of 5HT2 antagonism in the mechanism
      of action of atypical antipsychotics with respect to lowering rates of
      drug-induced EPS. In addition, a therapeutic role for nefazodone is suggested in 
      the treatment of antipsychotic-induced EPS.

TI  - The early stage of vascular dementia: significance of a complete therapeutic
      program.
PG  - 402-6
AB  - THEORY: Mild manifestations of vascular dementia are relatively widespread among 
      the old-age population. Drug therapy for this disorder is insufficiently
      effective at present, making it necessary to improve the treatment of such
      patients by means of an adequate psychotherapeutic and rehabilitation program.
      AIMS: To assess the role of psychotherapeutic and rehabilitation measures in
      improving outcome in the early stage of vascular dementia. METHODS: The test and 
      control cohorts (each n = 95) were matched for characteristics found to be
      significant for outcome of treatment (the relevant predictors were found using
      Multiple Regression Analysis). The cohorts differed in the amount of the
      psychotherapy and rehabilitation received. To assess the effects of treatment the
      SCAG scale and a special scale for evaluating the level of activity in the
      household were used. RESULTS: In the test cohort the patients' condition improved
      significantly compared with the controls. Even in case of only slight therapeutic
      reduction of psychopathologic symptoms the systematic use of psychotherapeutic
      and rehabilitation methods favoured preserving a certain level of activity in the
      household and for some patients even improving it. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
      therapy at the early stage of vascular dementia to a great extent depend on
      carrying out a full-scale psychotherapeutic and rehabilitation program. The
      positive significance of the latter is connected not only with improvement of
      clinical indices but also with direct optimizing the every day life activity
      level.

TI  - Undiagnosed hyperglycemia in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 605-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine has been demonstrated to be superior to typical
      neuroleptics in reducing refractory symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, but 
      it has also been associated with hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. This study 
      was designed to investigate the proportion of undiagnosed impaired fasting
      glucose and diabetes mellitus in patients prescribed clozapine at 8 Department of
      Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. METHOD: All patients diagnosed by the VA
      in New England with ICD-9 schizophrenia from Oct. 1, 1999, to Sept. 30, 2000, who
      received a prescription for clozapine were identified, and an attempt was made to
      obtain a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test. All patients were also characterized 
      as to whether they were diagnosed as diabetic prior to the screening FPG.
      Patients not previously diagnosed as diabetic were divided into 2 groups: normal 
      FPG (< 110 mg/dL) and elevated FPG (>or= 110 mg/dL). Clinical and
      sociodemographic characteristics of the 2 groups were compared using chi-square
      and t tests. RESULTS: Overall, 121 patients were not previously diagnosed as
      diabetic and received an FPG. Ninety-three (77%) had a normal FPG, and 28 (23%)
      had an elevated plasma glucose-including 17% with impaired fasting glucose and 6%
      with diabetes. Patients with hyperglycemia were significantly older (p =.007) and
      more commonly codiagnosed with bipolar disorder (p =.04). CONCLUSION:
      Hyperglycemia was common in patients receiving clozapine who had not been
      previously diagnosed as diabetic. These patients should be considered a group at 
      high risk to develop diabetes mellitus and deserve both close monitoring and
      early intervention at the first sign of the onset of either diabetes or impaired 
      glucose tolerance.

TI  - Serum leptin and triglyceride levels in patients on treatment with atypical
      antipsychotics.
PG  - 598-604
AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight gain is a common adverse effect associated with the use of
      most antipsychotic drugs. Leptin has been reported to be associated with
      antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Previous studies have demonstrated a
      relationship between the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine and
      serum leptin levels. We planned to comparatively investigate the effects of the
      atypical antipsychotics quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine on
      leptin and triglyceride levels and weight gain. METHOD: The study population
      comprised 56 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia, who were divided into 4
      treatment groups: quetiapine (N = 14), olanzapine (N = 14), risperidone (N = 14),
      or clozapine (N = 14) monotherapy, and a control group of 11 patients receiving
      no psychopharmacologic treatment. The patients were evaluated at baseline and at 
      the sixth week according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS),
      body mass index (BMI), weight, and fasting serum leptin and triglyceride levels. 
      Data were gathered in 2001 and 2002. RESULTS: Olanzapine and clozapine caused a
      marked increase in weight and serum triglyceride and leptin levels, though
      increases in these variables were modest in the patients receiving quetiapine and
      minimal in those receiving risperidone. There were positive correlations between 
      serum leptin levels and BMI and triglyceride levels. Clinical efficacy, as
      indicated by decrease in total PANSS scores, was associated with leptin levels in
      all atypical antipsychotic groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that leptin
      may be associated with olanzapine- and clozapine-induced weight gain and that
      quetiapine appears to have modest influence and risperidone appears to have
      minimal influence on leptin and triglyceride levels and weight gain compared with
      olanzapine and clozapine.

TI  - Risperidone compared with olanzapine in a naturalistic clinical study: a cost
      analysis.
PG  - 589-97
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risperidone and olanzapine are thought to have broadly similar
      clinical effects. This study was designed as a cost analysis study comparing
      costs and basic clinical outcomes of treatment with risperidone or olanzapine in 
      a naturalistic setting. METHOD: The U.K. Risperidone Olanzapine Drug Outcomes
      Studies in Schizophrenia (RODOS-UK) program consisted of a retrospective review
      of medical notes and prescription charts for 501 patients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder who had been admitted to the hospital for the treatment 
      of psychosis. The main outcome measure was cost of inpatient drug treatment.
      Clinical outcomes (clinician-assessed and -documented effectiveness, time to
      discharge) were also evaluated. Data were collected and verified between June and
      September 2000. RESULTS: Clinical outcomes were similar for risperidone and
      olanzapine. Clinician-assessed effectiveness was similar for both treatments (78%
      risperidone, 74% olanzapine; p =.39), but mean time to documented onset of
      effectiveness was significantly shorter for those treated with risperidone versus
      olanzapine (17.6 vs. 22.4 days; p =.01). Risperidone-treated patients stayed a
      mean of 9 fewer days in the hospital compared with olanzapine-treated patients
      (49 vs. 58 days; p =.007). The possibility that these observed differences were a
      result of different baseline characteristics could not be entirely discounted.
      Mean +/- SD doses of risperidone and olanzapine were 5.5 +/- 2.4 mg/day and 14.1 
      +/- 4.7 mg/day, respectively. The mean daily cost of all inpatient drugs was
      significantly higher for olanzapine than for risperidone (pound 5.63 vs. pound
      3.92; p <.0001). Mean total costs of all inpatient drugs were significantly
      higher for olanzapine than for risperidone (pound 164 vs. pound 96; p <.0001),
      which partly reflected the longer mean treatment duration for olanzapine compared
      with risperidone (44 vs. 37 days). Concomitant antipsychotic use was similar for 
      both groups (66% risperidone, 67% olanzapine). The number of patients documented 
      as experiencing adverse events was not different between groups (22% risperidone,
      19% olanzapine; p =.32). CONCLUSION: Risperidone and olanzapine produced broadly 
      comparable clinical outcome in this cohort of hospitalized patients, but the use 
      of risperidone was associated with significantly lower drug treatment costs.

TI  - Effectiveness of switching to ziprasidone for stable but symptomatic outpatients 
      with schizophrenia.
PG  - 580-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many outpatients with schizophrenia experience persistent symptoms or
      side effects on their current antipsychotic regimen. Few studies have
      prospectively examined the effects of the prior medication or switching method on
      the safety and efficacy of a newly available antipsychotic. Efficacy and
      tolerability of ziprasidone were evaluated in patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia 
      or schizoaffective disorder who were switched from conventional or atypical
      antipsychotics in three 6-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label,
      parallel-group trials. METHOD: Stable outpatients with persistent symptoms or
      troublesome side effects on (1) conventional antipsychotic (N = 108), (2)
      olanzapine (N = 104), or (3) risperidone (N = 58) therapy were switched to an
      open-label, 6-week, flexible-dose trial of ziprasidone (40-160 mg/day). Patients 
      were randomly assigned at baseline to 1 of 3 switching schedules during the first
      week of ziprasidone therapy. Baseline and outcome assessments included Positive
      and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impressions of Severity
      (CGI-S) ratings. RESULTS: All 3 switching strategies were well tolerated for all 
      3 patient groups. After 6 weeks on ziprasidone therapy, significant (p <.05)
      improvements were observed on all major symptom measures and almost all subscales
      for all switched subgroups. CONCLUSION: Switching stable but symptomatic
      outpatients from their previous antipsychotic to ziprasidone was generally well
      tolerated and was associated with symptom improvements 6 weeks later.
      Improvements occurred in patients recently on other first-line atypical
      antipsychotic, as well as in those on conventional antipsychotic, treatment.
      While limitations of switching study designs do not permit interpretation of
      comparative efficacy, these studies suggest that outpatients who partially
      respond to conventional antipsychotics, risperidone, or olanzapine may experience
      improved control of psychotic symptoms following a switch to ziprasidone.

TI  - A post hoc analysis of the impact on hostility and agitation of quetiapine and
      haloperidol among patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 530-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quetiapine, a drug with a broad pharmacologic profile (similar to
      that of clozapine), may show benefits for agitation in patients with psychoses.
      Also, quetiapine may be superior to placebo and either equal or superior to
      haloperidol in treating this symptom. Available data for other second-generation 
      antipsychotic agents show that quetiapine may have better efficacy in improving
      agitation compared with haloperidol. OBJECTIVE: This reanalysis of a previously
      reported pivotal clinical trial assessed whether quetiapine or haloperidol has
      benefits for the treatment of hostility and agitation among patients experiencing
      an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. METHODS: Patients aged 18 to 65 years of 
      either sex and any ethnicity who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia based on the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition
      criteria and who were experiencing an acute exacerbation were recruited into the 
      study. A priori, data from patients assigned to 4 therapeutically effective
      quetiapine treatment groups (150, 300, 600, and 750 mg) in a previously reported 
      6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial were combined and
      compared with data from patients given haloperidol 12 mg or placebo on an
      agitation measure derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).
      Patients who received at least 2 weeks of treatment who had a baseline assessment
      and at least 1 postbaseline assessment after the 2 weeks of treatment were
      included. An analysis of variance with the baseline hostility score and center as
      covariates was used to assess treatment effects of quetiapine or haloperidol
      versus placebo for changes in agitation scores. A path analysis was used to
      separate the direct from the indirect effects (via improvements in psychoses
      and/or overall psychopathology) on agitation scores of quetiapine relative to
      haloperidol. RESULTS: A total of 257 patients (193 men, 64 women) were studied.
      The combined quetiapine groups comprised 175 patients; the haloperidol group, 42 
      patients; and the placebo group, 40 patients. Quetiapine treatment reduced
      agitation scores significantly among patients with acute psychoses compared with 
      placebo. A slight reduction in agitation scores was found when haloperidol
      treatment was compared with placebo, but this difference was not statistically
      significant. Compared with haloperidol, quetiapine treatment had a direct and
      significant effect on agitation that was independent of the improvement in
      psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The data in this study suggest that quetiapine
      treatment has benefits for hostility and agitation among patients experiencing an
      acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Furthermore, the path analysis indicated
      that, relative to haloperidol, quetiapine appeared to have direct effects on
      agitation that were independent of improvements in psychoses or overall
      psychopathology, as assessed by the BPRS.

TI  - Placebo or active control trials of antipsychotic drugs?
PG  - 458-64
AB  - The placebo-controlled trial has been the standard method to demonstrate efficacy
      and safety of antipsychotic drugs. We reviewed the scientific and ethical
      advantages and disadvantages of the placebo-controlled trial and an alternative
      method, the active-control trial, focusing more specifically on the
      active-control noninferiority trial. Recent meta-analyses indicate that a
      therapeutic dose of second-generation antipsychotic will very likely be
      statistically superior to placebo in an adequate trial, and that the average
      improvement of schizophrenia symptoms in a placebo arm will be small. These
      findings strengthen the scientific and ethical justification for the
      active-control noninferiority trial. New drugs in the pharmacotherapy for
      schizophrenia are often claimed to differ from their marketed competitors in
      their safety profile rather than in antipsychotic efficacy. Thus, in many cases, 
      it appears sufficient to demonstrate mere noninferiority (rather than
      superiority) of antipsychotic efficacy in comparison with a standard
      antipsychotic. The active-control noninferiority trial is suitable for such
      demonstration. Sample size requirements for various equivalence margins in
      noninferiority trials are provided. Scientific and ethical arguments should lead 
      to a more frequent use of the active-control noninferiority trial design.

TI  - Atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar disorder.
PG  - 751-60
AB  - Atypical antipsychotic medications are widely used for the treatment of bipolar
      disorder. Most empirical support suggests that these medications are efficacious 
      in the treatment of acute mania, but there is considerably less support for the
      utility of these drugs in other phases of bipolar disorder. However, it is likely
      that several of these drugs will demonstrate efficacy in relapse prevention, and 
      perhaps antidepressant efficacy in bipolar disorder as more studies are
      conducted. Atypical antipsychotics offer different side effect profiles than
      older antipsychotics, which may be of benefit for some patients. Consequently,
      atypical antipsychotics provide an important treatment option for bipolar
      patients.

TI  - Cognitive rehabilitation with patients having persistent, severe psychiatric

PG  - 325-31
AB  - The effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation in ameliorating the symptomatic,
      cognitive, and functional deficits associated with schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorders was assessed in this prospective study. Thirty-eight
      participants who met DSM-IV criteria were assigned to cognitive rehabilitation
      treatment or treatment as usual (TAU) groups, using the method of minimization to
      equalize groups on prognostic variables believed to affect outcome (i.e.,
      duration and severity of illness, Clozapine). Participants were assessed at
      baseline, treatment end, and 3-month follow-up. Improvement across time was found
      for both groups in delayed visuospatial memory and visual information processing 
      speed, and the participant's status on the prognostic variables was found to be
      related to level of performance on measures of delayed visuospatial memory,
      negative symptoms, and speech disturbance. However, the findings did not provide 
      evidence that cognitive rehabilitation is associated with greater improvement
      than TAU. Nor did the findings indicate that prognosis interacted with treatment 
      to produce differential treatment outcomes.

TI  - Effect of a mental health "carve-out" program on the continuity of antipsychotic 
      therapy.
PG  - 1885-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: On July 1, 1996, as a cost-containment strategy, Tennessee's expanded
      Medicaid program, TennCare, rapidly shifted the provision of mental health
      services to a fully capitated, specialty "carve-out" program, TennCare Partners. 
      We studied the effect of this transition on the continuity of antipsychotic
      therapy among patients with severe mental illness who had previously adhered to
      treatment. METHODS: Study patients were 21 to 64 years of age, were enrolled
      throughout the study period, and had adhered to antipsychotic therapy during a
      6-month base-line period that preceded the 12 months of study follow-up. The
      study population included 4507 patients whose follow-up began on the day the
      change was implemented (the post-transition cohort) and 3644 patients whose
      follow-up began one year earlier (the pretransition cohort). We compared the two 
      cohorts in terms of the loss of continuity of antipsychotic therapy (missed
      treatment for more than 60 days during follow-up) and the mean number of days of 
      antipsychotic therapy during follow-up. RESULTS: As compared with the
      pretransition cohort, the post-transition cohort had increased odds of loss of
      continuity (a multivariate odds ratio of 1.18 [95 percent confidence interval,
      1.07 to 1.30], P=0.001) and a shorter mean duration of antipsychotic therapy (a
      mean reduction of 4.2 days [95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 6.7], P=0.001)
      during follow-up. This difference was most pronounced among high-risk patients
      (those requiring the administration of extended-release [depot] injections of
      antipsychotic medications or who had been hospitalized for psychosis) at base
      line, for whom continuity was most important (odds ratio for loss of continuity, 
      1.79 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.45 to 2.22]; P<0.001; mean reduction in
      the number of days of antipsychotic therapy, 14.4 days [95 percent confidence
      interval, 9.4 to 19.4]; P<0.001). These patients had decreased use of
      antipsychotic drugs immediately after the transition; the lower level persisted
      throughout the 12 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the
      need to ensure that shifts to widely used carve-out programs, which are designed 
      primarily to contain costs, do not adversely affect clinical outcomes.

TI  - Antipsychotic efficacy of the antidepressant trimipramine: a randomized,
      double-blind comparison with the phenothiazine perazine.
PG  - 61-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The tricyclic antidepressant trimipramine exhibits several features
      (e. g., dopaminergic effect, molecular structure similar to a neuroleptic,
      receptor-binding profile similar to clozapine) that suggest its potential as an
      antipsychotic medication. The aim of the study was to investigate the
      antipsychotic potential of trimipramine in a controlled clinical trial comparing 
      its antipsychotic efficacy with that of a neuroleptic. METHOD: In a German
      multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial, the antipsychotic efficacy of
      trimipramine was compared with that of the phenothiazine neuroleptic perazine,
      using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Antidepressant
      efficacy of both agents was measured by use of the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia
      Scale (BRMES). Ninety-five patients with acute schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) and a
      BPRS total score > 40 at baseline were treated with either 300-400 mg
      trimipramine or 450-600 mg perazine for 5 weeks. RESULTS: Therapeutic equivalence
      of both treatments (in the dosages used) could not be demonstrated (change in
      BPRS total score, per-protocol [PP] analysis, one-sided equivalence testing).
      However, intention-to-treat (ITT) as well as PP analysis showed a statistically
      significant decrease in the BPRS total scores in both treatment groups (PP:
      trimipramine, 56.5 +/- 9.8 to 44.1 +/- 17.9; perazine, 56.4 +/- 10.8 to 37.9 +/- 
      12.9). Significant decreases in all BPRS and PANSS subscores as well as CGI
      results and response rate support the antipsychotic efficacy of trimipramine. The
      BRMES total scores significantly decreased in both treatment groups without
      showing a significant difference between the two agents. Trimipramine was better 
      tolerated than perazine and did not elicit extrapyramidal symptoms. CONCLUSION:
      Trimipramine failed to exhibit therapeutic equivalence to perazine in the dosages
      used. However, there was evidence of a substantial antipsychotic effect of
      trimipramine. It may be a useful medication if depressive symptoms in psychotic
      patients require antidepressant treatment or if other antipsychotics cannot be
      administered.

TI  - Long-term treatment of schizoaffective disorder: review and recommendations.
PG  - 45-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of long-term treatment studies in
      schizoaffective disorder (SAD) and to draw conclusions for clinical
      decision-making. METHOD: Literature was identified by searches in Medline,
      Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register as well as a hand-search of
      handbook and journal articles. Studies were considered relevant if they reported 
      on trials of at least 6 months duration and if they presented data for the SAD
      patients in particular. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met the criteria and 18 used
      modern diagnostic criteria, i. e., RDC, DSM-III-R, -IV, or ICD-10. The studies
      focused on lithium, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics. The scientific evidence 
      for prophylactic efficacy of the different substances is poor. Nevertheless, the 
      data encourage the use of lithium and carbamazepine in primarily affective
      patients and clozapine in primarily schizophrenic patients and possibly in mainly
      affective patients as well. CONCLUSIONS: There is a considerable need for
      prospective and controlled studies on the long-term treatment of SAD. However, it
      seems to be useful to subtype the disorder of the patients into primarily
      affective vs. schizophrenic schizoaffective disorder and schizodepressive vs.
      schizobipolar and to treat accordingly.

TI  - Are patients enrolled in first episode psychosis drug trials representative of
      patients treated in routine clinical practice?
PG  - 149-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence on efficacy of antipsychotic medications comes primarily
      from controlled trials which select eligible consenting patients for experimental
      and regimented treatments, who do not abuse drugs, and are in good general
      health. Thus, it is not clear to what extent results are generalizable to most
      individuals treated for a psychotic illness who may not be eligible for such
      trials. OBJECTIVE: This study compared characteristics of patients treated in a
      large randomized trial of persons with early psychosis to a cohort from a large
      epidemiological study of first episode psychosis. METHODS: Included were the 535 
      patients enrolled in a controlled trial of antipsychotic medication and 179
      similarly diagnosed persons from the Suffolk County Mental Health epidemiological
      study. Drug trial exclusion criteria were used to estimate the number of patients
      from the epidemiological study who would have been ineligible for the drug trial.
      The two samples were compared on key characteristics. RESULTS: Thirty-three
      percent (n=59) of the epidemiological sample did not meet inclusion criteria for 
      the drug trial (due to antidepressant treatment, n=26; current substance abuse,
      n=18; recent suicide attempt, n=9; and for more than one reason, n=6). There were
      no significant differences between the two study samples on age of onset, age,
      gender and premorbid functioning. Drug trial patients had higher Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), slightly lower Clinical Global Impression (CGI),
      and less formal education than those in the epidemiological study. CONCLUSIONS:
      While some patients in the epidemiological sample would have been excluded from
      the drug trial, patients in the two studies were similar on several key
      variables.

TI  - Aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia: safety and tolerability in
      short-term, placebo-controlled trials.
PG  - 123-36
AB  - Aripiprazole is a novel antipsychotic with a unique mechanism of action.
      Presented here is a pooled analysis of safety and tolerability data from all
      completed short-term, placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia from the
      aripiprazole clinical development program. Data were analyzed from five 4- to
      6-week double-blind multicenter studies of patients hospitalized with acute
      relapse of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder randomized to aripiprazole
      (n=932), placebo (n=416), or haloperidol (n=201). Daily aripiprazole doses ranged
      from 2 to 30 mg. Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) reports, EPS
      scales, ECGs, weight, and prolactin, glucose and cholesterol levels. Aripiprazole
      was well tolerated, with similar AE incidence rates to placebo, and lower rates
      than haloperidol for akathisia, extrapyramidal syndrome and somnolence. Objective
      EPS assessments demonstrated no significant differences between aripiprazole and 
      placebo on Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) scores, no dose-dependent effects on Barnes 
      Akathisia scores, and significant reductions in Abnormal Involuntary Movement
      Scale (AIMS) scores from baseline vs. placebo (p</=0.01). Haloperidol showed
      increased SAS and Barnes Akathisia scores over placebo (p</=0.01). There was
      minimal mean weight change with aripiprazole (+0.71 kg) and haloperidol (+0.56
      kg), and a lack of QT(c) prolongation. Serum prolactin increased with
      haloperidol, but not aripiprazole. In conclusion, aripiprazole shows a favorable 
      safety and tolerability profile with low potential for EPS, weight gain,
      prolactin elevation, QT(c) prolongation, and sedation. Aripiprazole's safety
      profile may offer benefits in schizophrenia treatment.

TI  - A random-assignment, double-blind, clinical trial of once- vs twice-daily
      administration of quetiapine fumarate in patients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder: a pilot study.
PG  - 187-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of administering quetiapine once
      vs twice daily. METHOD: Utilizing a double-blind design, 21 hospitalized adult
      men or women with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, who had
      received unchanged doses (for 2 weeks) of either 400 or 600 mg daily of
      quetiapine administered in 2 doses, were randomly assigned to once- or
      twice-daily administration for 4 weeks and then crossed over to the opposite
      dosing regimen for an additional 4 weeks. Standard psychopathology and safety
      measures were used in the study. RESULTS: Nearly 70% (15/21) of the subjects met 
      the a priori efficacy responder criteria with no statistical differences in
      response between those assigned to once- or twice-daily quetiapine
      administration. Statistical analyses confirmed that most subjects maintained
      efficacy during the switch to once- or twice-daily administration with
      quetiapine. A minority (15%) did experience worsening of symptoms or orthostatic 
      hypotension during the crossover. Quetiapine was generally well tolerated at
      either twice- or once-daily administration. CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data suggest
      that it is clinically feasible to switch most quetiapine-treated subjects
      receiving a therapeutic twice-daily dosing schedule to a once-daily regimen. A
      minority may experience worsening of symptoms or orthostatic hypotension during
      the switch. This strategy of administering quetiapine entirely at bedtime may
      promote improved adherence to treatment.

TI  - [Subjective and objective assessment of memory functions in patients with
      schizophrenia treated with olanzapine].
PG  - 989-1002
AB  - Schizophrenic patients often complain of intellectual functioning impairment. The
      aim of this survey was to define the subjective memory loss by means of objective
      tests. The tests were carried out in three steps: before the admission to the
      clinic, after 6 weeks of hospitalisation, and after approximately 12 months from 
      the beginning of the olanzapine treatment, 36 patients were examined (9 female,
      27 male) aged 20-53 (X = 25.4). The following tests were applied: PANSS, Memory
      Questionnaire (Squire, Zouzounis 1988), subscales: Digit span and Similarities of
      the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, subtest for Long-term memory of the Choynowski's
      Memory Scale, Diagnosis of Brain Damages (Weidlich, Lamberti), Clock Completion
      Test, Decroly Box. The subjective assessment of memory functioning improved
      during the treatment with olanzapine. Before the hospitalisation and after 6
      weeks of treatment patients' memory complaints were associated with the
      visuospatial memory. After 12 month of the olanzapine therapy the memory
      complaints were associated with audioverbal memory. Age, level of education and
      objective intensity of psychopathological symptoms did not influence patients'
      subjective assessment of memory functioning.

TI  - [Effect of olanzapine treatment on cognitive functions in patients with
      schizophrenia].
PG  - 967-87
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to assess whether olanzapine treatment results in 
      an improvement of cognitive functions that became impaired by the schizophrenic
      process. METHOD: The correlation of the intensity of schizophrenic symptoms and
      duration of the disease with the level of cognitive functions were also examined.
      The schizophrenic patients were examined in three steps: before beginning of
      olanzapine treatment, after 6 weeks of treatment, and after approximately 12
      months since the beginning of the olanzapine treatment, 36 patients were examined
      (9 female, 27 male) aged 20-53 (X = 25.4). The following tests were applied:
      Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale--PANSS, Squire's Memory Questionnaire,
      sub-scales: Digit span and Similarities of the Wechsler's Intelligence Scale,
      Long-term memory sub-test of the Choynowski's Memory Scale, Diagnosis of Brain
      Damages, Clock Completion Test, Decroly's Box. RESULTS: The olanzapine treatment 
      of schizophrenia was characterised by significant antipsychotic efficacy
      including both positive and negative symptoms. The positive symptoms were
      associated with the attention range, the planning process context and the
      immediate memory with the tendency towards loosing remembrance in the process of 
      non-verbal learning. The negative symptoms were associated with concrete
      conceptual thinking. Improvement of cognitive functions was noted for almost all 
      of the examined functions. The effect of olanzapine therapy in schizophrenic
      patients may be regarded as personality integrating.

TI  - [Current concepts of pharmacological treatment in schizophrenia].
PG  - 857-68
AB  - The modern concepts of pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia, with the special
      emphasis put on new antipsychotic drugs were presented. The attention was put on 
      the need for careful evaluation of the patient's state: the diagnosis, treatment 
      which the patient receives and compliance with the treatment. It was stated that 
      modern concepts of treatment of schizophrenia do not solely rely on the use of
      modern drugs, but include the multidirectional therapeutic actions with an active
      participation of the patient and his/her relatives.

TI  - Olanzapine, risperidone and haloperidol in the treatment of adolescent patients
      with schizophrenia.
PG  - 545-60
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the drug response and side effects of
      adolescents with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine, risperidone, and
      haloperidol. METHODS: Forty-three patients were treated with olanzapine (n = 19),
      risperidone (n = 17) and haloperidol (n = 7) for 8 weeks in an open clinical
      trial. Clinical improvement was evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale (PANSS), and side effects with the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) 
      Side Effect Rating Scale. RESULTS: Significant clinical improvement was observed 
      by week 4 for all medications. Olanzapine and haloperidol induced fatigability
      more frequently than risperidone. Haloperidol was associated with a higher
      frequency of depression and more severe extrapyramidal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: To 
      the best of our knowledge this is the first study in adolescents to compare the
      efficacy and side effects of three most commonly prescribed antipsychotic
      medications. Olanzapine, risperidone and haloperidol appear to be equally
      effective for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescent inpatients but have
      different side effect profiles.

TI  - Patients on atypical antipsychotic drugs: another high-risk group for type 2
      diabetes.
PG  - 1597-605
AB  - Patients with schizophrenia are more likely than the general population to
      develop diabetes, which contributes to a high risk of cardiovascular
      complications; individuals with schizophrenia are two to three times more likely 
      to die from cardiovascular disease than the general population. The risk of
      diabetes, and hence cardiovascular disease, is particularly increased by some of 
      the new atypical antipsychotic drugs. Individuals taking an atypical
      antipsychotic drug, particularly younger patients under 40 years of age (odds
      ratio 1.63, 95% CI 1.23-2.16), represent an underrecognized group at high risk of
      type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms responsible for antipsychotic-induced diabetes
      remain unclear. Hypotheses include these drugs' potential to cause weight gain,
      possibly through antagonism at the H(1), 5-HT(2A), or 5-HT(2C) receptors. Other
      mechanisms independent of weight gain lead to elevation of serum leptin and
      insulin resistance. Patients with psychoses have difficulties with diet and
      lifestyle interventions for diabetes and weight management. If hyperglycemia
      develops, withdrawal from antipsychotic medication will often be inappropriate,
      and a change to an atypical antipsychotic drug with lower diabetogenic potential 
      should be considered, especially in younger patients. Management of psychoses
      should routinely include body weight and blood glucose monitoring and steps to
      promote exercise and minimize weight gain. Careful collaboration between the
      psychiatric and diabetology teams is essential to minimize the risk of diabetes
      in patients taking atypical antipsychotic medication and for effective management
      when it develops. This collaboration will also help minimize the already high
      risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals with schizophrenia.

TI  - Divalproex sodium versus olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania in bipolar
      disorder: health-related quality of life and medical cost outcomes.
PG  - 288-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Divalproex sodium is a mood stabilizer used in the United States for 
      the treatment of acute mania associated with bipolar disorder. Recently,
      olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, was approved for the treatment of acute
      mania. This study compares the clinical, health-related quality of life (HRQL),
      and economic outcomes of divalproex and olanzapine in the treatment of acute
      mania associated with bipolar disorder. METHOD: This 12-week, double-blind,
      double-dummy, randomized clinical trial included 120 subjects with DSM-IV bipolar
      disorder type I hospitalized for an acute manic episode recruited from 21 U.S.
      clinical centers. Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with either
      divalproex or olanzapine and were followed in hospital for up to 21 days. If
      after 21 days clinical improvements (based on the Mania Rating Scale [MRS]) were 
      not observed, subjects were discontinued. Subjects showing clinical improvement
      were treated for up to 12 weeks. HRQL was assessed using the Quality of Life
      Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) after hospital discharge
      (baseline) and at 6 and 12 weeks. Medical resource use and costs were collected
      over the 12-week study. RESULTS: A total of 120 subjects (N = 63 divalproex, N = 
      57 olanzapine) were randomized, and 78 (65%) were followed beyond 21 days. No
      statistically significant differences between the treatment groups for
      baseline-to-endpoint MRS or Q-LES-Q scores were observed. Total 12-week
      outpatient medical costs were significantly lower for the divalproex-treated
      group (541 US dollars) compared with the olanzapine-treated group (1080 US
      dollars) (p =.004). There was no significant difference in total medical costs
      between the 2 groups (divalproex = 13,703 US dollars; olanzapine = 15,180 US
      dollars; p =.88). CONCLUSION: Divalproex is associated with lower 12-week
      outpatient costs compared with olanzapine. Divalproex and olanzapine have similar
      short-term effects on clinical or HRQL outcomes in bipolar disorder subjects.

TI  - The efficacy of olanzapine monotherapy for acute hypomania or mania in an
      outpatient setting.
PG  - 143-5
AB  - Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of olanzapine for
      treating acute mania or depression symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder. We
      aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of this medication in more usual care
      outpatient settings. A consecutive series of 15 patients entered an open,
      uncontrolled 8-week trial of olanzapine monotherapy. Inclusion criteria included 
      significant hypomanic or manic symptoms greater than or equal to 15 on the Young 
      Mania Rating Scale and no psychotic symptoms. The majority of patients
      experienced significant decreases in mania ratings and more limited improvement
      on depression ratings. Most patients reported adverse events consistent with
      other studies, but few discontinued due to these complaints. This case series
      highlights the individual variation in response to a proven medication.
      Furthermore, it highlights that those medications effective at one end of the
      mood spectrum may not be equally or simultaneously effective with other symptoms,
      emphasizing the complexity of treating bipolar illness.

TI  - Assessment of treatment response in mania: commentary and new findings.
PG  - 79-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of therapeutic interventions in bipolar disorder is
      complicated by rapid, complex clinical changes, high placebo-response rates, and 
      varying times to specific levels of clinical recovery that may not be adequately 
      reflected in averaged rating-scale scores particularly in acute mania, calling
      for improved methods to evaluate treatment responses. Chengappa et al. (1).
      propose operational criteria for specific outcomes based on rating-scale data
      from two placebo-controlled trials of olanzapine in mania. METHODS: These trials 
      and other recent research were considered in commenting on the design, conduct,
      analysis and interpretation of experimental therapeutic trials in mania and to
      optimize olanzapine versus placebo contrasts by systematically varying end-point 
      criteria for mania (YMRS) and depression (HDRS) ratings. RESULTS: Olanzapine
      versus placebo responses were optimally separated at scores of 10 for final
      paired mania and depression ratings, or 5 for each rating scale considered
      separately. CONCLUSIONS: Use of empirically determined end-points derived from
      standard rating scales used in experimental therapeutics research in mood
      disorders can improve both outcome-assessment and separation of active treatment 
      from placebo responses in acute mania.

TI  - Atypical and conventional antipsychotic drugs in treatment-naive first-episode
      schizophrenia: a 52-week randomized trial of clozapine vs chlorpromazine.
PG  - 995-1003
AB  - The purported advantages of second-generation or "atypical" antipsychotics
      relative to first-generation antipsychotics have not been examined in patients
      with a first episode of schizophrenia. This flexible-dose study examined efficacy
      and safety in a randomized, double-blind, 52-week trial, comparing chlorpromazine
      (CPZ) and clozapine (CLZ) in treatment naive patients experiencing their first
      episode of schizophrenia. In all, 160 inpatients with first-episode schizophrenia
      or schizophreniform disorder were randomized to CPZ or CLZ and followed them for 
      52 weeks or until dropout. The primary efficacy measure was time to first
      remission and proportion of time remaining in remission. The analysis was
      supplemented by comparisons on a profile of clinical symptoms and side effects.
      Of these first-episode patients, 80% achieved remission within 1 year (79% CPZ,
      81% CLZ). The Kaplan-Meier estimated median time to first remission was 8 weeks
      for CLZ vs 12 weeks for CPZ (chi(2)(1)=5.56, p=0.02). Both the rate of first
      achieving remission and the odds for being in remission during the trial were
      almost doubled for the CLZ group in comparison with the CPZ group. At 12 weeks,
      CLZ was superior on many rating scale measures of symptom severity while CPZ was 
      not superior on any. These symptom differences remained significant when
      controlling for EPS differences. By 52 weeks many of the symptom differences
      between groups were no longer significantly different. Generally, CLZ produced
      fewer side effects than CPZ, particularly extrapyramidal side effects. There was 
      no significant difference between treatments in weight change or glucose
      metabolism. For each prior year of untreated psychosis, there was a 15% decrease 
      in the odds of achieving remission (OR=0.85; CI 0.75-0.95). A high proportion of 
      first-episode patients remitted within 1 year. We detected no difference in the
      proportion of first-episode patients receiving CLZ or CPZ that achieved
      remission. However, first-episode patients receiving CLZ remitted significantly
      faster and remained in remission longer than subjects receiving CPZ. While the
      CLZ group showed significantly less symptomatology on some measures and fewer
      side effects at 12 weeks, the two treatment groups seemed to converge by 1 year. 
      Longer duration of untreated psychosis was associated with lower odds of
      achieving remission.

TI  - Aripiprazole: efficacy and tolerability profile of a novel-acting atypical
      antipsychotic.
PG  - 145-51
AB  - Aripiprazole, the latest atypical antipsychotic to come to clinical practice, has
      a proposed mechanism of action different to other agents, most notably in its
      partial agonist action at dopamine (D2) receptors and at serotonin (5HT1A)
      receptors. Placebo-controlled comparative trials of aripiprazole confirm efficacy
      for positive, negative and general psychopathology. Treatment-emergent adverse
      effects appear low. Aripiprazole is associated with low propensity for
      extrapyramidal side effects, an absence hyperprolactinemia and a low propensity
      for weight gain. Aripiprazole's clinical role will be determined by clinical
      experience, additional phase IV studies, and comparative information for this
      agent with respect to the efficacy and tolerability profiles of other atypical
      antipsychotic medications.

TI  - Suicide risk in placebo vs active treatment in placebo-controlled trials for
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 365-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: If there is an increased risk of suicide in the placebo arms of
      placebo-controlled studies in patients with schizophrenia, it would be a strong
      ethical argument against the conduct of placebo-controlled studies in this
      patient population. We tested whether the risk of suicide and attempted suicide
      in the placebo arms of placebo-controlled studies among patients with
      schizophrenia is higher than in the active treatment arms of such studies.
      METHODS: All placebo-controlled double-blind studies that were part of a
      registration dossier for the indication schizophrenia, and that were submitted to
      the regulatory authority of the Netherlands from January 1, 1992, through
      December 31, 2002, were reviewed for suicide and attempted suicide. RESULTS: In
      31 studies, 7152 patients were included: 1888 in placebo groups (398.2
      person-years) and 5264 in active compound groups (981.3 person-years). One
      suicide occurred in the placebo groups (0.05%, or an incidence rate of 251 per
      100,000 years of exposure) and 1 in the active compound groups (0.02%, or an
      incidence rate of 102 per 100,000 years of exposure). This difference was not
      statistically significant. Two attempted suicides occurred in the placebo groups 
      (0.11%, or an incidence rate of 502 per 100,000 years of exposure) and 11 in the 
      active compound groups (0.21%, or an incidence rate of 1121 per 100,000 years of 
      exposure). This difference was also not statistically significant. CONCLUSION:
      Concern about increased risk of suicide or attempted suicide in the placebo group
      should not be an argument against the conduct of placebo-controlled trials in
      schizophrenia, provided that appropriate precautions are taken.

TI  - Quetiapine treatment of psychotic symptoms and aggressive behavior in patients
      with dementia with Lewy bodies: a case series.
PG  - 549-53
AB  - The authors describe here the clinical outcomes of quetiapine treatment in nine
      patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) who manifested psychotic symptoms
      and aggressive behavior. Patients who had a score of 3 or higher on any of the
      three items of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), agitation/aggression,
      hallucinations, and delusions, were given quetiapine 25-75 mg/day. Each patient's
      clinical status was assessed at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment by 
      using the NPI, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Simpson-Angus Scale
      (S-A). Five of nine patients had a positive response with a decline of more than 
      50% in the sum of scores for three items of the NPI. The other three patients
      withdrew from quetiapine treatment due to somnolence or orthostatic hypotension. 
      The remaining patient exhibited no clinically significant change in the NPI
      score. The S-A scale was not affected by quetiapine treatment in any patient.
      These findings suggest that quetiapine may be effective in treating psychotic
      symptoms and disruptive behavior in some patients with DLB. Further
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trials with this drug are needed to 
      confirm this observation.

TI  - The influence of olanzapine on immune cells in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 483-5
AB  - In vitro and preclinical studies show that biochemical and behavioral effects of 
      olanzapine are quite similar to those of clozapine. In recent years, some cases
      of reported agranulocytosis due to olanzapine have been published. However, none 
      of these studies compared the hematological and immune parameters before and
      after treatment. The present study is aimed at investigating the influence of
      olanzapine on the immune cell parameters by comparing these before and in the
      third month of olanzapine treatment in patients of schizophrenia. Twenty patients
      who were diagnosed as schizophrenic depending on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria
      were included in the study. The immune parameters of patients were compared by
      measuring them before the treatment and 3 months after treatment. Immune
      parameters were analyzed by using flow-cytometry equipment labeled Coulter Epics 
      Elite ESP. The positivity of cell-surface antibody was evaluated as percentage.
      The rates of CD8 in the third month of the treatment were considerably increased 
      relative to pretreatment. Furthermore, rates of CD4/CD8 were significantly
      decreased in the third month of the treatment relative to before treatment. These
      findings suggest that immune impairment may occur during olanzapine treatment in 
      patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine versus conventional antipsychotics in the 
      acute treatment of first-episode schizophrenic inpatients.
PG  - 473-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of olanzapine compared to
      typical antipsychotics in the treatment of first-episode schizophrenics in acute 
      psychiatric inpatient wards. METHODS: Data were collected from a prospective,
      comparative, nonrandomized, open, observational study of 904 inpatients with
      schizophrenia. One hundred and fifty-eight patients fulfilled the criteria for
      first-episode schizophrenia, defined as (1) the International Classification of
      Diseases: Mental and Behavioral Disorders, 10th ed. (ICD-10) diagnosis of
      schizophrenia, (2) antipsychotic nai;ve, and (3) a course of illness of less than
      5 years. Eighty-nine (56.3%) of these patients were assigned to the olanzapine
      treatment group (OLZ) and 69 (43.7%) to the control group that received treatment
      with conventional antipsychotics (CON). Safety was evaluated in terms of the
      spontaneous adverse events reported and a specific questionnaire for
      extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Clinical status was measured by means of the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global Impression of Severity
      (CGI-S). Clinical response was defined as the baseline-endpoint decrease in
      BPRS>40% plus an endpoint BPRS<18 or an endpoint CGI</=3. RESULTS: The rate of
      clinical response to treatment in the OLZ was 76.7%, compared to 54.4% in the CON
      (chi(2)=8.48; P=.003). Olanzapine was significantly more effective than
      conventional antipsychotics in lowering the total BPRS score (P=.0003), as well
      as each of the following BPRS subscales: positive symptoms (P=.0019), negative
      symptoms (P<.0001), depression (P=.018), and agitation (P=.007), even after mean 
      scores were adjusted for their baseline value and disease duration. Olanzapine
      also proved to be significantly superior to conventional antipsychotics in
      lowering mean CGI scores (P=.013). The frequency with which new EPS appeared, or 
      previously existing ones worsened, was significantly greater in the CON than in
      the OLZ (55.1% vs. 13.5%; P<.001). Anticholinergics were needed more frequently
      in the CON than in the OLZ (58.0% vs. 6.7%; P<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of
      this observational, naturalistic study show that olanzapine is safe and effective
      in a nonselected sample of acute, first-episode schizophrenic inpatients.

TI  - Efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a
      prospective open trial.
PG  - 373-9
AB  - There is a lack of controlled trials examining the effectiveness of
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) combined with olanzapine or risperidone in
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). The authors conducted a prospective,
      open, controlled trial of ECT in TRS in a long-term psychiatric rehabilitation
      unit in Hong Kong. Thirty patients with TRS from an inpatient psychiatric
      rehabilitation unit participated in this study. All subjects were resistant to a 
      host of antipsychotic medications given singly or in different combinations. In
      addition, they were also resistant to or they refused clozapine treatment.
      Fifteen patients completed a course of ECT consisting of 8-20 sessions. Fifteen
      patients who refused ECT formed the control Subjects were assessed at baseline, 1
      week, 1 month, and 2 months after their last ECT. Assessment instruments included
      the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
      (HDRS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Global Assessment
      Scale (GAS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), CGI Severity of Illness
      [CGI(SOI)], CGI Global Improvement [CGI(GI)], Nurses' Observation Scale for
      Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE-30), and occupational therapists' rating of the
      subjects' functioning with respect to work (OT-W), social (OT-S), and leisure
      (OT-L) activities. In comparison with the control group, the ECT group showed
      statistically significant improvement only in the GAS and CGI at each
      posttreatment evaluation. There was a trend for ECT to reduce positive and
      negative symptoms, although the rate of improvement did not reach statistically
      significant levels. ECT augmentation of risperidone and olanzapine is of marginal
      efficacy compared to reports of the greater augmentation of these antipsychotics 
      with other agents.

TI  - A placebo-controlled trial of risperidone in Tourette syndrome.
PG  - 1130-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone in children and
      adults with Tourette syndrome. METHODS: This was an 8-week, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome measure was the Total
      Tic score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). RESULTS: Thirty-four
      medication-free subjects (26 children and 8 adults) ranging in age from 6 to 62
      years (mean = 19.7 +/- 17.0 years) participated. YGTSS Total Tic scores were
      similar at baseline (26.0 +/- 5.1 for risperidone vs 27.4 +/- 8.5 for placebo).
      After 8 weeks of treatment (mean daily dose of 2.5 +/- 0.85), the 16 subjects on 
      risperidone showed a 32% reduction in tic severity from baseline, compared to a
      7% reduction for placebo patients (n = 18) (F[2,64] = 6.07; p = 0.004). The 12
      children randomized to risperidone showed a 36% reduction in tic symptoms
      compared to an 11% decrease in the 14 children on placebo (F[2,48] = 6.38; p =
      0.004). Two children on risperidone showed acute social phobia, which resolved
      with dose reduction in one subject but resulted in medication discontinuation in 
      the other. A mean increase in body weight of 2.8 kg was observed in the
      risperidone group compared to no change in placebo (F[2,64] = 10.68; p = 0.0001).
      No extrapyramidal symptoms and no clinically significant alterations in cardiac
      conduction times or laboratory measures were observed. CONCLUSION: Risperidone
      appears to be safe and effective for short-term treatment of tics in children or 
      adults with Tourette syndrome. Longer-term studies are needed to evaluate the
      durability of efficacy and safety over time.

TI  - Bipolar depression: criteria for treatment selection, definition of
      refractoriness, and treatment options.
PG  - 85-97
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews controlled studies of bipolar depression, outlines 
      criteria for choosing treatment, defines refractoriness in bipolar depression,
      and provides options for treatment of refractory bipolar depression. METHODS:
      Controlled studies that examined the efficacy of treatments for acute and
      long-term treatment of bipolar depression were located through electronic
      searches of several databases and by manual crosssearch of references and
      proceedings of international meetings. RESULTS: Lithium comes close to fulfilling
      the proposed criteria for first-line treatment for bipolar depression, and those 
      not responding to lithium should be considered to have refractory bipolar
      depression. Options for such patients include addition of lamotrigine or a second
      mood stabilizer, or a newer-generation antidepressant such as a serotonin
      re-uptake inhibitor or bupropion, or the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although there is a paucity of research in the treatment of
      refractory bipolar depression, available data could be used for providing
      rational treatment options for such patients. However, further studies are
      urgently needed to determine which options are most appropriate for which type of
      patients.

TI  - Valproate overdose: a comparative cohort study of self poisonings.
PG  - 398-404
AB  - AIMS: Based on individual case reports of massive overdoses, valproate is often
      regarded as having significant toxicity. This study aimed to describe the
      epidemiology of valproate poisoning and the spectrum of its clinical effects.
      METHODS: Consecutive valproate poisonings were identified and compared with other
      anticonvulsant overdoses and all other poisonings, from a prospective database of
      poisoning admissions presenting to a regional toxicology service. National
      prescription data for the same period were obtained. RESULTS: There were 79
      patients with valproate poisoning from January 1991 to November 2001, 15 cases
      with valproate alone. Of the 15 cases, drowsiness occurred in two patients (both 
      taking> 200 mg kg-1), vomiting occurred in four and tachycardia in five. In
      patients co-ingesting other medications, moderate to severe effects were
      consistent with the co-ingestants. There was one death not directly related to
      valproate. One patient had metabolic acidosis and thrombocytopaenia consistent
      with severe valproate toxicity. Comparison of valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin
      and control groups showed that length of stay for both phenytoin and
      carbamazepine was significantly longer than for valproate (P < 0.0001), and there
      was a significantly increased risk of intensive care unit admission for
      carbamazepine vs valproate (OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.22, 6.28; P = 0.015). Although
      valproate prescriptions increased over the 10 years, there was relatively greater
      increase in the incidence of valproate poisoning. The odds of a valproate
      overdose in 1992 compared with carbamazepine were 0.29 (95% CI 0.07, 1.28; P =
      0.141), but in 2001 were 2.73 (95% CI 1.38, 5.39; P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS:
      Valproate causes mild toxicity in the majority of cases. Massive overdoses of
      greater than 400 mg kg-1 can cause severe toxicity, but these are uncommon. The
      older anticonvulsants phenytoin and carbamazepine remain a greater problem than
      valproate in overdose.

TI  - Effects of acute procyclidine administration on prepulse inhibition of the
      startle response in schizophrenia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response refers to a reduction in
      response to a strong stimulus (pulse) if this is preceded shortly by a weak
      non-startling stimulus (prepulse). Consistent with theories of deficiencies in
      early stages of information processing, PPI is found to be reduced in patients
      with schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotics are found to be more effective than
      typical antipsychotics in improving PPI in this population. Anticholinergic drugs
      are often used to control extrapyramidal symptoms induced by antipsychotic
      medication, especially by typical antipsychotics, in schizophrenic patients and
      are known to disrupt cognitive functions in both normal and schizophrenic
      populations. The effect of anticholinergics on PPI in schizophrenia has not yet
      been examined. This study determined the effects of procyclidine, an
      anticholinergic drug, on PPI in patients with schizophrenia given risperidone or 
      quetiapine and not on any anticholinergic drugs, employing a placebo-controlled, 
      cross-over design. Under double-blind conditions, subjects were administered oral
      15 mg procyclidine and placebo on separate occasions, 2 weeks apart, and tested
      for acoustic PPI (prepulse 8 dB and 15 dB above the background and delivered with
      30-ms, 60-ms and 120-ms prepulse-to-pulse intervals). Procyclidine significantly 
      impaired PPI compared to placebo (assessed as percentage reduction) with 60-ms
      prepulse-to-pulse trials and increased the latencies to response peak across all 
      trials. The use of anticholinergics needs to be carefully controlled/examined in 
      investigations of information processing deficits using a PPI model and reduced
      to the minimum level in clinical care of schizophrenia.

TI  - Amisulpride versus risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenic patients: a
      double-blind pilot study in Taiwan.
PG  - 30-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The atypical antipsychotics, amisulpride and risperidone,
      have different receptor affinity characteristics. Although the relative efficacy 
      of both drugs compared to conventional antipsychotics is well established, it
      remains unclear how the efficacy of amisulpride compares with risperidone. There 
      have been no controlled studies comparing amisulpride to risperidone in Asian
      patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of
      amisulpride with that of risperidone in Taiwanese schizophrenic patients.
      METHODS: Patients with productive positive symptoms (n = 48) were enrolled into
      this double-blind, randomized pilot study for 6 weeks. Patients received either
      amisulpride (400-800 mg/day) or risperidone (4-8 mg/day). Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Social and Occupational
      Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), and patients' subjective responses to
      treatment were assessed during the trial period. Adverse events were recorded at 
      each follow-up visit. RESULTS: At the end of the trial, the mean dosage was 630
      +/- 134 mg/day and 6.88 +/- 1.54 mg/day for amisulpride and risperidone,
      respectively. There was no significant difference in the reduction of the PANSS
      total score (amisulpride -24.1 versus risperidone -28.4, p = 0.999), the PANSS
      positive subscale score (amisulpride -6.8 versus risperidone -8.3, p = 0.467),
      the PANSS negative subscale score (amisulpride -5.6 versus risperidone -6.4, p = 
      0.999), or the CGI score between the two groups. The extrapyramidal symptom
      ratings, the improvement in the SOFAS (amisulpride 11.1 versus risperidone 10.0) 
      and the subjective response (amisulpride 82% versus risperidone 83%) were
      comparable. No serious adverse events were recorded in either treatment group.
      There was a statistically significant body weight gain in the risperidone group. 
      In contrast, there was a statistically, though not clinically, significant
      reduction of blood pressure and heart rate in the amisulpride group. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study suggests that amisulpride is as effective as risperidone in the
      treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Both drugs were well tolerated, but had
      different side effect profiles.

TI  - Treatment of the psychotic patient who is violent.
PG  - 231-72
AB  - Aggression among patients with serious mental illness occurs relatively
      infrequently, but it is a significant concern for patients, relatives, mental
      health professionals, and the public. Recognition of this risk and providing
      access and continuity of appropriate psychiatric care should be major clinical
      and administrative objectives in the management of violence in psychotic
      patients. To date, pharmacologic approaches have been unclear and inconsistent.
      At present, typical antipsychotics continue to have a primary role in acute
      management and in long-term management, in which noncompliance necessitates the
      use of long-acting depot neuroleptic preparations. Atypical antipsychotics in
      acute and long-acting intramuscular forms doubtless will influence and expand the
      choice for acute management of hostile psychotic patients and the long-term
      management of poorly compliant patients who are at risk to become violent on
      relapse. Persistent aggression should be managed by atypical antipsychotics with 
      a preferential indication for clozapine, for which the most data on efficacy are 
      available. The role of adjunctive medications is presently unclear. A major focus
      of care should be to refine legal processes and to conduct intervention studies
      aimed at enhancing treatment compliance. Violence risk reduction is not only
      crucial from a societal perspective, but also it is a humanitarian necessity to
      alleviate the burden and stigma for patients with serious mental illness.

TI  - Understanding the new and evolving profile of adverse drug effects in
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 165-90
AB  - This article has reviewed the emerging side-effect profiles of second-generation 
      antipsychotic medications. Although these medications have favorable
      extrapyramidal side-effect profiles, clinicians must be aware of their propensity
      to cause weight gain, glucose and lipid abnormalities, and cardiac and sexual
      side effects. If clinicians are proactive about warning patients about these side
      effects and appropriately monitoring them, further morbidity and mortality may be
      prevented in this patient population. Initial choices of medication should be
      made based on the relative side-effect profiles in light of a particular
      patient's medical status. In the future, new treatments may be developed, with
      even fewer side effects.

TI  - The new and evolving pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia.
PG  - 141-63
AB  - Based on the evidence presented here, the following tentative conclusions can be 
      drawn. Atypical antipsychotics (except amisulpride) have shown superiority over
      placebo in acute schizophrenia. Compared with conventional antipsychotics, they
      are at least as effective. Generally, analyses employing conservative criteria
      (e.g., Cochrane reviews) report few efficacy differences between atypical and
      conventional agents. There are now many well-controlled studies indicating modest
      advantages for the atypical antipsychotics, however, particularly in specific
      symptom domains. For the treatment of negative symptoms, olanzapine and to a
      lesser extent amisulpride seem most promising. Risperidone, olanzapine, and
      quetiapine display advantages in improving cognitive and depressive symptoms.
      There are indications that the atypical antipsychotics are associated with
      decreased likelihood of rehospitalization and improved quality of life. In
      head-to-head comparisons of atypical antipsychotics, none have shown consistent
      efficacy advantages. In severely refractory samples, no atypical antipsychotics
      have consistently been shown to be as effective as clozapine or superior to
      conventional agents. There are indications, however, that risperidone,
      olanzapine, and quetiapine have advantages over conventional agents in less
      severely refractory patients. Few maintenance RCTs have been published, and
      efficacy advantages for atypical antipsychotics in prospective RCTs in
      first-episode schizophrenia have not been reported.

TI  - Schizophrenia in late life.
PG  - 103-13
AB  - Antipsychotics, whether conventional or atypical, are the primary class of
      medications for the treatment of late-life psychosis. Although the efficacy of
      neuroleptics in controlling agitation and psychosis associated with late-life
      dementia has been established, evidence for their efficacy in treating core
      symptoms of late-life schizophrenia other than behavioral dyscontrol is just
      emerging. More controlled clinical trials are needed. The available data suggest 
      that atypical neuroleptics are therapeutically efficacious, with a more favorable
      side-effect profile than conventional neuroleptics. This literature further
      suggests the importance of low therapeutic doses and careful attention to the
      emergence of side effects. Future studies must distinguish between patients with 
      true schizophrenic disorder and patients with psychosis secondary to dementia,
      affective illness, or organic impairment. Patients must be characterized further 
      as having EOS versus LOS because these disorders may differ in symptom profile,
      course, and response to treatment. There is also a need in future studies to
      separate out the results of treatment of patients with EOS who have been severely
      ill for most of their lives from those whose course has been less devastating.
      Within these two groups, treatment response, effective dose ranges, and
      sensitivity to side effects can be scrutinized more carefully.

TI  - Is schizophrenia a metabolic brain disorder? Membrane phospholipid dysregulation 
      and its therapeutic implications.
PG  - 85-102
AB  - The dysregulation of membrane phospholipid metabolism exists throughout the body 
      from the onset of psychosis in schizophrenic patients. This dysregulation is
      primarily due to altered contents of phospholipid bound EPUFAs, AA and DHA. These
      EPUFAs are highly enriched in the brain and are crucial for brain and behavioral 
      development. A phospholipid metabolic defect may preexist the onset of psychosis,
      even through early embryonic stages. Because these membrane phospholipids play a 
      crucial role in the membrane receptor-mediated signal transduction of several
      neuro-transmitters and growth factors, their altered metabolism may contribute to
      the reported abnormal information processing in schizophrenia. Severity of
      symptoms seems to correlate with the membrane AA and DHA status, which is
      influenced by patients' dietary intake and lifestyle. Such a metabolic defect can
      be prevented, however, and some membrane pathology can be corrected by dietary
      supplementation with a combination of AA and DHA and antioxidants such as
      vitamins E and C. In schizophrenia, it may be advisable to provide
      supplementation at the early stages of illness, when brain has a high degree of
      plasticity. Finally, at this time, supplementation has to be considered as an
      augmentation of conventional antipsychotic treatment.

TI  - Cognitive function in schizophrenia. Deficits, functional consequences, and
      future treatment.
PG  - 25-40
AB  - This article has discussed the relationship between cognitive deficits and
      functional outcome in schizophrenia. This relationship was noted first by
      Kraepelin and Bleuler at the beginning of the twentieth century. With the
      introduction of conventional neuroleptics, the focus shifted toward the treatment
      of positive symptoms. In the past few decades, cognitive dysfunction has been
      recognized as a fundamental feature of schizophrenia and has been shown
      repeatedly to have a negative association with functional outcome [6].
      Improvement in cognitive functioning became one of the most important clinical
      targets in the treatment of schizophrenia in the 1990s [82]. Main domains of
      cognition that are disrupted significantly in schizophrenia include attention,
      executive function, verbal and visuospatial working memory, and learning and
      memory. Although conventional antipsychotics are effective in treating positive
      symptoms, they lack the ability to improve cognitive impairment and produce poor 
      functional outcome. Previous research has shown superior efficacy of atypical
      antipsychotics on cognitive impairments in schizophrenia compared with
      conventional antipsychotics. Because the heterogeneity of atypical antipsychotics
      in their pharmacologic properties, they have differential profiles of cognitive
      efficacy in patients with schizophrenia. Establishing the cognitive profile of
      each atypical antipsychotic is an important task. This knowledge can be used to
      address individual cognitive problems and needs. Because cognitive deficits have 
      been shown to have associations with different aspects of clinical symptoms,
      limited learning in rehabilitation programs, and functional outcome in
      schizophrenia, targeting individual cognitive deficits would lead to greater
      treatment success in terms of clinical and functional outcome. Although atypical 
      antipsychotics have some benefit on cognitive function, further efforts to
      improve cognitive function are required. Attempts at improving cognition in
      schizophrenia with specific cognitive enhancers pharmacologically and
      psychological therapies such as cognitive remediation might lead to better
      functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Donepezil as add-on treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with dementia of 
      the Alzheimer's type.
PG  - 88-92
AB  - Traditionally, the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have
      been managed with neuroleptics or benzodiazepines, which have serious side
      effects. Preliminary observations suggest the possible value of cholinesterase
      inhibitors in the amelioration of psychotic symptoms in patients with dementia of
      the Alzheimer's type, dementia with Lewy bodies, and in patients with Parkinson's
      disease. Twelve inpatients with AD with psychotic symptoms and lack of
      improvement of their delusions/hallucinations during perphenazine treatment (8
      mg/day) for 3 weeks received random open-label donepezil 5 mg daily in addition
      to an ongoing treatment of 8 mg/day perphenazine or 16 mg/day perphenazine.
      Assessments conducted at baseline and after weeks 2 and 4 included the
      Mini-Mental State Examination, the Global Deterioration Scale, the Positive and
      Negative Symptoms Scale, and the Clinical Global Impressions scale. Frequency of 
      extrapyramidal symptoms was measured according to the Abnormal Involuntary
      Movement Scale. The donepezil-perphenazine group exhibited substantially greater 
      and clinical improvements in mental state. At the end of the trial (4 weeks),
      Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale scores revealed significant differences
      between both groups (p = 0.006). The Clinical Global Impressions scale and the
      Mini-Mental State Examination scores also showed significant differences between 
      the donepezil-perphenazine group and the perphenazine group (p = 0.028 and p =
      0.027 respectively). No significant differences were found in the Global
      Deterioration Scale scores. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores showed a
      significant deterioration in extrapyramidal symptoms in the perphenazine group
      compared with the donepezil-perphenazine group (p = 0.016). Donepezil
      augmentation of neuroleptics may be appropriate for those patients for whom
      neuroleptic monotherapy either does not lead to symptom remission or is
      associated with intolerable adverse effects. This was an open-label study and
      there is need for larger studies with double-blind control and a long-term study 
      design to define the efficacy of donepezil for patients with AD and psychotic
      symptoms.

TI  - High-dose olanzapine for treatment-refractory schizophrenia.
PG  - 58-61
AB  - To date there is no common or adequate therapeutic strategy for treatment of
      refractory schizophrenic patients. Increasing antipsychotics' doses in
      treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients is the most common intervention used
      by clinicians. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic, which in a number of
      double-blind, placebo-controlled studies has been found to be more effective than
      haloperidol for the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
      During the last few years there have been several reports of successful results
      in prescribing olanzapine at dosages of more than 25 mg/day for
      treatment-resistant schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. This report
      presents the results from the treatment of three resistant schizophrenic patients
      treated successfully with high dosages of olanzapine (35, 40, and 60 mg/day).
      None of the patients had any side effects, including abnormal laboratory levels
      and weight gain. The results and literature data suggest that in clinical
      practice some schizophrenic patients resistant to conventional neuroleptic
      treatment and not responding to olanzapine at recommended dosages as high as 20
      mg/day may respond to higher dosages such as 40 or 60 mg/day, and these dosages
      are well tolerated. Further prospective clinical studies are needed.

      Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 389-404
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This subanalysis of a large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
      examined the prevalence of behavioral symptoms in moderate to severe Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), and the effect of treatment with donepezil. METHODS: Two hundred
      ninety patients with moderate to severe AD (standardized Mini-Mental State
      Examination scores 5-17) were randomized to receive 24 weeks of once-daily doses 
      of donepezil 5 mg/day for 28 days, and 10 mg/day thereafter per the clinician's
      judgment (n = 144), or placebo (n = 146). The outcome measure of interest was the
      12-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). RESULTS: Baseline demographics were
      similar between the treatment groups. Least squares mean (+/- SE) baseline NPI
      12-item total scores were 19.55 +/- 1.48 and 19.30 +/- 1.45, respectively. At
      baseline, the most common symptoms were apathy/indifference (67%), aberrant motor
      behavior (53%), depression/dysphoria (52%), anxiety (49%), and
      agitation/aggression (45%). NPI individual item change from baseline scores at
      Week 24 using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis showed benefits 
      with donepezil treatment compared with placebo for all items, with significant
      treatment differences for depression/dysphoria, anxiety, and apathy/indifference 
      (p < .05). Symptoms present at baseline that improved significantly for
      donepezil- compared with placebo-treated patients at Week 24 LOCF included
      anxiety, apathy/indifference, and irritability/lability (p < .05). When patients 
      who were not receiving psychoactive medications at baseline were analyzed
      separately, significant improvements in NPI (continued) 12-item total score were 
      observed with donepezil compared with placebo at most visits and at Week 24 LOCF 
      (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral symptoms of the magnitude observed in this
      moderate to severe AD population improved with donepezil.

TI  - Ziprasidone in the treatment of acute bipolar mania: a three-week,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial.
PG  - 741-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone,
      compared with placebo, in the treatment of adult patients with acute bipolar
      mania. METHOD: Patients with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and
      a current manic or mixed episode (confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview 
      for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Patient Edition) (N=210) were randomly assigned in a
      2:1 ratio to 3 weeks of double-blind treatment with ziprasidone (40-80 mg twice
      daily) or placebo. Efficacy was assessed with the Schedule for Affective
      Disorders and Schizophrenia, Change Version (which contains the Mania Rating
      Scale), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impression (CGI)
      severity scale, CGI improvement scale, and Global Assessment of Functioning
      Scale. Primary efficacy variables were differences from baseline to endpoint
      (last observation carried forward) in mean Mania Rating Scale and CGI severity
      scale scores between the ziprasidone and placebo groups. Safety evaluations
      included monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram results,
      and clinical laboratory values and assessment of movement disorders and
      akathisia. RESULTS: Ziprasidone produced rapid, sustained improvements relative
      to baseline and placebo on all primary and most secondary efficacy measures at
      endpoint. Significant improvements were typically observed within 2 days after
      treatment commenced and were maintained throughout the 3 weeks. Ziprasidone was
      well tolerated and associated with a low rate of extrapyramidal symptoms; neither
      weight gain nor clinically significant changes in vital signs or other safety
      parameters were observed with ziprasidone. CONCLUSIONS: Ziprasidone monotherapy
      was significantly superior to placebo in reducing symptoms of acute mania in
      patients with bipolar I disorder. Onset of action was rapid, and tolerability of 
      ziprasidone was generally comparable to that of placebo.

TI  - Clozapine: in prevention of suicide in patients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 273-80; discussion 281-3
AB  - The atypical antipsychotic agent clozapine is associated with a lower propensity 
      for extrapyramidal symptoms than classical antipsychotic agents. The
      pharmacokinetics of clozapine are affected by wide interpatient variability and a
      potential for drug interactions. Some studies have shown a relationship between
      plasma concentrations, duration of treatment and antipsychotic clinical response.
      Clozapine (mean 274.2 mg/day; n = 490) had a greater preventive effect on
      suicidality among patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder at high
      risk for suicide than olanzapine (mean 16.6 mg/day; n = 490) in a randomised,
      rater-blinded, multicentre study (p < 0.05; a 22-24% improvement). Other
      prospective noncomparative trials of the effects of clozapine on suicidal
      ideation or attempts endorsed these results, while results from retrospective
      trials are equivocal. Clozapine is commonly associated with sedation,
      hypersalivation, tachycardia, dizziness, constipation and orthostatic
      hypotension. Agranulocytosis, diabetes mellitus and weight gain may also occur.

TI  - An economic review of compliance with medication therapy in the treatment of
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 508-16
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The authors examined published economic evaluations of schizophrenia 
      and antipsychotic therapies to determine the role of compliance with medication
      therapy in the economic cost of schizophrenia. METHODS: The authors reviewed
      studies published from 1995 to 2002 that evaluated compliance with treatment for 
      schizophrenia. Literature searches were conducted for that period by using
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Current Contents. The primary search terms were
      "schizophrenia," "compliance," "relapse," and "economic costs." RESULTS AND
      CONCLUSIONS: A definitive relationship exists between compliance and the economic
      costs of schizophrenia. Lower rates of compliance lead to higher costs of
      treating schizophrenia. However, the full implications are difficult to surmise
      from the literature because of inadequacies in the reporting of compliance rates 
      and outcomes of treatment over time. The authors suggest collection of data on
      longer-term clinical outcomes as a means to improve future economic evaluations
      of schizophrenia treatments.

TI  - Measurement of simple reaction time in antipsychotic treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 58-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of simple reaction time in schizophrenia has been
      extensively reported to date in professional literature. However, most studies
      have examined basic reaction time under static conditions using a single
      measurement. The aim of the present study was to establish whether any changes
      occur in simple reaction time during treatment with risperidone or olanzapine in 
      in-patients suffering a relapse of schizophrenia. METHODS: Seventeen in-patients 
      suffering acute relapse of schizophrenia (DSM IV criteria) and twenty matched,
      healthy controls participated in an eight-week, double-blind pilot study. The
      patients were treated with conventional antipsychotics for seven days after
      admission and were then randomised to the treatment arms with risperidone (4
      mg/day) or with olanzapine (10 mg/day) at a fixed dosage in the first week and
      thereafter in flexible dosages for the remaining seven weeks. Since no
      differences were found between reaction times of patients treated with
      risperidone or olanzapine, the two treatment groups were merged in the
      statistical analysis before being compared with the normal controls.
      Psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom
      Scale (PANSS) and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Simpson Angus Scale and
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Reaction time was measured with the Alpha
      apparatus, connected to a personal computer. All assessments and measurements
      were conducted four times during the treatment phase of the study. RESULTS: The
      reaction time of patients was significantly longer than that of the healthy
      controls (t1 = 17.11; p1 < 0.05). After eight weeks of treatment the reaction
      time of patients significantly improved but did not reach that of the healthy
      controls (t4 = 28.18, p4 < 0.05). Furthermore, the improved reaction time in the 
      patients did not correlate with improvement of psychopathological symptoms or
      with improved extrapyramidal symptoms. CONCLUSION: The results of the study
      suggest that simple reaction time can improve during treatment with atypical
      antipsychotics.

TI  - Rates of response, euthymia and remission in two placebo-controlled olanzapine
      trials for bipolar mania.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinically meaningful recovery from acute mania may not be captured by
      conventionally reported response categorizations. We defined new and stringent
      criteria for remission in bipolar mania. Using a cohort of patients with acute
      mania randomized to treatment with either olanzapine or placebo, we contrasted
      remission rates to findings using previously reported but more lenient
      categorical outcome measures of response and euthymia. METHODS: We pooled and
      reanalyzed results through 3 weeks from two published randomized double-blind
      trials of olanzapine versus placebo for treating acute bipolar mania (1, 2).
      Response was previously defined as > or = 50% decrease from baseline to endpoint 
      total Young Mania Rating Scale (3) (Y-MRS) scores, and euthymia as an endpoint
      total Y-MRS score of < or = 12. In this report, remission required an endpoint
      total Y-MRS score of < or = 7, and an endpoint total Hamilton Depression Rating
      Scale, (HAM-D21) (4) score of < or = 7 and an endpoint Clinical Global Impression
      Scale - Bipolar version, CGI-BP (5), overall severity score of < or = 2. RESULTS:
      Olanzapine treated subjects achieved statistically significantly greater rates of
      clinical response, euthymia and remission than those assigned to placebo, 55%
      versus 29.5%, 50% versus 27%, and 18% versus 7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      Olanzapine monotherapy resulted in discernable clinical improvements in mania in 
      over 50% of subjects and just under 20% of subjects achieved a near complete
      resolution of manic and accompanying depressive symptoms after 3 weeks of
      treatment. Full remission is an important but potentially elusive goal during
      short-term management of acute mania.

TI  - A retrospective cohort study of diabetes mellitus and antipsychotic treatment in 
      the United States.
PG  - 164-70
AB  - Treatment-emergent diabetes mellitus (DM) has been described for conventional and
      atypical antipsychotics. In our study, antipsychotic prescription claims from
      AdvancePCS's database were used to identify patients starting antipsychotic
      monotherapy. The relative risk of developing DM was determined using prescription
      claims for antidiabetic agents in the following cohorts: AdvancePCS general
      patient population, combined conventional antipsychotics, and combined atypical
      antipsychotics. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for
      differences in age, gender, and duration of antipsychotic exposure between
      cohorts in the estimation of risk of developing diabetes. Hazard ratios for
      developing DM in the combined conventional, combined atypical, and individual
      conventional and atypical antipsychotic treatment cohorts were greater than the
      AdvancePCS general patient population cohort. An increased risk of developing
      diabetes compared with the AdvancePCS general patient population was observed
      during treatment with conventional or atypical antipsychotics.

TI  - Effect of the 5-HT2 antagonist mianserin on cognitive dysfunction in chronic
      schizophrenia patients: an add-on, double-blind placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 123-8
AB  - Preponderance of serotonin 5-HT2A antagonism over dopamine D2 blockade exerted by
      atypical antipsychotics may contribute to their cognitive-enhancing effect. In a 
      double-blind placebo-controlled study we examined the effect of add-on mianserin 
      (15 mg/day), an agent with marked 5-HT2A antagonism, on cognitive functioning in 
      30 chronic hospitalized DSM-IV schizophrenia patients stabilized on typical
      antipsychotics. The Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM)
      battery was used to assess learning, memory and sustained attention; Wisconsin
      Card Sorting Test (WCST) to assess executive function at baseline and endpoint (4
      weeks). Clinical assessment included appropriate rating scales. The mianserin
      group overperformed the placebo group on selective ANAM memory/learning tests,
      reflected in moderate-to-high effect size values. No between-group differences
      were revealed in WCST and clinical ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Improved performance on 
      selective neurocognitive tests with addition of the 5-HT2A antagonist mianserin
      to typical antipsychotics indicates a possible role of the 5-HT system in
      cognitive-enhancing effects. The effect of flexible doses of mianserin on
      cognitive deficits in a broader schizophrenia population merits further
      investigation.

AB  - Weight gain is associated with treatment with olanzapine and other psychotropic
      agents. Nizatidine, a histamine H-2 receptor antagonist, has been proposed to
      have weight-reducing effects. This double-blind trial evaluated the efficacy of
      nizatidine in limiting weight gain in patients with schizophrenia and related
      disorders who were treated with olanzapine for up to 16 weeks. After an initial
      screening period, 175 patients were randomized to receive olanzapine (5-20 mg)
      with either placebo or nizatidine (150 mg b.i.d. or 300 mg b.i.d.). Significantly
      less weight gain was observed on average at weeks 3 and 4 with
      olanzapine+nizatidine 300 mg b.i.d. (P<0.05) compared to olanzapine+placebo, but 
      the difference was not statistically significant at 16 weeks. Nizatidine was
      well-tolerated and did not adversely affect clinical outcomes. Nizatidine 300 mg 
      b.i.d. may have an early transient effect in limiting the weight gain, but this
      potential early effect appeared to be diminished or eliminated by 16 weeks.

TI  - What are the effects of antipsychotics on sexual dysfunctions and endocrine
      functioning?
PG  - 109-23
AB  - The literature is reviewed and preliminary results of new studies are presented
      showing that treatment with classical antipsychotics, as well as risperidone,
      induces sexual dysfunctions in 30-60% of the patients. These antipsychotics also 
      frequently induce amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea. Although comparative studies are
      rare, it is likely that prolactin-sparing antipsychotics, as recently shown in a 
      randomized trial of olanzapine versus risperidone, induce less sexual side
      effects.From these studies, it becomes apparent that prolactin elevation induced 
      by classical antipsychotics and risperidone is probably a factor in inducing
      sexual dysfunctions, amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea. The role of other factors
      inducing sexual dysfunctions like sedation, proportional, variant -blockade,
      testosterone, dopamine, and serotonin is discussed. Finally, it is concluded that
      sexual and hormonal effects of antipsychotics, although clearly important, are
      often neglected in research as in clinical practice. Lowering the dosage or
      switching to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic often reduces sexual side effects,
      amenorrhoea, and galactorrhoea.

      recent-onset psychosis.
PG  - 47-57
AB  - The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a widely used instrument for 
      measuring severe psychopathology in adult patients with schizophrenia. Data,
      primarily on chronic patients, have been used to define factors for the PANSS.
      The present study examines the PANSS factor structure in a large sample of
      subjects with recent-onset schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder and
      schizoaffective disorder who had been exposed to very limited antipsychotic
      medication. Equamax factor analysis was conducted on PANSS baseline assessments
      from a multicenter, 11 country drug trial that enrolled 535 patients. The forced 
      five-factor solution essentially corresponds to the factors most frequently
      described previously, namely negative, positive, disorganized (or cognitive),
      excited and anxiety/depression. In the exploratory analysis, a seven-factor
      solution was obtained, with depression and anxiety symptoms separating and a
      motor component emerging. The results of this study partially support the use of 
      a five-factor model for the PANSS, but suggest that scales for catatonia,
      depressive and anxiety syndromes should be included in future studies.

      versus placebo in patients at risk of being prodromally symptomatic for
      psychosis. II. Baseline characteristics of the "prodromal" sample.
PG  - 19-30
AB  - The first double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of an atypical
      neuroleptic medication is being conducted in symptomatic treatment-seeking
      patients meeting new diagnostic criteria for a putative prodromal syndrome. This 
      identifies them as being at high risk for developing psychosis in the near
      future. The study aims include prevention of psychosis onset and disability, as
      well as palliation of ongoing symptomatology. The purpose of this report is to
      describe the study's "prodromally symptomatic" sample at baseline, i.e., at
      intake immediately prior to randomization and prior to receiving study
      medication. Sixty treatment-seeking patients meeting prodromal inclusion criteria
      were recruited across four sites: New Haven, CT (n=39), Toronto, Ontario (n=9),
      Calgary, Alberta (n=6), and Chapel Hill, NC (n=6). The sample was young (median
      age 16), largely male (65%), and came from families with high titers of serious
      mental illness (44%). Most patients (93%) met criteria for the Attenuated
      Positive Symptom (APS) prodromal syndrome and presented with significant but
      nonpsychotic suspiciousness, perceptual aberrations, unusual thought content, and
      conceptual disorganization. They presented with minimal to mild affective
      symptoms and substance use/abuse, but they were quite functionally compromised
      (mean Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score=42). The prodromal sample was 
      compared with other clinical-trial samples of adolescent depression, adolescent
      mania, and first episode schizophrenia. Prodromal patients proved not to be
      depressed or manic. They were less severely ill than untreated first episode
      schizophrenia but more severely ill than treated first episode schizophrenia.
      While not psychotically disabled, these patients nevertheless present with a
      clinical syndrome. Subsequent reports will detail the effects of drug versus
      placebo on prodromal symptoms, neuropsychological profile, and the rate of
      conversion to psychosis.

      knowledge about the early course of schizophrenia and our ability to predict
      onset prospectively, advances that have rendered prodromal intervention research 
      feasible and ethical. The study design has many novel features. It tests for
      prevention versus delay in psychosis onset, as well as for efficacy and safety in
      a newly defined clinical population. This has required the development of
      innovative clinical research assessment instruments and a new operational
      definition of psychosis onset. The integration of these novel elements into an
      otherwise typical clinical trial design is detailed. The companion report will
      address sample recruitment and the clinical phenomenology at baseline of this
      putative "prodromal" entity.

TI  - [Effects of quetiapine at low doses on psychosis motor disability and stress of
      the caregiver in patients with Parkinson's disease].
PG  - 401-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Quetiapine is a novel neuroleptic drug with pharmacological
      properties close to clozapine, the most effective drug in the management of
      psychotic symptoms in patients with Parkinson s disease (PD). Unlike clozapine,
      however, quetiapine does not induce agranulocytosis and therefore no haematologic
      controls are required. OBJECTIVES: To assess tolerability and effectiveness of
      low dose quetiapine on psychotic symptoms, sleep disturbances and stress of the
      caregiver in PD patients with dopaminomimetic psychosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We
      carried out a 16 week, prospective, open label study on the effects of quetiapine
      in 7 consecutive PD patients with psychosis. A ceiling dose was arbitrarily
      established at 25 mg/d. Antiparkinsonian medication remained unchanged throughout
      the study. Motor symptoms were assessed with UPDRS motor subscale portion, Schwab
      England scale, and Hoehn Yahr diseases staging. The effects on hallucinations and
      paranoia, sleep disorder, and stress in the caregiver were scored separately,
      aside from a global score on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Global
      impression of both, investigators and caregiver was obtained at study conclusion.
      A patient died from unrelated causes. RESULTS: Under a mean quetiapine dose of
      24.9 mg/d (12.5 37.2) motor impairment during on periods remained unchanged, both
      according to patients and caregiver whereas mean UPDRS motor score remained
      unchanged (35.5 4.5 versus 32.8 5.2). Levodopa induced dyskinesias disappeared in
      the single patient with this complication. Improvement occurred in mean NPI
      global score, as well as subscores for hallucinations and paranoia, and caregiver
      stress. In over half the patients, effectiveness was scored as very good or good 
      both by examiners and caregivers. A confusional episode occurred in one patient
      under 25 mg/d but readily resolved while maintaining the benefit following dose
      reduction to 12.5 mg. CONCLUSION: Quetiapine at low doses appears a useful
      alternative for psychotic symptoms, sleep disorders and stress of the caregiver
      in patients with PD

TI  - [Criteria defining antimanic drugs (psychopharmacological specificity and/or
      nonspecificity?)].
PG  - 59-67
AB  - The question as to whether specific antimanic drugs differ in their action
      profile from nonspecific drugs is addressed in regard to symptomatic,
      nosographic, regulatory and physiopathological issues. Results from clinical
      studies have shown that mood stabilizers and typical neuroleptics differ as
      regards improvement of manic symptoms: the former appear to act more evenly on
      all symptoms of mania, showing a more total normalization of affect, ideation and
      behaviour whereas the latter tend to sedate patients or to cause a psychomotor
      retardation, leaving the core manic symptoms unaffected. This has been many times
      underlined, in particular for lithium, notwithstanding the fact that rating
      scales employed in clinical trials have often been charged to fall far short of
      being sensitive enough to pick up the qualitative changes in manic
      psychopathology. Antimanic drugs may also be more or less specific in their
      capacities to treat all facets of the manic episode (psychotic, depressive,
      irritable) whatever the bipolar subtype (bipolar I, II, rapid and non-rapid
      cycling, secondary bipolar disorder) or the disease stage (early and late
      episodes). In this respect divalproate seems to have a broader spectrum of
      efficacy than other available agents. Newer antipsychotics such as olanzapine are
      promising too. From a regulatory point of view, the current European requirements
      for a specific antimanic drug are more stringent than the US requirements of the 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Efficacy must be demonstrated in short-term
      studies showing an effect in acute mania; moreover it has to be shown that
      efficacy is to be maintained during the episode. So far, three armed randomized
      controlled trials are required, in which the test product is compared both with
      placebo and with a standard treatment. A possible design is a comparison of test 
      product, placebo and active control for 3 weeks followed by a two-arm phase for
      the remaining 9 weeks, comparing only test product and active control. In
      addition, a specific antimanic has to demonstrate that it does not cause
      switching to depression. As regards physiopathology, integrative models of
      bipolar disorder, ie kindling and behavioural sensitization, offer an exciting
      perspective on the specificity issue; agents active in these models initialize a 
      cascade of intracellular signaling that leads to changes in the expression of
      immediate early genes as well as late effector genes in corticolimbic structures:
      the former may contribute to acute symptomatology whereas the latter give rise to
      neuroanatomical reorganization which could underlie more stable changes in mood
      and cognition. Due to their action on intracellular messaging systems, dopamine
      D(1) receptors, serotonin 5HT(1a) or 5HT(2a) receptors, especially in
      orbitofrontal circuit, antimanic agents may exhibit a more specific activity than
      other drugs. This specificity could concern a whole spectrum of bipolarity which 
      might be characterized by impulsivity.

TI  - Low-dose risperidone as adjunctive therapy for irritable aggression in
      posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 193-6
AB  - Increased aggressive behavior can occur in association with posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD). This study tested the hypothesis that low-dose risperidone
      reduces aggression and other PTSD-related symptoms in combat veterans. Subjects
      were male combat veterans with PTSD who scored 20 or higher on cluster D
      (hyperarousal) of the Patient Checklist for PTSD-Military Version (PCL-M).
      Subjects were randomly assigned to either risperidone or placebo treatment
      groups. Drugs were administered over a 6-week treatment period in a double-blind 
      manner. Subjects received either risperidone (0.5 mg/day; n = 7) or matched
      placebo (n = 8) tablets during the first 2 weeks of the treatment period. The
      dose of risperidone could then be increased up to 2.0 mg/day on the basis of
      response. Prerandomization psychotropic regimens were continued. Subjects were
      evaluated with the PCL-M and the Overt Aggression Scale-Modified for Outpatients 
      (OAS-M). In comparison with placebo treatment, reductions in scores between
      baseline and the last week of treatment were significantly greater for OAS-M
      irritability and PCL-M cluster B (intrusive thoughts) subscales and on the PCL-M 
      total scale. These results suggest that low-dose risperidone administration
      reduces irritability and intrusive thoughts in combat-related PTSD.

TI  - Short-acting parenteral antipsychotics drive choice for classical versus atypical
      agents.
PG  - 757-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate which antipsychotics
      (classical versus atypical) are prescribed in a psychiatric hospital and which
      determinants affect the choice for one of these two classes of antipsychotics in 
      newly admitted patients. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort design, 522 newly
      admitted patients were followed from the date of admission until discharge from
      the hospital. In the cohort of newly admitted patients treated with an oral
      antipsychotic, a nested case-control study was conducted considering recipients
      of an atypical agent as cases. Controls were all other cohort members. The
      association of patient characteristics and the choice between classical versus
      atypical antipsychotics was studied using logistic regression analysis. The same 
      analysis was performed with adjustment for possible confounding factors (age
      group, gender, DSM-IV diagnoses, use of short-acting parenteral antipsychotic,
      global assessment of functioning score, involuntary admissions and involuntary
      measures). RESULTS: Patients treated with classical oral antipsychotics were more
      often previously treated with short-acting parenteral antipsychotics than
      patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (40.8% vs 15.2%; adjusted OR=0.20
      95% CI=0.09-0.44). No statistically significant difference was found between
      patients with different severities of disease. DISCUSSION: Availability of
      injectable forms seems to drive the choice for oral antipsychotic agents. Future 
      introductions of short-acting parenteral atypical antipsychotics may have a large
      impact on first-choice oral antipsychotic treatment.

TI  - Do atypical antipsychotics fail to exert cognitive sparing effects?
PG  - 505-9
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate patterns of the P600 component of
      event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited during a working memory test in 16 male 
      schizophrenic patients experiencing auditory hallucinations before and after
      treatment with clozapine and olanzapine, and 13 male normal subjects matched for 
      age and educational level. Before treatment, patients showed significantly
      reduced P600 amplitudes on the right parietal region compared with controls, and 
      when in remission also showed significantly reduced P600 amplitudes located on
      the right parietal and temporofrontal areas, compared both to themselves before
      treatment and to normal controls. The patient's memory performance before and
      after treatment remained significantly lower than that of healthy controls. These
      findings may indicate that auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia are
      associated with impaired synchronization of the processes related to target
      detection, as reflected by the P600. The present study also casts doubts
      regarding the cognitive sparing effect of atypical antipsychotics, despite the
      fact that they mediate symptom improvement.

TI  - Low blood selenium concentrations in schizophrenic patients on clozapine.
PG  - 307-9
AB  - AIMS: To compare plasma and red-cell selenium concentrations of schizophrenic
      patients treated with clozapine, with healthy controls and patients with mood
      disorders. METHODS: Plasma and red-cell selenium concentrations were measured in 
      random venous blood samples from four groups: mood disorder (n = 36),
      schizophrenics treated with clozapine (n = 54), schizophrenics not treated with
      clozapine (n = 41) and a healthy control group (n = 56). Assays were performed by
      an independent laboratory that was blinded to the patient groups and specializes 
      in estimating trace metal concentrations. RESULTS: Selenium concentrations in
      plasma and red cells were found to be significantly lower in schizophrenic
      patients treated with clozapine as compared with all other groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Selenium is an essential antioxidant. Its deficiency has been implicated in
      myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Low selenium concentrations in clozapine-treated 
      patients may be important in the pathogenesis of life threatening cardiac
      side-effects associated with clozapine. Further clinical studies are being
      conducted to explore this important clinical observation and its therapeutic
      implications.

TI  - Treatment of weight gain with fluoxetine in olanzapine-treated schizophrenic
      outpatients.
PG  - 527-9
AB  - Significant weight gain is a side effect associated with olanzapine treatment in 
      some patients. We investigated the efficacy of high-dose fluoxetine as a
      weight-reducing agent for patients who develop early weight gain with olanzapine 
      treatment. Patients that gained >/=3% of their baseline weight in the initial 8
      weeks of olanzapine treatment (n=31) were randomized to double-blind treatment
      with placebo or fluoxetine (60 mg/day). Clinical, weight, and weight-related
      measures were assessed. Fluoxetine failed to demonstrate weight-reducing effects 
      (fluoxetine group: baseline mean 80.5 kg, SD=19.1, last mean=83.5 kg, SD=19.8;
      placebo group: baseline mean=77.1 kg, SD=12.1, last mean=78.8 kg, SD=10.6; F=1.3;
      df=1, 18; p=0.3). There were no differential effects in psychopathology,
      extrapyramidal side effects or weight-related measures between the placebo and
      fluoxetine groups. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are probably not a practical
      option to counteract weight gain induced by atypical antipsychotics.
      Atypical-induced weight gain may result from mechanisms other than 5HT reuptake
      blockade.

TI  - Association between CYP2D6 genotype and tardive dyskinesia in Korean
      schizophrenics.
PG  - 400-7
AB  - The CYP2D6 gene codes for human cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme, which is responsible 
      for the metabolism of many psychiatric drugs. In schizophrenic patients treated
      with neuroleptics, decreased or loss of function CYP2D6 alleles may contribute to
      the development of tardive dyskinesia (TD), a movement disorder that frequently
      occurs with chronic neuroleptic treatment. The goal of this study was to
      determine whether the occurrence of TD is associated with CYP2D6 genotype in a
      cohort of Korean schizophrenics by employing a CYP450 GeneChip((R))
      oligonucleotide microarray and PCR assays to screen for 19 CYP2D6 alleles. Our
      results revealed that males with at least one decreased or loss of function
      allele have a moderately greater chance of developing TD than males with only
      wild-type alleles. Female schizophrenics did not have a significantly greater
      chance of developing TD. Our results demonstrate the utility of CYP2D6
      microarrays to assess genotype status in this Korean cohort.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and safety assessments of concurrent administration of
      risperidone and donepezil.
PG  - 180-6
AB  - Treatment of Alzheimer's disease sometimes uses combinations of drugs because
      dementia is frequently associated with behavioral symptoms. Risperidone and
      donepezil are both metabolized through cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4, raising the
      possibility of drug interactions with combination therapy. The objective of this 
      study was to determine whether significant drug interactions occur with
      concomitant administration of donepezil and risperidone. In an open-label,
      three-way crossover study, 24 healthy men were randomly assigned to receive 0.5
      mg of risperidone twice daily, 5 mg of donepezil once daily, or both drugs for 14
      consecutive days, followed by a 21-day washout period. The treatment ratios of
      AUC and associated 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for risperidone active moiety, 
      defined as risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone (ratio = 110.2%; 90% CI =
      103.7-117.2), and for donepezil (ratio = 97.1%; 90% CI = 90.0-103.6) were within 
      the 80% to 125% of bioequivalence range. The treatment ratios of Cmax and
      associated 90% CIs for risperidone active moiety (ratio = 114.6%; 90% CI =
      107.0-122.8) and for donepezil (ratio = 96.1%; 90% CI = 90.0-102.6) were also
      within the bioequivalence range. Therefore, no significant pharmacokinetic
      differences occurred in either risperidone active moiety or donepezil when given 
      alone or in combination. Adverse events (predominantly headache, nervousness, and
      somnolence) were minor and comparable for all treatment groups. The results
      indicate that no clinically meaningful drug interactions occurred between
      risperidone 1 mg daily and donepezil 5 mg daily at steady state, and therefore no
      dosage adjustment is required when both drugs are combined with the dosage
      regimen studied. Additional investigations are warranted to determine the
      potential for interactions in elderly patients with dementia who may eliminate
      risperidone and donepezil more slowly and thus be more vulnerable to clinical
      drug interactions than the young healthy subjects examined in this study.

TI  - Switching patients to aripiprazole from other antipsychotic agents: a multicenter
      randomized study.
PG  - 391-9
AB  - RATIONALE: Switching patients from one antipsychotic to another can lead to
      tolerability problems or transient symptom exacerbations. It is important to
      compare switching strategies to determine which methods produce the best possible
      patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability
      of three dosing strategies for switching chronic, stable patients with
      schizophrenia from current oral antipsychotic monotherapy to once-daily oral
      aripiprazole monotherapy. METHOD: Patients in this 8-week, open-label, outpatient
      study were randomized to: 1). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole with
      simultaneous immediate discontinuation of current antipsychotic; 2). immediate
      initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole while tapering off current antipsychotic
      over 2 weeks; or 3). up-titrating aripiprazole to 30 mg/day over 2 weeks, while
      simultaneously tapering off current antipsychotic. Efficacy assessments included 
      PANSS, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores. Safety assessments included: adverse events (AEs)
      recording, evaluation of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), vital signs, ECG, and
      clinical laboratory tests. RESULTS: Efficacy with aripiprazole was maintained
      during the study with numerical improvements compared with baseline in all three 
      groups. The overall incidence of AEs was broadly comparable across all groups,
      and AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity and time-limited.
      Discontinuations due to AEs were comparable across the groups. No deterioration
      in EPS occurred in any group. The reduction in body weight and plasma prolactin
      levels following switch to aripiprazole were comparable across the three groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Any of the three strategies evaluated can be used safely for
      switching patients to aripiprazole from antipsychotic monotherapy. Furthermore,
      patients' symptoms may continue to improve after switching to aripiprazole.

TI  - Atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilization in bipolar disorder.
PG  - 315-32
AB  - The available literature on the use of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment 
      of bipolar disorder was reviewed. All uncontrolled and controlled reports were
      identified through a comprehensive Medline search. Based on the available
      evidence, olanzapine was found to be the most appropriate atypical antipsychotic 
      agent utilized for the treatment of manic bipolar patients, although there is
      also preliminary data suggesting the efficacy of risperidone and clozapine. The
      preliminary data evaluating the efficacy of quetiapine and ziprasidone in bipolar
      disorder are still very limited. Double-blind controlled studies with atypical
      antipsychotics in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder are still largely
      not available, but will be critical to determine the effectiveness of these
      agents in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. There are recent
      uncontrolled suggestions that olanzapine may have beneficial effects in depressed
      bipolar patients, which deserve further investigation in controlled studies. In
      conclusion, atypical antipsychotics, due to lower potential for neurotoxicity and
      preliminary evidence suggesting better efficacy than typical antipsychotics, are 
      increasingly having a more prominent role in the pharmacological management of
      bipolar patients. Nonetheless, until there is systematic data from long-term
      controlled follow-up studies on the comparative efficacy of these agents with
      mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics should be cautiously utilized, and
      preferably in combination with a mood stabilizer for the maintenance phase of
      treatment.

TI  - Dopamine D3 receptor gene Ser9Gly variant and schizophrenia: association study
      and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To further evaluate the controversial putative association between a
      Ser9Gly variant in the first exon of the dopamine D3 receptor gene (DRD3) and
      schizophrenia. METHODS: Swedish patients with schizophrenia ( n=156) and control 
      subjects ( n=463) were assessed for the DRD3 Ser9Gly variant. Meta-analyses
      including previous and the present Swedish case-control results were performed.
      RESULTS: No significant difference between the Swedish patients and controls were
      found, but there was an association between DRD3 Ser9Gly Ser/Ser and homozygous
      genotypes and response to anti-psychotic drugs. This finding was supported by an 
      incomplete meta-analysis. In a meta-analysis of all case-control studies
      comprising 8761 subjects the association between DRD3 Ser9Gly homozygosity and
      schizophrenia ( =4.96, degree of freedom=1, p <0.05, odds ratio=1.10, 95%
      confidence interval=1.01-1.20) persisted. However, the previously proposed
      association between the Ser/Ser genotype and schizophrenia was not significant
      (chi2 =2.71, degree of freedom=1, p>0.05, odds ratio=1.08, 95% confidence
      interval=0.99-1.17). CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the present Swedish case-control
      analysis did not yield any evidence for association with the diagnosis, the
      present meta-analysis suggests that the DRD3 gene confer susceptibility to
      schizophrenia. Reasons for the discrepancies between prior studies are discussed.

TI  - Intramuscular preparations of antipsychotics: uses and relevance in clinical
      practice.
PG  - 493-512
AB  - Intramuscular formulations of antipsychotics can be sub-divided into two groups
      on the basis of their pharmacokinetic features: short-acting preparations and
      long-acting or depot preparations. Short-acting intramuscular formulations are
      used to manage acute psychotic episodes. On the other hand, long-acting
      compounds, also called "depot", are administered as antipsychotic maintenance
      treatment to ensure compliance and to eliminate bioavailability problems related 
      to absorption and first pass metabolism. Adverse effects of antipsychotics have
      been studied with particular respect to oral versus short- and long-acting
      intramuscular formulations of the different compounds. For short-term
      intramuscular preparations the main risk with classical compounds are hypotension
      and extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Data on the incidence of EPS with depot
      formulations are controversial: some studies point out that the incidence of EPS 
      is significantly higher in patients receiving depot preparations, whereas others 
      show no difference between oral and depot antipsychotics. Studies on the
      strategies for switching patients from oral to depot treatment suggest that this 
      procedure is reasonably well tolerated, so that in clinical practice depot
      antipsychotic therapy is usually begun while the oral treatment is still being
      administered, with gradual tapering of the oral dose. Efficacy, pharmacodynamics 
      and clinical pharmacokinetics of haloperidol decanoate, fluphenazine enanthate
      and decanoate, clopenthixol decanoate, zuclopenthixol decanoate and acutard,
      flupenthixol decanoate, perphenazine enanthate, pipothiazine palmitate and
      undecylenate, and fluspirilene are reviewed. In addition, the intramuscular
      preparations of atypical antipsychotics and clinical uses are reviewed.
      Olanzapine and ziprasidone are available only as short-acting preparations, while
      risperidone is to date the only novel antipsychotic available as depot
      formulation. To date, acutely ill, agitated psychotic patients have been treated 
      with high parenteral doses of typical antipsychotics, which often cause serious
      EPS, especially dystonic reactions. Intramuscular formulations of novel
      antipsychotics (olanzapine and ziprasidone), which appear to have a better
      tolerability profile than typical compounds, showed an equivalent efficacy to
      parenteral typical agents in the acute treatment of psychoses. However,
      parenteral or depot formulations of atypical antipsychotics are not yet widely
      available.

TI  - Plasma levels of homovanillic acid and the response to risperidone in first
      episode untreated acute schizophrenia.
PG  - 107-11
AB  - We have previously reported that risperidone might improve negative symptoms in
      schizophrenia by influencing noradrenergic neurons. In the present study, we
      focused on the clinical efficacy and mechanisms of risperidone towards positive
      symptoms in the acute phase of schizophrenia. Thirty-four patients meeting DSM-IV
      criteria for schizophrenia and treated with risperidone alone were evaluated
      regarding their clinical improvement using the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale (PANSS) before and 2 weeks after risperidone administration, and blood
      samples were also drawn at the same times. Plasma concentrations of homovanillic 
      acid (HVA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol were analysed by high-performance 
      liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Plasma HVA levels in the
      responders to the risperidone treatment (more than 50% improvement in scores of
      positive symptoms in PANSS) were higher than those of non-responders before
      risperidone administration. Furthermore, there was a negative trend between
      changes in plasma HVA levels and improvement of total scores for positive
      symptoms in PANSS. These results suggest that higher levels of plasma HVA before 
      risperidone administration might be a predictor of a good response to risperidone
      treatment, and the influence of risperidone on dopaminergic activity might be
      associated with its efficacy in treating symptoms of schizophrenia in the acute
      phase.

TI  - [Psychotherapy of positive symptoms in the treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia psychosis].
PG  - 76-84
AB  - While the treatment of positive symptoms of patients with schizophrenic psychosis
      appeared until recently to be solely pharmacotherapeutic, new research findings
      show the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy (CBT) on positive
      symptoms in chronic psychotic patients. In addition, the effectiveness even in
      acute and recent-onset psychosis could be shown in some studies. The effects of
      CBT and standard care in psychosis compared to standard care alone and to other
      psychosocial interventions plus standard care are reviewed. The results of
      several studies and one meta-analysis show that CBT in schizophrenia patients has
      a direct effect on psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations as well as on
      relapse prevention. In routine settings,however,CBT has until now only rarely
      been delivered to these patients. In so-called large pragmatic trials, which
      might be subsumed as phase IIIb studies, the effects are tested. The therapeutic 
      approach with the components of CBT for psychosis are described: building a
      therapeutic relationship, cognitive-behavioural coping strategies, developing an 
      understanding of the experience of psychosis,working on hallucinations and
      delusions, addressing negative self-evaluations, anxiety, and depression,managing
      risk of relapse and social disability. Further clinical implications are
      described (capability of learning the therapeutic strategies, deliverability in
      broader clinical settings, acceptability by patients, combination with atypical
      neuroleptic drugs,and treatment of choice in risk populations).

TI  - [New treatment for bipolar disorder in children and adolescents: learning from
      adult studies].
PG  - 40-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to 45% of bipolar patients fail to respond adequately to or do not
      tolerate treatment with standard antimanics (lithium, valproate, carbamazepine,
      or olanzapine). Several new potential normothymic and antimanic treatments are
      under study. However, there is less literature available on new treatments for
      bipolar disorder in children and adolescents, but many youths with manic symptoms
      are treated with mood stabilizers. Our goal was to review the current literature 
      on alternatives to lithium, valproate and carbamazepine in the treatment of
      bipolar disorder in children, adolescents and adults, focusing on the potential
      uses of these drugs in youth. METHODS: In a comprehensive computerized and manual
      literature search in Medline, we identified articles, abstracts and book chapters
      describing new treatments for bipolar disorder in children, adolescent, and
      adults. We also manually searched the abstracts in recent APA, AACAP and ECNP
      Annual Meetings. RESULTS: There are very few studies on the treatment of youths
      with bipolar disorder. The strongest evidence of antimanic action in this age
      group is on lithium, valproate, and recently on olanzapine, and adjunctive
      risperidone. Evidence on new antiepileptics and other novel treatments is very
      limited or none. CONCLUSION: More controlled studies on the treatment of children
      and adolescents with bipolarity are needed. Lithium, valproate, olanzapine and
      risperidone are probably the drugs with more evidence as antimanic efficacy in
      children and adolescents, but potential risks and benefits of treatment versus no
      treatment must be discussed with parents.

TI  - Aripiprazole: a review of its pharmacology and clinical use.
PG  - 49-54
AB  - Atypical antipsychotics generally have a lower propensity for extrapyramidal
      side-effects (EPSE), hyperprolactinaemia and tardive dyskinesia than that
      associated with typical antipsychotics but may still produce troublesome
      side-effects, such as weight gain, cardiac rhythm changes and impaired glucose
      tolerance. Aripiprazole is a new atypical antipsychotic with a unique receptor
      binding profile that combines partial agonist activity at D2 and 5HT1A receptors 
      with potent antagonism at 5HT2A receptors. Clinical studies in acute
      schizophrenic relapse, chronic schizophrenia and acute mania show it is robustly 
      more effective than placebo. Once-daily aripiprazole 15-30 mg is as effective as 
      haloperidol 10 mg/day and risperidone 6 mg/day in short-term treatment of
      schizophrenia and more effective than haloperidol 7-10 mg/day in maintenance of
      response in chronic schizophrenia. Aripiprazole appears to be well tolerated,
      with most studies suggesting a frequency of adverse effects similar to placebo.
      Aripiprazole seems not to cause significant EPSE, hyperprolactinaemia, excessive 
      weight gain or cardiac rhythm disturbance. Limited data suggest that aripiprazole
      is not associated with impaired glucose tolerance.

TI  - The effects of atypical antipsychotics on serum prolactin levels.
PG  - 163-73
AB  - Hyperprolactinemia may be a concern in the treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia. The side effects associated with high prolactin levels can have a 
      negative impact on patient compliance with treatment. Atypical antipsychotics as 
      a group cause less hyperprolactinemia than conventional antipsychotics, yet there
      is considerable variation among specific drugs. Risperidone at higher doses has
      been shown to produce increases in prolactin similar to conventional
      antipsychotics. At the other end of the spectrum, clozapine and quetiapine
      produce minimal sustained increases in prolactin that are no different from
      placebo. However, correlations between prolactin elevations and clinical symptoms
      have not been well-established. This paper reviews the published literature
      regarding prolactin levels in treated and untreated patients with schizophrenia
      and the relationship of prolactin and dopamine. It concludes with an overview of 
      the effects of specific atypical antipsychotics on prolactin levels in patients
      with schizophrenia.

TI  - Early intervention in schizophrenia: a critique.
PG  - 248-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Two forms of early intervention in psychosis are currently being
      proposed--intervention before the onset of illness with at-risk individuals and
      intervention after the onset of psychosis. METHOD: The risks and potential
      benefits associated with these two approaches were examined using published data 
      and Bayes probability theorem. RESULTS: Claims for benefits from early
      intervention in established psychosis go back more than two hundred years to the 
      nineteenth-century advocates for asylum construction. Theoretical support for
      early intervention in psychosis rests on data suggesting that a longer duration
      of untreated psychosis (DUP) is associated with poor outcome. The association of 
      DUP with outcome, however, appears to be inseparable from the confounding
      influence of the good outcome expected in recent-onset psychosis. Although some
      researchers advocate treating people with premorbid features of psychosis or
      other high-risk indicators, adequate screening measures and effective
      interventions are not yet available. The most promising current screening
      measure, if applied to the general population, would be accurate only two percent
      of the time. The accuracy of these measures can be improved by screening only
      those patients who are referred to a clinic, but this strategy will result in
      many cases in the population-at-large being overlooked. DISCUSSION: The risks and
      potential benefits associated with the two early intervention approaches are very
      different. The provision of optimal treatment early in psychosis could produce
      benefits, but people with brief, good-prognosis psychotic episodes are likely to 
      receive unnecessary treatment. Screening the general population or patients
      referred to a clinic will have little public health impact on the incidence of
      schizophrenia. There is likely to be considerable negative impact on those who
      are inaccurately labeled as being at imminent risk of psychosis and are treated
      accordingly.

      analysis and open prospective study on its efficacy and safety versus combined
      treatment with amitriptyline and haloperidol.
PG  - 31-5
AB  - Although atypical antipsychotics are on the rise, traditional treatment of
      psychotic (or delusional) depression mostly includes the addition of classical
      antipsychotics to antidepressants. As there are only few data supporting this
      approach compared with antidepressant monotherapy, and almost no data comparing
      it with antidepressants of the latest generation, we conducted a retrospective
      chart analysis and a prospective, randomized open study on the efficacy and
      tolerability of nefazodone monotherapy versus combined treatment with
      amitriptyline and haloperidol in psychotic depression. The results suggest that
      the addition of classical antipsychotics should be reserved for those with very
      severe psychotic symptoms, but may not be needed in milder forms.

TI  - Clozapine in Parkinson's disease psychosis: 5-year follow-up review.
PG  - 8-11
AB  - The objective of this study was to monitor the long-term effect of clozapine
      administered to Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with psychosis. Confusion,
      visual hallucinations, and psychosis are major dose-limiting factors for
      long-term dopaminergic management of PD. Classic neuroleptic agents exacerbate
      the motor symptoms of the disease. For this reason, the introduction of atypical 
      antipsychotic drugs has been a major advancement for the management of psychosis 
      in patients with PD. Of them, clozapine is one of the most effective. Thirty-two 
      patients (mean age, 73 years; mean disease duration, 12.2 years) with PD and
      psychosis (DSM-IV), 14 of them with dementia (DSM-IV), were followed for 5 years 
      with periodic clinical evaluation, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and
      Parkinsonian Psychosis Rating Scale (PPRS) administered before and following the 
      study (at least once in 6 months). Periodic blood count was performed for
      tracking neutropenia. Nineteen patients (8 with dementia) have continued to
      receive clozapine (mean daily dose, 50 mg). Thirteen patients stopped medication:
      9 because symptoms improved and did not return after weaning off clozapine; 3
      patients because of somnolence; and 1 because of personal reasons. The average
      duration of treatment in those in whom medication was stopped was 8.5 months
      (range, 1-24 months). No correlation was found between age, sex, duration, and
      severity of disease (Yahr scoring), the presence of dementia, and the response to
      clozapine. Also, the PPRS scoring did not influence clozapine response. No case
      of neutropenia was found. According to the experience accumulated and the results
      of the present study, the authors believe clozapine is the best therapeutic
      choice currently available for the management of psychosis in patients with PD.

TI  - Attenuation of olanzapine-induced weight gain with reboxetine in patients with
      schizophrenia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 297-302
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since increased norepinephrine availability may account for the
      weight-reducing effect of appetite suppressants, the authors hypothesized that
      the addition of the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor reboxetine may
      prevent or attenuate olanzapine-induced weight gain. METHOD: Twenty-six patients 
      hospitalized for first-episode DSM-IV schizophrenic disorder participated in the 
      study. In addition to 6 weeks of treatment with olanzapine, 10 mg/day, patients
      were randomly allocated in a double-blind design to receive either reboxetine, 4 
      mg/day, (N=13) or placebo (N=13). RESULTS: Ten patients in each group completed
      the 6-week trial. Patients given olanzapine and reboxetine demonstrated a
      significantly lower increase in body weight (mean=2.5 kg, SD=2.7) than those
      given olanzapine and placebo (mean=5.5 kg, SD=3.1). Significantly fewer patients 
      in the olanzapine/reboxetine group (N=2 of 10) than in the olanzapine/placebo
      group (N=7 of 10) gained at least 7% of their initial weight, the cutoff for
      clinically significant weight gain. The addition of reboxetine to olanzapine
      treatment was safe and well tolerated by the patients. A between-group difference
      in the reduction of Hamilton depression scale scores was seen that favored the
      olanzapine/reboxetine group (mean difference=-3.1, SD=1.25). CONCLUSIONS: The
      selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor reboxetine may reduce
      olanzapine-induced weight gain in schizophrenia patients, and activation of the
      adrenergic system may attenuate weight gain induced by atypical antipsychotic
      agents.

TI  - Changes in glucose and cholesterol levels in patients with schizophrenia treated 
      with typical or atypical antipsychotics.
PG  - 290-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The association of hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia with use of 
      atypical antipsychotics has been documented in case reports and uncontrolled
      studies. The authors' goal was to assess the effects of clozapine, olanzapine,
      risperidone, and haloperidol on glucose and cholesterol levels in hospitalized
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder during a randomized
      double-blind 14-week trial. METHOD: One hundred fifty-seven patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were inpatients at four hospitals
      were originally included in the study. The 14-week trial consisted of an 8-week
      fixed-dose period and a 6-week variable-dose period. Planned assessments included
      fasting glucose and cholesterol, which were collected at baseline and at the end 
      of the 8-week period and the following 6-week period. RESULTS: One hundred eight 
      of the 157 patients provided blood samples at baseline and at least at one point 
      after random assignment to clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol
      during the treatment trial. Seven of these patients had diabetes; their glucose
      levels were >125 mg/dl at baseline. Data from 101 patients were used for
      statistical analyses. During the initial 8-week period there was an overall
      significant increase in mean glucose levels. There were significant increases in 
      glucose levels at the end of the 8-week fixed-dose period for patients given
      clozapine (N=27) and those given haloperidol (N=25). The olanzapine group showed 
      a significant increase of glucose levels at the end of the 6-week variable-dose
      period (N=22). Fourteen of the 101 patients developed abnormal glucose levels
      (>125 mg/dl) during the trial (six with clozapine, four with olanzapine, three
      with risperidone, and one with haloperidol). Cholesterol levels were increased at
      the end of the 8-week fixed-dose period for the patients given clozapine (N=27)
      and those given olanzapine (N=26); cholesterol levels were also increased at the 
      end of the 6-week variable-dose period for patients given olanzapine (N=22).
      CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective randomized trial, clozapine, olanzapine, and
      haloperidol were associated with an increase of plasma glucose level, and
      clozapine and olanzapine were associated with an increase in cholesterol levels. 
      The mean changes in glucose and cholesterol levels remained within clinically
      normal ranges, but approximately 14% of the patients developed abnormally high
      glucose levels during the course of their participation in the study.

TI  - Impaired fasting glucose tolerance in first-episode, drug-naive patients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 284-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose
      tolerance in first-episode, drug-naive patients with schizophrenia. METHOD: In
      this cross-sectional study, fasting plasma levels of glucose, insulin, lipids,
      and cortisol were measured in 15 male and 11 female hospitalized Caucasian
      patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (mean age=33.6 years) and age- and sex-matched
      healthy comparison subjects. The patients and comparison subjects were also
      matched in terms of various life-style and anthropometric measures. RESULTS: More
      than 15% of the drug-naive, first-episode patients with schizophrenia had
      impaired fasting glucose tolerance, compared to none of the healthy volunteers.
      Compared with the healthy subjects, the patients with schizophrenia had
      significantly higher fasting plasma levels of glucose (mean=88.2 mg/dl, SD=5.4,
      for the healthy subjects versus mean=95.8 mg/dl, SD=16.9, for the patients),
      insulin (mean=7.7 micro u/ml, SD=3.7, versus mean=9.8 micro u/ml, SD=3.9), and
      cortisol (mean=303.2 nmol/liter, SD=10.5, versus mean=499.4 nmol/liter, SD=161.4)
      and were more insulin resistant, as measured with homeostasis model assessment
      (mean=1.7, SD=0.7, for the healthy subjects versus mean=2.3, SD=1.0, for the
      patients). CONCLUSIONS: First-episode, drug-naive patients with schizophrenia
      have impaired fasting glucose tolerance and are more insulin resistant and have
      higher levels of plasma glucose, insulin, and cortisol than healthy comparison
      subjects.

TI  - D1 receptor alleles predict PET metabolic correlates of clinical response to
      clozapine.
PG  - 109-13
AB  - A goal of pharmacogenetics is to clarify associations between allelic variation
      and risk factors in psychiatric illness. We report changes in regional brain
      metabolism based on dopamine alleles. Treatment-resistant schizophrenic subjects 
      were positron emission tomography scanned with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose after 5
      weeks each of placebo and clozapine treatment. Significant regional brain
      metabolic effects were found for the D1 receptor genotypes (P < 0.05), adjusted
      for multiple comparisons. Metabolic decreases for the 2,2 genotype but not the
      1,2 genotype were observed in all major sectors of the brain, with the exception 
      of the ventral parts of the caudate and putamen. Frontal, temporal, parietal, and
      occipital neocortices showed decreased metabolism as did the cingulate
      juxta-allocortex and the parahippocampal allocortex. Decreases were also observed
      in the thalamus, amygdala, and cerebellum bilaterally. No significant metabolic
      differences by genotype were observed for D3, 5HT(2A), and 5HT(2C) polymorphisms.
      In terms of clinical response, the DRD1 2,2 genotype significantly improved with 
      clozapine treatment, demonstrating a 30% decrease in the Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale positive symptoms in contrast to a 7% worsening for the 1,2 genotype (P <
      0.05). In this preliminary study, brain metabolic and clinical response to
      clozapine are related to the D1 receptor genotype.

TI  - Clozapine pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents with childhood-onset
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 87-91
AB  - Clozapine (CLZ) dose-related adverse effects may be more common in children than 
      adults, perhaps reflecting developmental pharmacokinetic (PK) differences.
      However, no pediatric CLZ PK data are available. Accordingly, we studied CLZ and 
      its metabolites, norclozapine (NOR), and clozapine-N-oxide (NOX) in six youth,
      ages 9-16 years, with childhood onset schizophrenia (COS). At the time of the PK 
      study, mean CLZ dose was 200 mg (3.4 mg/kg). Serum was collected during week 6 on
      CLZ before and 0.5-8 h after a morning dose. Serum concentrations were assayed by
      liquid chromatography/UV-detection. Mean concentration, area-under-the-curve
      (AUC), and clearance were calculated. CLZ clearance averaged 1.7 L/kg-h. NOR
      concentrations (410) exceeded CLZ (289) and NOX (63 ng/ml) and AUC(0-8h) of NOR
      (3,356) > CLZ (2,359) > NOX (559 ng/ml-h) [53, 38, and 9% of total analytes,
      respectively]. In adults, NOR serum concentrations on average are 10-25% < CLZ,
      differing significantly from our sample. Dose normalized concentrations of CLZ
      (mg/kg-d) did not vary with age and were similar to reported adult values.
      Clinical improvement seen in 5/6 patients correlated with serum CLZ
      concentrations. In addition, clinical response and total number of side effects
      correlated with NOR concentrations. NOR (a neuropharmacologically active
      metabolite) and free CLZ may contribute to the effectiveness and adverse effects 
      in youth.

TI  - A prospective trial of bupropion SR augmentation of partial and non-responders to
      serotonergic antidepressants.
PG  - 27-30
AB  - Many patients fail to achieve an adequate response to a given antidepressant
      trial. The best-studied augmentation agents, lithium and thyroid supplementation 
      are less commonly used. Augmenting antidepressants with bupropion has become an
      increasingly common strategy in the treatment of resistant depression. Several
      case reports and 2 open label studies suggest efficacy of this strategy. The
      purpose of this study is to further examine the utility of bupropion sustained
      release (SR) augmentation in patients with inadequate response to selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients who met DSM-IV criteria for major
      depression and had failed to achieve adequate response to an SSRI were considered
      for this study. Eligible patients were required to have a score of 16 on the
      24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Patients were treated openly for
      6 weeks with bupropion SR added to their existing antidepressant. The dose range 
      of bupropion was 150 to 300 mg per day. At each visit, patients were assessed
      using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Depression Ratings Scale 
      (HDRS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Twenty-eight patients (12 men, 
      16 women) entered the study. Twenty-five patients completed the six-week trial.
      With respect to the clinical benefit of bupropion SR augmentation, 15 out of 28, 
      or 54% of patients, were classified as responders, showing a decrease in their
      HDRS or BDI scores of 50% or more between baseline and Week 6. This prospective, 
      open-label trial supports the use of bupropion SR in the augmentation of SSRIs
      and venlafaxine. Placebo controlled trials should be completed to further
      evaluate the efficacy of this strategy.

TI  - Quetiapine treatment in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder: an open
      trial of adjunctive therapy.
PG  - 15-20
AB  - In this 6-week, open-label trial, combat veterans meeting DSM-IV criteria for
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were treated with the atypical antipsychotic
      quetiapine. The starting dose was 25 mg at bedtime with subsequent titration
      based on tolerability and clinical response. Primary outcome was measured using
      the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Secondary assessments of efficacy
      included the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), the Hamilton Rating
      Scale for Depression, and the Clinical Global Impression Scale. Safety and
      tolerability evaluations included neurologic ratings, vital signs, and assessment
      of treatment-emergent side effects. Eighteen of 20 patients enrolled in the study
      completed 6 weeks of open-label treatment. The dose range of quetiapine was 25 to
      300 mg daily, with an average of 100+/-70 mg/d. There was significant improvement
      in CAPS scores, from 89.8+/-15.7 to 67.5+/-21.0 (t=4.863, df=18, <0.005), and
      composite PANSS ratings from baseline to endpoint. General psychopathology
      (PANSS) and depressive symptoms (HRSD) were also reduced at the 6-week end point.
      There were no serious adverse events and no clinically significant changes in
      vital signs or neurologic ratings. This preliminary open trial suggests that
      quetiapine is well tolerated and may have efficacy in reducing PTSD symptoms in
      patients who have not had an adequate response other medications. Studies
      utilizing a randomized, controlled trial design and larger sample sizes are
      needed to better define the potential role of quetiapine and other atypical
      antipsychotics in the treatment of PTSD.

TI  - Cognition enhancing or neuroprotective compounds for the treatment of cognitive
      disorders: why? when? which?
PG  - 119-28
AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy-Body dementia,
      Parkinson's disease and cerebrovascular dementia result in an insidious cognitive
      and behavioural decline culminating in the development of severe dementia. Based 
      on current population projections it has been estimated that by 2050 the number
      of individuals over 65 will increase to 1.1 billion worldwide and as a
      consequence, the number of cases of dementia to 37 million. Faced with such an
      enormous public health and socio-economic burden it is evident that the
      importance of therapeutic intervention aimed at either finding a cure or
      preventing disease progression cannot be overstated. The aim of the present paper
      is to present an overview, in the context of a brain aging continuum, at what
      stage cognition enhancing and/or neuroprotective intervention strategies aimed at
      stabilising and/or preventing neurodegenerative disease could demonstrate
      potential clinical benefit. In particular, the clinical identification of
      patients with mild cognitive impairment and age-associated memory impairment
      which may represent a 'transition' state between normal aging and dementia is
      discussed as a potential clinical population cohort targeted for early
      intervention in dementia. Considering the wide spectrum of cognitive and
      psychotic effects in dementia juxtaposed with the neuropathological evolution of 
      the disease, it is clear that a variety of therapeutic intervention(s) will be
      required in order, to at the least, stabilise disease progression. Evidently,
      since Alzheimer's disease is by far the most prevalent form of dementia, and will
      undoubtedly serve as the benchmark for any future treatment of dementia, an
      update of current symptomatic and disease-modifying therapeutic approaches
      (cholinergic, glutamatergic, nootropics, beta-amyloid cascade inhibitors) will be
      reviewed.

TI  - [Schizoaffective disorder: clinical symptoms and present-day approach to
      treatment].
PG  - 1057-65
AB  - During 20th century serious mental disorders were divided into two groups
      according symptomatology and course of disorder. Individuals with dominating
      disturbance of perception, thinking and cognition were basically diagnosed having
      schizophrenic. Individuals with mood disturbance were basically diagnosed having 
      affective disorders. However, there were patients who did not fit neatly into
      either category. In 1933 Jocob Kasanin introduced the term "schizoaffective
      psychosis". Scientific discussions involved the possibility that schizoaffective 
      disorder was conceptualized most accurately as following: a type of
      schizophrenia, a type of affective disorder, a unique disorder that was separate 
      from both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an arbitrary categorization of
      clinical symptoms that marked a continuum between schizophrenia and affective
      illness, a heterogeneous collection of "interforms" between schizophrenia and
      affective disorders. However, diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is included
      both in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10. Schizoaffective disorder is listed in the category 
      "schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders". The differential diagnosis
      includes basically either schizophrenia or affective disorder. The
      epidemiological status of schizoaffective disorder is somewhat uncertain compared
      with schizophrenia because of dilemmas related to diagnosis and classification of
      the disorder. Treatment of schizoaffective disorder comprises psychotropic
      medication, supportive psychotherapy, social care, rehabilitation. The most
      important groups of psychotropic medications are: antipsychotics, antidepressants
      and mood stabilizers. Atypical antipsychotics are the first-line medication for
      schizoaffective disorder due to their pharmacological properties. In the case of 
      schizoaffective disorders combination of atypical antipsychotics with
      antidepressants seems to be useful. Novel antidepressants have priority for the
      combination mentioned above. Peculiarities of mechanism of action of
      antidepressant are important for combinations. Mood stabilizers seem to be useful
      for treatment of certain type of schizoaffective disorder as well.

TI  - Risperidone in the treatment of Hispanic inpatients with schizophrenia: a pilot
      study.
PG  - 371-4
AB  - A growing body of scientific evidence over the last two decades suggests that
      certain ethnic groups may require lower dosages of standard antipsychotics for
      the treatment of schizophrenia symptoms. Recent studies have implicated the role 
      of genetic and environmental factors in the metabolism of these drugs as the
      basis for this differential response. In this pilot study, 10 Hispanic and 8
      non-Hispanic patients with schizophrenia were enrolled in a double-blind,
      parallel-group, inpatient risperidone dosing (daily versus twice daily) trial
      with the novel antipsychotic risperidone. The result of repeated measures ANOVA
      reveals a significant interaction effect for race, indicative of a faster rate of
      symptom improvement (PANSS General) in Hispanic patients. The findings suggest
      that this novel agent may be preferable for certain ethnic groups. A trend toward
      more frequently occurring extrapyramidal symptoms among Hispanics was also found,
      which suggests that dosages lower than those typically recommended may be
      necessary in Hispanic schizophrenics.

TI  - An open study of olanzapine and fluoxetine for psychotic major depressive
      disorder: interim analyses.
PG  - 1164-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although atypical antipsychotic agents are commonly used in the
      treatment of psychotic depression, there are no published prospective studies on 
      their use in this condition. The aim of this study was to assess, by interim
      analyses, the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic agent olanzapine in
      combination with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant agent 
      fluoxetine. METHOD: We enrolled 27 patients (17 women [63.0%] and 10 men [37.0%];
      mean +/- SD age: 41.2 +/- 14.7 years) with DSM-IV-defined major depressive
      disorder with psychotic features into an open trial of olanzapine, 5 to 20
      mg/day, plus fluoxetine, 20 to 80 mg/day. Patients were assessed at each visit
      with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and both the psychotic and 
      mood modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders,
      Patient Edition. We are reporting the results of the first 6 weeks of treatment. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-two (81.5%) of the 27 enrolled patients completed the 6-week open
      trial, and 5 (18.5%) dropped out, with only 2 (7.4%) dropping out due to side
      effects. Of the 27 patients, 74.1% (N = 20) met criteria for melancholic
      features, 14.8% (N = 4) had delusions alone, 18.5% (N = 5) had hallucinations
      alone, and 66.7% (N = 18) reported both delusions and hallucinations. In
      addition, the overall rates of response for the intent-to-treat group were as
      follows: depression response rate, 66.7% (N = 18); psychosis response rate, 59.3%
      (N = 16); psychotic depression response rate, 55.6% (N = 15); and psychotic
      depression remission rate, 40.7% (N = 11). CONCLUSION: The combination of
      olanzapine and fluoxetine appears to be a promising, safe, and effective
      treatment for psychotic depression. Double-blind studies are needed to confirm
      this impression.

TI  - Quetiapine in bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence.
PG  - 406-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bipolar disorder is associated with the highest rates of substance
      abuse of any psychiatric illness. Therefore, treatments that stabilize mood and
      decrease drug use or cravings are of great interest. Atypical antipsychotics are 
      in widespread use in patients with bipolar disorder. However, minimal data are
      available on their use in bipolar patients with comorbid substance abuse.
      METHODS: Open-label, add-on, quetiapine therapy was examined for 12 weeks in 17
      outpatients with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence. Subjects were evaluated
      with a structured clinical interview; Hamilton Depression Rating (HDRS), Young
      Mania Rating (YMRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating (BPRS) scales; and Cocaine Craving 
      Questionnaire (CCQ). Urine samples and self-reported drug use were also obtained.
      Data were analyzed using a last observation carried forward method on all
      subjects given medication at baseline. RESULTS: Significant improvement from
      baseline to exit was observed in HDRS, YMRS, BPRS and CCQ scores (p < or = 0.05).
      Dollars spent on cocaine and days/week of cocaine use decreased
      non-significantly, and urine drug screens did not change significantly from
      baseline to exit. Quetiapine was well tolerated, with no subjects to our
      knowledge discontinuing because of side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: The use of
      quetiapine was associated with substantial improvement in psychiatric symptoms
      and cocaine cravings. The findings are promising and suggest larger controlled
      trials of quetiapine are needed in this population.

TI  - Prescribing second-generation antipsychotics and the evolving standard of care in
      Italy.
PG  - 239-43
AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate the routine use of
      second-generation antipsychotic drugs in the Italian psychiatric care system.
      Seven outpatient psychiatric services enrolled a consecutive case series of
      patients who were being treated, or had started treatment, with clozapine,
      olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine. Information on sociodemographic and
      clinical variables, current psychotropic drug use, side-effects and past use of
      typical drugs was collected. In addition, patient symptoms and functional status 
      were evaluated by the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale. Patients receiving
      off-label prescribing of second-generation antipsychotics were identified. A
      total of 209 patients were collected. In comparison with patients receiving other
      second-generation antipsychotics, living in residential facilities, unemployment,
      long psychiatric histories, and problems with activities of daily living and
      living conditions were more common in clozapine-treated patients. Nearly 80 % of 
      patients receiving clozapine had schizophrenia compared to less than 50 % of
      those receiving other second-generation antipsychotics. Overall, 109 patients (52
      %) received off-label prescriptions of second-generation antipsychotic drugs.
      This survey indicates that clozapine was mostly reserved for severe cases and
      poor responders; the high rate of off-label prescriptions highlights the gap
      existing between recommendations derived from randomised clinical trials and the 
      current use of drugs.

TI  - Neuroreceptor imaging in psychiatric disorders.
PG  - 437-46
AB  - Molecular imaging, the study of receptors, transporters and enzymes, as well as
      other cellular processes, has grown in recent years to be one of the most active 
      neuroimaging areas. The application of single photon emission tomography (SPECT) 
      and positron emission tomography (PET) techniques to the study of psychiatric
      illness has lead to increased understanding of disease processes as well as
      validated, in vivo, theories of illness etiology. Within the field of psychiatry 
      these techniques have been applied most widely to the study of schizophrenia.
      Studies within schizophrenia are largely limited to either the dopamine or
      serotonin system. This is due in large part to the availability of suitable
      radiotracers as well as the current theories on the etiology of the illness. Two 
      basic study designs are used when studying schizophrenia using molecular imaging 
      and make up the majority of studies reviewed in this manuscript. The first type, 
      termed "clinical studies," compares the findings from PET and SPECT studies in
      those with schizophrenia to normal controls in an attempt to understand the
      pathophysiology of the illness. The second study design, termed "occupancy
      studies," uses these techniques to enhance the understanding of the mechanism of 
      action of the medications used in treating this illness. This review will focus
      on the findings of molecular imaging studies in schizophrenia, focusing, for the 
      most part, on the serotonin and dopamine systems. Emphasis will be placed on how 
      these findings and techniques are currently being used to inform the development 
      of novel treatments for schizophrenia.

TI  - Redefining mood stabilization.
PG  - 163-9
AB  - This review considers the definition of the term 'mood-stabilizer' in the context
      of new pharmacological agents for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Three
      definitions of a mood-stabilizer are described and the available data from
      randomized, double-blind, controlled trials for putative mood-stabilizers studied
      in the treatment of different aspects of bipolar disorder (mania, mixed states,
      depression, maintenance) are reviewed. No available agent meets the criteria for 
      a comprehensive mood-stabilizer, although lithium comes the closest.

TI  - Placebo-controlled trials do not find association of olanzapine with exacerbation
      of bipolar mania.
PG  - 147-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Published case reports describe apparent induction or exacerbation of
      manic-like symptoms during treatment with the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine 
      and risperidone. To date, such reports are from uncontrolled clinical experience 
      and therefore cannot clarify whether the atypical antipsychotics caused such
      manic-like states or simply failed to prevent them. Presumably, bipolar patients 
      would be at increased risk for this putative adverse event. Therefore, we
      evaluated the potential of olanzapine to exacerbate symptoms of mania compared to
      placebo during treatment of bipolar mania. METHODS: Two inpatient, double-blind, 
      randomized trials investigating the efficacy of olanzapine 5-20 mg daily versus
      placebo for the treatment of acute mania were combined. Two hundred and
      fifty-four subjects participated (placebo n=129; olanzapine n=125) in the two
      studies. Severity of mania was quantified with the 11-item Young-Mania Rating
      Scale (Y-MRS). In a post-hoc analysis, after double-blind therapy up to 3 weeks, 
      categorical comparison of olanzapine and placebo groups was made for any
      worsening and worsening by 10 or 20% from baseline Y-MRS scores (LOCF). RESULTS: 
      The percentage of subjects with exacerbation at endpoint were: any worsening,
      placebo 37.7%, olanzapine 21.8% (P=0.005); >or=10% worsening, placebo 24.6%,
      olanzapine 14.5% (P=0.039); >or=20% worsening, placebo 15.6%, olanzapine 8.1%
      (P=0.064). CONCLUSION: Mania rating scores worsened for some patients during
      olanzapine therapy. However, this was significantly less common with olanzapine
      than with placebo. These controlled data suggest that clinical case reports of
      occurrence of 'mania' during treatment with olanzapine, and possibly those with
      other atypical antipsychotics, reflect exacerbation in the natural history of
      bipolar illness, rather than an adverse pharmacological effect. LIMITATIONS:
      Post-hoc analysis of pooled data from two different studies.

TI  - Duration and stability of the rapid-cycling course: a long-term personal
      follow-up of 109 patients.
PG  - 75-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recognition by the DSM-IV of rapid cyclicity as a course specifier
      has raised the question of the stability and long-term outcome of rapid-cycling
      (RC) patients. Data on this topic is sparse and often inconsistent. To our
      knowledge, these are the first personally followed patients over the long term,
      dealing directly with the issue of the duration of the RC course. METHODS: We
      examined the evolution of the course of 109 RC patients (68 women and 41 men)
      followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 36 years, beginning with the index
      episode when the RC course was diagnosed by the authors (A.K., G.P.M., P.G.,
      L.P., D.R.). Patients were included in the study if they met criteria for RC as
      defined by>or=4 affective episodes per year (Dunner and Fieve, 1974). The
      follow-up period varied from 2-5 years for 25 patients, 6-10 years for 24
      patients, 11-15 years for 24 patients, 16-20 years for 19 patients, 21-25 years
      for 13 patients, 30-36 years for four patients. RESULTS: In 13 patients (12%), RC
      emerged spontaneously and in 96 patients (88%), it was associated with
      antidepressant and other treatments. In 19 women (28% of all women) RC course
      started in perimenopausal age (45-54 years). The mean duration of RC during the
      follow-up period was 7.86 years (range 1-32) and its total duration (including RC
      course prior to the follow-up period) was 11 years (range 1-40). The total
      duration of the affective disorder, from the first episode to the end of the
      follow-up, was 21.78 years (range 1-70). At the end of the follow-up, 36 patients
      (33%) had complete remission for at least the past year, 44 (40%) stayed rapid
      cycling with severe episodes (six of this group committed suicide), while 15
      (14%) were rapid cycling but with attenuated episodes. The other 14 patients
      (13%) became long cyclers, eight with severe episodes and six with milder ones.
      The main distinguishing features between those who remitted from and those who
      persisted in the RC course were: (1). the initial cycle pattern: patients with
      Depression-Hypomania(mania)-Free interval cycles (53 patients) had a worse
      outcome: 26.4% remitted and 52.8% persisted in the RC course through to the end
      of the follow up period. The Mania/Hypomania-Depression-Free interval cycles (22 
      patients) had a significantly better outcome, with 50% remitted and 27.2%
      persisting RC; and (2). the occurrence of the switch process from depression to
      hypomania/mania and the occurrence of agitated depressions made the prognosis
      worse. Continuous treatment was more effective against mania/hypomania than
      against depression, yet in all persisting RC cases the mania/hypomania remitted
      only partially. LIMITATIONS: These data derive from clinics known for their
      expertise in mood disorders, and they may have attracted and retained patients
      with a more severe course. Treatment was uncontrolled and consisted more of
      lithium than divalproex, lamotrigene and olanzapine, recently shown to be
      beneficial in subgroups of patients with rapid-cycling. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
      suggest that rapid cyclicity, spontaneous or induced, once established, becomes
      for many years a stable rhythm in a substantial proportion of patients, linked to
      endogenous and environmental factors. The suggestion is made to consider as
      rapid-cyclers, at least for research purposes, those patients who have had a
      rapid cycling course for at least 2 years, borrowing the duration criterion
      currently employed for other chronic disorders such as Dysthymia and Cyclothymia.
      That our patients had poorer prognosis than some other cohorts in the literature 
      is probably due to the shorter duration of "rapid-cycling" at entry in the latter
      cohorts. A true understanding of the nature of rapid-cycling will require a
      rigorous definition of not only duration, but also pole-switching and course
      patterns at entry into study.

TI  - A cost-effectiveness clinical decision analysis model for treatment of
      Schizophrenia.
PG  - 572-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia afflicts approximately 0.7% of Mexican citizens during 
      their lifetime. This study explored whether the difference in clinical efficacy
      and safety between atypical antipsychotics and conventional neuroleptics results 
      in decreases in use and cost of medical services in Mexico, offsetting the higher
      price of atypical antipsychotics. METHODS: A U.S. decision analytic Markov model 
      was adapted for use in Mexico to determine cost-effectiveness of treatments and
      outcomes that Mexican patients with schizophrenia may experience over a 5-year
      period when treated with olanzapine, haloperidol, or risperidone. Model parameter
      estimates were based on clinical trial data, published medical literature, and
      where needed, clinician judgment. Direct medical costs were incorporated into the
      model and outcomes were estimated using lack of relapse and clinical outcomes
      based on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) as effectiveness indicators.
      All costs are reported in Mexican pesos. RESULTS: Over a 5-year period, the cost 
      of treating schizophrenia ranged from 196,620 pesos per patient initiating
      therapy with haloperidol to 226,670 pesos per patient beginning therapy with
      risperidone. Olanzapine was estimated to have slightly better non-relapse and
      BPRS-based effectiveness outcomes, but comparative total medical costs compared
      to risperidone. Patients receiving olanzapine experienced 13 and 2% fewer
      relapses compared with patients on haloperidol and risperidone, respectively. The
      5-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of olanzapine compared with
      haloperidol was 52,740 pesos per improved patient, BPRS-based outcome and 212,540
      pesos per avoided relapse. Sensitivity analyses indicated the model was sensitive
      only to changes in drug costs. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with haloperidol, olanzapine
      therapy results in improved symptoms, fewer relapses, and is cost-effective, even
      with conservative values for key model parameters. Olanzapine results in slightly
      improved patient outcomes and comparable costs compared with risperidone.

TI  - Efficacy of newer generation antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 9-26
AB  - The advent of the newer 'atypical' antipsychotic medications has revolutionized
      the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. In
      contrast to the older conventional antipsychotic agents, atypical medications
      have a broader spectrum of efficacy (greater efficacy in negative, cognitive, and
      mood symptoms) and a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive
      dyskinesia. Due to concerns surrounding hematological safety and other adverse
      effects, clozapine is used principally in patients refractory to treatment with
      other antipsychotic agents. The other three universally available atypical agents
      (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) collectively constitute about 70% of
      all antipsychotic prescriptions in the USA. Despite the broad popularity of these
      medications and their rapid adoption in general clinical practice, there are
      limited data on how they compare to each other with regards to their overall
      efficacy and also as to their efficacy in specific symptom domains. To address
      this question, two separate analyses were undertaken. First, all published,
      short-term, randomized, controlled clinical trials of these agents in
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were reviewed and the extent of
      improvement across these agents was compared. While the amount of improvement
      with a particular agent across its different studies varied, the average
      improvement was similar for the agents for all efficacy parameters considered.
      Secondly, all randomized, controlled clinical trials directly comparing two or
      more of these agents in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
      were analyzed. Only three such trials (all industry sponsored) were identified;
      while there were differences in methodology and small differences in efficacy on 
      a minority of measures on which comparisons were undertaken, the preponderance of
      data suggested no differences in efficacy. While data thus far do not support
      assertions of differential efficacy between risperidone, olanzapine, and
      quetiapine, there are clear differences in their side-effect profiles and these
      are briefly summarized.

TI  - Efficacy of olanzapine in social anxiety disorder: a pilot study.
PG  - 365-8
AB  - Based on evidence suggesting anxiolytic properties of the atypical antipsychotic 
      olanzapine, this study was conducted to evaluate whether olanzapine may be
      efficacious in treating social anxiety disorder (SAD). This study was an 8-week, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of olanzapine as monotherapy in which
      12 patients with the DSM-IV diagnosis of SAD were randomized to either olanzapine
      (n = 7) or placebo (n = 5). An initial dose of 5 mg/day was titrated to a maximum
      of 20 mg/day. Baseline to endpoint scores from the Brief Social Phobia Scale
      (BSPS), Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and
      Sheehan Disability Scale, as well as Clinical Global Impression-Improvement
      ratings, were compared for olanzapine versus placebo. Seven subjects completed
      all 8 weeks of the study, four in the olanzapine group and three in the placebo
      group. In the intent-to-treat analysis, olanzapine yielded greater improvement
      than placebo on the primary measures: BSPS (p = 0.02) and SPIN (p = 0.01). Both
      treatments were well tolerated, although the olanzapine group had more drowsiness
      and dry mouth. Olanzapine and placebo were both associated with negligible weight
      gain. Olanzapine was superior to placebo on the primary outcome measures in this 
      preliminary study of SAD. Additional studies of olanzapine as a treatment for SAD
      are warranted.

TI  - The potential cardiotoxicity of antipsychotic drugs as assessed by heart rate
      variability.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - Most antipsychotic drugs have cardiac effects as a consequence of their
      pharmacological actions. Recently, thioridazine has been subjected to a
      restricted indications notice and sertindole had its license withdrawn because of
      concerns about their potential cardiotoxicity. In the development of new atypical
      agents, heart-rate corrected QT effects are evaluated but it is unclear how
      predictive these are of clinically significant cardiotoxicity or sudden death.
      Heart rate variability (HRV) is a potential index of cardiotoxicity which has
      been found to be decreased following antidepressants and clozapine. We studied
      acute HRV changes following antipsychotic agents. Sixteen healthy male volunteers
      received risperidone (4 mg), olanzapine (10 mg), thioridazine (50 mg) or placebo 
      in a randomized cross-over design. Subjective effects and psychomotor function
      were assayed at 2 h and both linear (summary statistics) and non-linear
      (scatterplot) measures of HRV were evaluated by continuous electrocardiogram
      recording over 10 h. Differential effects of single doses of the three
      antipsychotic drugs on HRV were found, and these were independent of their
      sedative effects. Olanzapine increased, and thioridazine decreased HRV, while
      risperidone had no effect. HRV is sensitive to the acute effects of
      antipsychotics. It may prove to be a reliable index of their potential for
      cardiotoxicity. Further studies in both healthy volunteers and patients on
      antipsychotic medication will be valuable.

TI  - Effect of divalproex combined with olanzapine or risperidone in patients with an 
      acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.
PG  - 182-92
AB  - This double-blind, randomized, multicenter study investigated the use of
      divalproex with an antipsychotic agent in patients hospitalized for acute
      exacerbation of schizophrenia. Patients (n = 249) who met DSM-IV criteria for
      schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine monotherapy,
      risperidone monotherapy, divalproex plus olanzapine, or divalproex plus
      risperidone for 28 days. Divalproex was initiated at 15 mg/kg/day and titrated
      over 12 days to a maximum dosage of 30 mg/kg/day. Olanzapine and risperidone,
      were, respectively, initiated at 5 and 2 mg/day and were titrated over the first 
      6 days to respective target fixed daily dosages of 15 and 6 mg/day. Improvements 
      from baseline were observed at all evaluation points throughout the 28-day
      treatment period in the two combination therapy and the two antipsychotic
      monotherapy groups, with statistically significant treatment differences favoring
      combination therapy as soon as day 3 for Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS) total score, derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRSd) total score, 
      as well as PANSS and BPRSd subscales. These findings were confirmed in post hoc
      repeated-measures analyses of variance in which treatment differences favoring
      combination therapy were observed for PANSS total (p = 0.020) and PANSS positive 
      scale scores (p = 0.002). Both combination therapy and antipsychotic monotherapy 
      were well tolerated. Treatment with divalproex in combination with an atypical
      antipsychotic agent resulted in earlier improvements in a range of psychotic
      symptoms among acutely hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Further
      evaluation is warranted to confirm these findings.

TI  - Moderators of placebo response to antipsychotic treatment in patients with
      schizophrenia: a meta-regression.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - RATIONALE: Variation in placebo response within and among clinical trials
      involving patients with schizophrenia can substantially affect conclusions about 
      the efficacy of new antipsychotic medications. Therefore, it is of great
      importance to identify factors that moderate response to placebo in such trials. 
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-regression analysis was to estimate the
      effect of potential moderators of placebo response in randomized, short-term
      clinical trials involving patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder
      or schizophreniform disorder. METHODS: Mean placebo response and potential
      moderators were extracted from 35 placebo-controlled, randomized trials of
      antipsychotic medications in patients with schizophrenia. Placebo response was
      defined as the absolute change in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score.
      Fixed-effects meta-regression was used to investigate between-trial variation in 
      placebo response. RESULTS: Trial duration accounted for a substantial proportion 
      of the between-trial variation in response (27%), with greater improvement on
      placebo observed in shorter trials. Other variables showed insufficient variation
      across trials to permit any inferences regarding their relationships with placebo
      response. CONCLUSIONS: Placebo-controlled trials of short duration (<6-8 weeks)
      are vulnerable to substantial placebo response. Recruiting patients with more
      severe pathology to mitigate placebo response does not appear to offer benefits
      and may even be counterproductive. Meta-analyses based on individual patient data
      offer the potential for much more detailed and inferentially sound exploration of
      factors affecting placebo response and are highly recommended.

TI  - Extrapyramidal symptom profiles assessed with the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal
      Symptom Scale: comparison with Western scales in the clinical double-blind
      studies of schizophrenic patients treated with either olanzapine or haloperidol.
PG  - 39-48
AB  - The superiority of olanzapine to haloperidol with respect to a decreased
      incidence of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS) in patients with
      schizophrenia was demonstrated in studies conducted in both Japan and Western
      countries. EPS measurements used in Western countries included the Simpson-Angus,
      Barnes akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, while the
      Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale (DIEPSS) was used in Japan. The aim of 
      this study was to clarify how the DIEPSS captures EPS profiles. The baseline
      prevalence and treatment-emergent incidence of EPS in Japanese schizophrenic
      patients treated with olanzapine or haloperidol were retrospectively compared as 
      assessed by the DIEPSS to the prevalence and incidence of EPS in primarily
      Caucasian schizophrenic patients who were treated with olanzapine or haloperidol.
      Specifically, the prevalence and incidence of dyskinesia, akathisia and
      parkinsonism were compared between the Japanese trial and an international trial 
      to examine if appropriate definitions using the DIEPSS can be derived assuming
      that a comparable prevalence and incidence of the syndromes would be observed
      when any differences in residual antipsychotic exposure at the initiation of
      study treatment were accounted for. For the incidence of all EPS syndromes, odds 
      ratios were observed to be similar between the two studies, indicating that
      appropriate criteria for the clinical diagnosis of the EPS syndromes could be
      established based on the DIEPSS. This preliminary and retrospective work suggests
      that the DIEPSS can be used to operationally define the presence or absence, and 
      make the clinical diagnosis, of specific EPS syndromes.

TI  - Adjunctive risperidone treatment in post-traumatic stress disorder: a preliminary
      controlled trial of effects on comorbid psychotic symptoms.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Positive and negative symptoms of psychosis may be common in patients with
      chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but few studies have investigated 
      the use of antipsychotic agents in these patients. This preliminary study
      examined the potential efficacy of risperidone in treating psychotic symptoms
      associated with chronic PTSD. In a 5-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial, adjunctive risperidone treatment was assessed in 40
      combat veterans with chronic PTSD and comorbid psychotic features. Most patients 
      were receiving antidepressants and some other psychotics with doses of concurrent
      medications held constant for at least 1 month prior to and during the study.
      Thirty-seven patients completed at least 1 week of treatment with risperidone or 
      placebo. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinician
      Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) were used to assess symptoms. The PANSS was the
      primary outcome measure. At treatment endpoint, risperidone-treated patients
      showed a significantly greater decrease from baseline, albeit modest, in
      psychotic symptoms (PANSS total scores) than placebo-treated patients (P < 0.05).
      CAPS ratings declined significantly in both groups but did not differ
      significantly between groups. However, CAPS re-experiencing subscale scores had
      greater improvement in the risperidone-treated patients at week 5 (P < 0.05,
      completer analysis) with a trend towards greater improvement versus placebo a
      endpoint (P < 0.1, LOCF). Risperidone was well tolerated with minimal
      extrapyramidal symptoms. These preliminary results support studying the potential
      efficacy of risperidone for treating global psychotic symptoms associated with
      chronic PTSD with a suggestion that core re-experiencing symptoms may also be
      responsive. Further research using randomized, controlled trial designs in larger
      patient groups are needed to define more adequately the role of risperidone and
      other atypical agents in PTSD.

TI  - Quetiapine in the treatment of rapid cycling bipolar disorder.
PG  - 335-40
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This prospective open-label study assessed the impact of add-on
      quetiapine in the treatment of rapid cycling bipolar patients. METHODS: Fourteen 
      rapid cycling bipolar patients were treated with quetiapine, which was added to
      their ongoing medication regimen for 112 +/- 33 days. At the beginning of the
      study, five were manic, three were in a mixed state, three were depressed, two
      hypomanic and one was euthymic. Patients were assessed prospectively with a
      modified version of the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolars (CGI-BP),
      the Young Scale for mania (YMRS) and the Hamilton Scale for Depression (HDRS).
      RESULTS: A significant reduction of the following scale scores was observed: a
      1.8 point reduction for the general CGI-BP (p = 0.013), a -1.3 point for the
      mania subscale (p = 0.016), a -1.01 point for the YMRS (p = 0.025). Improvement
      in depressive symptoms was not significant, neither in the CGI-BP (-1 point, p = 
      0.074) nor in the HDRS (-5.2 points, p = NS). The most common side-effect was
      sedation (n = 6, 43%). Doses of quetiapine were significantly reduced by the end 
      of the study (443 +/- 235 mg/day versus 268 +/- 190 mg/day, p = 0.008) and they
      also differed according to the initial episode to be treated (720 +/- 84 mg/day
      for mania, and 183 +/- 29 mg/day for depression, p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS:
      Quetiapine could possibly be an effective treatment for rapid cycling bipolar
      patients. Adequate doses for acute episodes could significantly differ according 
      to the episode polarity and the length of treatment.

TI  - Olanzapine in diverse syndromal and subsyndromal exacerbations of bipolar
      disorders.
PG  - 328-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effects of olanzapine in diverse exacerbations of bipolar 
      disorders. METHODS: Twenty-five evaluable bipolar disorder [14 bipolar I (BPI),
      10 bipolar II (BPII) and one bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (BP NOS)]
      outpatients received open olanzapine (15 adjunctive, 10 monotherapy). Thirteen
      had elevated (11 syndromal, two subsyndromal) and 12 depressed (four syndromal,
      eight subsyndromal) mood symptoms of at least mild severity, with Clinical Global
      Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores of at least 3. Only one had psychotic
      symptoms. RESULTS: With open olanzapine (15 adjunctive, 10 monotherapy), overall 
      symptom severity (CGI-S) as well as mood elevation (Young Mania Rating Scale),
      depression (Hamilton and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scales), and anxiety
      (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), rapidly decreased (significantly by days 2-3).
      Patients with the greatest baseline severity (CGI-S) had the greatest
      improvement. Fifteen of 25 (60%) patients responded. Time to consistent response 
      was bimodal, with five early (by 0.5 +/- 0.3 weeks) and 10 late (by 7.0 +/- 1.9
      weeks) responders. Early compared with late responders had 51% lower final
      olanzapine doses. Olanzapine was generally well tolerated, with sedation and
      weight gain the most common adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine was
      effective in diverse exacerbations of bipolar disorders. The bimodal distribution
      of time to response and different final doses are consistent with differential
      mechanisms mediating early compared with late responses. Controlled studies are
      warranted to further explore these preliminary observations.

TI  - Gabapentin augmentation therapy in bipolar depression.
PG  - 296-301
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gabapentin (GBP) may be useful in bipolar disorders, including as
      adjunctive therapy for bipolar depression, although controlled studies suggest
      inefficacy as primary treatment for mania or treatment-resistant rapid cycling.
      METHODS: We performed a 12-week trial of open GBP (mean dose 1725 mg/day) added
      to stable doses of mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics in 22 (10 women,
      mean age 38.4 years) depressed (28-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) >
      18] bipolar (10 bipolar I, 12 bipolar II) disorder outpatients. Mean illness
      duration was 18.6 years, current depressive episode duration was 18.0 weeks.
      Prospective 28-item HDRS, Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Clinical Global
      Impression-Severity (CGI-S) ratings were obtained. RESULTS: Overall, HDRS ratings
      decreased 53% from 32.5 +/- 7.7 at baseline to 16.5 +/- 12.8 at week 12 (p <
      0.0001). Twelve of 22 (55%) patients had moderate to marked improvement (HDRS
      decrease = 50%) with HDRS decreasing 78% from 27.9 +/- 6.2 to 6.2 +/- 4.5 (p <
      0.0001). Eight of 22 (36%) patients remitted (HDRS > or = 8). In non-responders, 
      HDRS decreased from 38.0 +/- 5.4 to 28.9 +/- 6.7 (p = 0.005). Ten of 13 (77%)
      mild to moderately depressed (baseline HDRS > 18 and <35) patients responded,
      while only two of nine patients (22%) with severe depression (HDRS > or = 35)
      responded (p < 0.03). Both groups, however, had similar, statistically
      significant HDRS decreases. GBP was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Open adjunctive
      GBP was effective and well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate bipolar
      depression. This open pilot study must be viewed with caution, and randomized
      controlled studies are warranted.

TI  - The plasma levels of interleukin-12 in schizophrenia, major depression, and
      bipolar mania: effects of psychotropic drugs.
PG  - 1107-14
AB  - Interleukin-12 (IL-12) plays a key role in promoting T helper 1 (Th1) responses
      and subsequent cell-mediated immunity. Given the role of cytokines in the
      pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, the dysregulation of IL-12 in these
      illnesses would be expected. We measured the plasma levels of IL-12 in 102
      psychiatric patients (43 schizophrenia, 34 major depression and 25 bipolar
      disorder) and 85 normal controls. In addition, IL-12 levels of the patients were 
      measured after an 8-week treatment to assess whether the levels were affected by 
      medication. The IL-12 levels of the patient group with major depression were
      significantly higher than that of the control group, whereas no differences were 
      found among the other groups. IL-12 values of the three patient groups decreased 
      significantly after 8 weeks of treatment. These findings support the hypothesis
      that activation of the inflammatory response system and in particular of
      Th-1-like cells, is involved in the pathophysiology of major depression and that 
      repeated administration of antidepressive and antipsychotic drugs may suppress
      IL-12 plasma concentrations in psychiatric patients.

TI  - Aripiprazole: profile on efficacy and safety.
PG  - 1773-81
AB  - Aripiprazole (Abilitat, Bristol-Myers Squibb) is the most recent addition to the 
      new class of atypical antipsychotic medications, following the release of
      clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. Aripiprazole
      exhibits typical antagonism at dopamine (D2) receptors in the mesolimbic pathway,
      as well as having unique partial agonist activity at D2 receptors in the
      mesocortical pathway. As exemplified by other atypical antipsychotics, it
      displays strong 5-HT(2a) receptor antagonism and is similar to ziprasidone in
      also having agonistic activity at the 5-HT(1a) receptor. Among the atypical
      antipsychotics, aripiprazole displays the lowest affinity for alpha(1)adrenergic 
      (alpha(1)), histamine (H1) and muscarinic (M1) receptors. This combination of
      effects may be responsible for its efficacy in positive and negative symptoms of 
      schizophrenia and in bipolar disorder. Similarly, this profile may be the reason 
      for the low rates of reported side effects observed. This includes general
      adverse events, a low incidence of reported weight gain and a low liability for
      inducing movement disorders. Other early data suggest that aripiprazole may
      induce reductions in plasma prolactin, as well as in plasma glucose and lipid
      profiles. Finally, results also support the proposition that aripiprazole may
      lead to reductions in corrected QT interval and have minimal drug interactions.

TI  - Donepezil for the treatment of behavioral symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's
      disease.
PG  - 313-7
AB  - Behavioral and psychologic symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are common manifestations 
      in mid- and late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Traditional treatments for BPSD 
      are neuroleptics and sedatives, which are not devoid of serious adverse effects. 
      A number of studies show beneficial effects in the treatment of BPSD with
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI). The present study aimed to evaluate the 
      effect of donepezil (using the generic drug Memorit) as monotherapy for AD
      patients suffering from BPSD. Twenty-eight consecutive patients followed at the
      Memory Outpatient Clinic and Psychogeriatric Department of the Abarbanel Mental
      Health Center were treated with donepezil for 6 months. Starting dose was 5 mg
      daily during the first 4 weeks and continuation with 10 mg daily thereafter.
      Treatment effects were evaluated using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
      the Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Clinical Global Impression of
      Change Scale (CGIC) caregiver version. Twenty-four of 28 patients completed the
      study. Of these, five patients needed additional rescue neuroleptic treatment due
      to incomplete response. The mean dose of donepezil was 9.10 mg/day (median 10
      mg/day). The overall NPI improved significantly from 33.4 to 21.2 (p = 0.008).
      The mean CGIC at study's end was 3.0 (mild improvement). The cognitive scores did
      not change significantly. When compared to the patients who completed the study, 
      patients who discontinued had higher mean scores on the irritability and
      agitation subscales of the NPI, they were older, and they had longer disease
      duration and lower MMSE mean scores. Three adverse events were recorded: one
      syncope causing a toe phalanx fracture and gastrointestinal complaints that
      resolved over time in two additional patients. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
      should be considered for the treatment of BPSD before neuroleptic treatment is
      instituted in AD patients with low levels of irritability and agitation.

PG  - 303-6
AB  - The safety and tolerability of quetiapine (up to 75 mg/day) as monotherapy on
      essential tremor were investigated in an open-label study in 10 patients. Five
      men and 5 women, with a mean age of 66.3 years, affected by essential tremor
      participated in the trial. They were treated with increasing doses of quetiapine 
      to 75 mg/day over a 6-week period. Side effects included a paradoxical
      psychiatric reaction in one and anger in another, and in both cases quetiapine
      was discontinued. In two other patients, somnolence led to dose reduction. There 
      were no pre- versus post-treatment differences, but 3 out of 10 patients
      benefited (improvement >20%). Although the study was not powered to assess
      efficacy, quetiapine seems to be a safe drug for the treatment of essential
      tremor.

      episode patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
PG  - 69-81
AB  - The course of cognitive functioning over a 1-year period was examined among a
      community cohort of individuals presenting with first episode schizophrenia
      spectrum psychosis. Data were obtained for 83 outpatients at entry to an early
      intervention program and 12 months later on the National Adult Reading Test,
      Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales-Third Edition, Wechsler Memory Scales-Third
      Edition, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop
      Colour and Word Test, Trail Making Test, Continuous Performance Task and
      Thurstone Word Fluency Test. Paired sample t-tests indicated significant and
      positive changes in verbal and non-verbal intelligence, auditory and visual
      memory, working memory and some aspects of executive functioning. Processing
      speed also improved though remained an area of relative weakness for this sample.
      Findings indicated generally average performance at both assessment periods.
      Neither gender nor duration of untreated psychosis were related to the degree of 
      change in cognitive functioning for this sample. The implications of these
      findings and the impact of early intervention with this population are discussed.

PG  - 1354-9
AB  - The metric properties of the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) 
      were examined in 182 subjects treated with antipsychotics. Inter-rater
      reliability, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity with other rating
      scales for EPS were high. Four factors were identified and the optimal diagnostic
      cut-off scores were obtained. These results suggest that the DIEPSS is a reliable
      and valid multidimensional rating scale.

TI  - Sublingual atropine for sialorrhea secondary to parkinsonism: a pilot study.
PG  - 1318-20
AB  - Sialorrhea is a relatively common symptom in idiopathic Parkinson's disease and
      related conditions for which most of the accepted treatments are either highly
      invasive or may cause substantial systemic side effects. This study describes an 
      open-label pilot study of sublingual atropine drops for the treatment of
      sialorrhea in 7 patients (6 with Parkinson's disease, 1 with progressive
      supranuclear palsy). Participants demonstrated statistically significant declines
      in saliva production, both objectively and subjectively. Self-reported drooling
      severity showed a significant decline between baseline and 180 minutes, t(6) =
      3.240 P < 0.025 (eta(2) = 0.636), and between baseline and 1 week, t(6) = 4.583 P
      < 0.005 (eta(2) = 0.778). Objectively measured saliva production decreased
      significantly between baseline and the 1-week follow-up, t(6) = 2.711 P < 0.05
      (eta(2) = 0.551). Delirium occurred in 1 patient (concurrent with a urinary tract
      infection), and 2 patients experienced worsening of hallucinations (active
      hallucinosis was concealed by both individuals to allow participation in the
      trial). The remaining trial participants did not experience any anticholinergic
      side effects. This trial shows that, in selected patient populations, sublingual 
      atropine is a simple and inexpensive treatment for sialorrhea associated with
      parkinsonism.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and safety assessments of galantamine and risperidone after the
      two drugs are administered alone and together.
PG  - 1341-51
AB  - To explore the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile after coadministration of
      galantamine and risperidone, an open-label, randomized, single-center, two-way
      crossover drug-drug interaction study was conducted in 16 healthy elderly
      subjects, ages 60 years and older. The results showed that risperidone, when
      administered with galantamine, did not change the bioavailability of galantamine 
      at steady state. In addition, systemic exposure of risperidone active moiety
      (risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone), the most clinically relevant component
      of risperidone treatment, was not affected by galantamine coadministration, while
      systemic exposure was increased by approximately 10% for risperidone and
      decreased by about 10% for 9-hydroxyrisperidone (active metabolite of
      risperidone). Galantamine and risperidone were both safe and well tolerated
      administered either alone or together. Thus, no dose adjustment for either
      risperidone orgalantamine is necessary when these two drugs are administered
      together in the dose range evaluated.

TI  - An economic assessment of quetiapine and haloperidol in patients with
      schizophrenia only partially responsive to conventional antipsychotics.
PG  - 1648-67
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with schizophrenia exhibit only a partial response to
      conventional antipsychotic agents, making them difficult to treat adequately.
      OBJECTIVE: This analysis models the cost-effectiveness of quetiapine compared
      with haloperidol in partial responders with schizophrenia. METHODS: Outcome data 
      from the Partial Responders International schiZophrenia Evaluation (PRIZE)
      clinical trial comparing quetiapine and haloperidol in partial responders with
      schizophrenia as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fourth Edition were combined with data from the literature to
      construct a Markov model. The model was used to calculate treatment outcomes and 
      total direct treatment costs from the perspective of the United Kingdom National 
      Health Service over 5 years. RESULTS: The PRIZE study showed that quetiapine
      treatment resulted in a higher response rate and better tolerability than
      haloperidol treatment. These benefits have the potential to improve compliance
      and reduce relapse rates. The model showed that the higher acquisition cost of
      quetiapine was offset by lower costs for other medications, hospitalization, and 
      other medical services. The total treatment cost over 5 years was 38,106 pounds
      for quetiapine and 38,350 pounds for haloperidol, a cost saving of 244 pounds in 
      favor of quetiapine. Quetiapine-treated patients also spent longer in response
      states and experienced fewer relapses. Sensitivity analysis showed these results 
      to be robust across a range of conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Quetiapine has the
      potential to improve outcomes compared with haloperidol in partial responders
      with schizophrenia, at a slightly lower total cost. The higher acquisition cost
      of quetiapine was offset by savings in other medical costs. Quetiapine could
      significantly improve the management of this patient group, without increasing
      the economic burden on the health service.

TI  - Is theory of mind in schizophrenia more strongly associated with clinical and
      social functioning than with neurocognitive deficits?
PG  - 280-8
AB  - This paper examines the correlations between 'Theory of Mind' (ToM) and
      neurocognitive performance, together with clinical and social functioning, in
      out-patients with schizophrenic disorders. It was hypothesised that, since the
      ability to make inferences about the environment and about other peoples' mental 
      states is a key ingredient of social competence, the assessment of ToM would
      correlate more strongly with current social functioning than with more
      traditional neurocognitive measures. 'Independent raters' assessed Theory of
      Mind, neurocognitive and clinical variables as well as community functioning in
      44 subjects with schizophrenia. The neuropsychological measures were more closely
      associated with community functioning than with psychiatric symptoms. These
      associations remained evident when the effects of intelligence were controlled.
      Patients with a higher level of competence in making social inferences had better
      overall community functioning than those who showed less ability in this aspect
      of social cognition. In a regression model, the capacity to comprehend other
      people's mental states (ToM-2) was among the best predictors of global social
      functioning, together with recent onset of illness, good verbal fluency and low
      levels of negative and positive symptoms. These results are consistent with other
      recent findings. ToM measures of social cognition may be a useful addition to
      neuropsychological assessment when developing programmes for reducing clinical
      impairments and improving the community functioning of subjects with
      schizophrenic disorders. Further studies are needed to verify the value of these 
      measures as predictors of the successful application of specific psychosocial
      rehabilitation strategies.

TI  - Dose-related effects of amisulpride on five dimensions of psychopathology in
      patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.
PG  - 554-60
AB  - The present analysis investigated symptom-specific dose-response relationships of
      the atypical antipsychotic amisulpride (AMI) in schizophrenic patients. The
      effects of different AMI doses on five different symptom dimensions of the Brief 
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were analyzed. Results on global efficacy and
      safety parameters have been previously published. Four AMI doses (100 mg/day
      [AMI100], 400 mg/day [AMI400], 800 mg/day [AMI800], 1200 mg/day) were compared
      with 16 mg haloperidol (HAL16) in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
      parallel-group, 4-week trial. A total of 319 patients with acute exacerbation of 
      schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were included. AMI100 was compared with the other AMI
      doses, and HAL16 was compared with all AMI dosage groups. Response on BPRS
      factors defined as > or = 40% improvement and ORs were computed. An optimal AMI
      dose was calculated for each BPRS factor based on linear and quadratic
      regression. For all BPRS factors, inverted u-shaped dose-response curves emerged 
      (r2 > 95%). The estimated AMI dose optimum for the BPRS factors activation/
      agitation (760 mg), thought disturbances (716 mg), and hostility/suspiciousness
      (694 mg) was higher than that for anergia/negative symptoms (584 mg) and
      depression/anxiety (672 mg). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were found for
      AMI400/800 versus AMI100 (thought disturbances, hostility/ suspiciousness), for
      AMI400/800 versus HAL16 (depression/anxiety, thought disturbances,
      hostility/suspiciousness), and for AMI400 versus HAL16 (anergia/negative
      symptoms). ORs for response of the BPRS factors depression/anxiety,
      anergia/negative symptoms, and hostility/suspiciousness were highest under
      treatment with AMI400 compared to AMI100 and HAL16. For the BPRS factors thought 
      disturbances and activation/agitation, the highest response chance emerged under 
      AMI800 compared to AMI100 or HAL16. AMI seems to show the best clinical efficacy 
      in acutely schizophrenic patients in a moderate dose (400-800 mg/day), with a
      somewhat lower dose optimum for negative than for positive symptoms. The present 
      finding of distinct dose-response relationships of AMI regarding the BPRS
      dimensions is in accordance with studies on the mechanism of action of AMI and
      provides a useful rationale for the clinical treatment of schizophrenic patients 
      with AMI.

TI  - Glucose intolerance with atypical antipsychotics.
PG  - 1107-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that the atypical antipsychotics
      clozapine and olanzapine may be associated with an increased risk of glucose
      intolerance and diabetes mellitus. Early studies have also suggested an
      association between use of conventional antipsychotics and the development of
      glucose intolerance. OBJECTIVE: To examine quantitatively the association between
      glucose intolerance including diabetes mellitus and the use of the atypical
      antipsychotics clozapine, olanzapine or risperidone, and to identify possible
      risk factors for the development of glucose intolerance during treatment with
      these drugs. METHODS: All reports suggestive of glucose intolerance for
      clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone were identified in the WHO database for
      adverse drug reactions. In the analyses of possible risk factors for glucose
      intolerance all other reports of adverse drug reactions for clozapine, olanzapine
      and risperidone were used as reference. Using the Bayesian Confidence Propagation
      Neural Network method, the strengths of the associations over time between
      glucose intolerance and the use of these drugs were analysed. For comparison, the
      strengths of the associations between glucose intolerance and the use of the
      conventional antipsychotics haloperidol and chlorpromazine were also analysed.
      RESULTS: Clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone were significantly associated with
      glucose intolerance. In contrast, chlorpromazine and haloperidol were not
      associated with glucose intolerance. For clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone
      grouped together, the following potential risk factors for glucose intolerance
      were identified: an underlying diabetic condition (odds ratio [OR] 10.22, 95% CI 
      8.20-12.73), an increase in weight (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.76-3.17), male gender (OR
      1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.47), and concomitant use of valproic acid (OR 1.97, 95% CI
      1.61-2.40), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.33-1.99)
      or buspirone (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.33-3.77). CONCLUSION: Treatment with clozapine,
      olanzapine or risperidone appears to be associated with an increased risk of
      glucose intolerance.

TI  - Olanzapine vs. haloperidol in the treatment of elderly chronic schizophrenia
      patients.
PG  - 1199-202
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most of the data supporting the use of atypical antipsychotics (AA) is
      based on studies in young adult patients. The present study is an open-label
      naturalistic follow-up study of olanzapine treatment vs. haloperidol for elderly 
      chronic schizophrenia patients. MEHTOD: 20 patients (mean age 72.7+/-5.9 years,
      mean disease duration 33.1+/-12.0 years) who met the DSM-IV criteria for
      schizophrenia were randomly assigned to olanzapine (n=10) or haloperidol (n=10)
      treatment during acute exacerbation. Primary outcome measure was rating on the
      Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale and the Positive and Negative Symptom
      Scale (PANSS). RESULTS: Between-group differences were computed using analysis of
      covariance. PANSS Total score decreased from 84 at baseline to 65 after treatment
      with olanzapine while decreased only from 79 to 74 with haloperidol treatment (F=
      6.66, P=.02). PANSS Negative subscale decreased from 19 at baseline to 15 with
      olanzapine treatment while increased (deteriorated) from 18 to 20 with
      haloperidol treatment (F=23.37, P=.0003). CGI decreased from baseline with both
      olanzapine and haloperidol treatments (1.1 vs. 0.4) but the decrease in the
      olanzapine group was significantly greater (F=4.63, P=.05). Mean weight increased
      in both groups but without statistical difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In
      elderly chronic schizophrenia patients, olanzapine treatment is superior to
      haloperidol in reducing negative symptoms as well as less induction of
      extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).

TI  - Depression and dysphoria in adult and adolescent patients with Tourette's
      disorder treated with risperidone.
PG  - 1040-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a common comorbid condition in patients with Tourette's
      disorder. While risperidone is not usually known to induce dysphoria or
      depression in patients treated for other psychiatric disorders, previous
      short-term 4- to 12-week trials of risperidone for Tourette's disorder have
      reported a 2.6% to 30.8% incidence of depression. METHOD: A retrospective study
      was carried out in 58 adult and adolescent patients with Tourette's disorder
      (Tourette Syndrome Classification Study Group diagnosis) who received risperidone
      between Jan. 1, 1993, and Dec. 31, 2000, at the Allan Memorial Institute, McGill 
      University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Charts of all patients were
      examined for evidence of, and risk factors for, DSM-IV-defined major depressive
      disorder (MDD) or dysphoria. RESULTS: Seventeen (29.3%) of 58 patients developed 
      MDD, including 1 patient who later committed suicide and 13 patients (22.4%) who 
      became dysphoric while taking risperidone. Nine of the 17 patients who developed 
      MDD were relapses, i.e., patients with a history of depression prior to taking
      risperidone, while the remainder were new cases, i.e., patients with no previous 
      history of depression. A positive personal history of MDD was the only factor to 
      significantly (p <.001) predict the development of depression while taking
      risperidone. Seventy percent of those who developed MDD or dysphoria and
      discontinued risperidone did so specifically as a result of this adverse event.
      CONCLUSION: MDD and dysphoria commonly occurred in this cohort of adult and
      adolescent Tourette's disorder patients treated with risperidone, particularly in
      patients with a previous history of depression. Depression and dysphoria were
      frequent reasons for risperidone discontinuation.

TI  - Quetiapine: an effective antipsychotic in first-episode schizophrenia despite
      only transiently high dopamine-2 receptor blockade.
PG  - 992-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that transiently high dopamine-2 (D(2))
      receptor occupancy by antipsychotic medication may be sufficient for inducing an 
      antipsychotic response. We treated patients experiencing their first episode of
      schizophrenia with a single daily dose of quetiapine to achieve a transient daily
      peak of D(2) receptor blockade, to determine if this would lead to an
      antipsychotic response. METHOD: Fourteen patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of
      schizophrenia or schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorder were treated with
      quetiapine titrated to a single daily dose (mean +/- SD dose at the time of the
      positron emission tomography [PET] scan = 427 +/- 69 mg) for 12 weeks. Peak D(2) 
      occupancy approximately 2 hours postdose and trough D(2) occupancy approximately 
      20 hours postdose were determined using PET and [(11)C]raclopride. Clinical
      symptoms and side effects were measured at baseline and every 2 weeks during the 
      treatment phase. RESULTS: Quetiapine administration led to a mean peak D(2)
      occupancy of 62% +/- 10% 2 hours postdose, which declined to 14% +/- 8%
      approximately 20 hours postdose. Ten (71%) of 14 patients responded to treatment 
      with quetiapine, scoring "much improved" or greater on the Clinical Global
      Impressions-Improvement scale. Plasma drug levels and peak D(2) occupancy were
      highly correlated (r = 0.84; p =.003), as were prolactin and plasma drug levels
      when measured 2.5 hours after drug administration (r = 0.60; p <.05). Mean weight
      gain for the 10 subjects who completed the 12-week study was 4.2 +/- 4.6 kg (9.3 
      +/- 10.2 lb). No clinically relevant motor side effects occurred during the
      trial. CONCLUSION: Patients with a first episode of schizophrenia responded to
      treatment with a single daily dose of quetiapine despite only transiently high
      D(2) receptor occupancy. Our findings raise the question of whether continuously 
      high D(2) blockade is necessary for obtaining an antipsychotic response. Future
      studies aimed at evaluating the relative merits of "transiently high" versus
      "continuously high" D(2) occupancy are warranted.

TI  - Impact of risperidone versus haloperidol on activities of daily living in the
      treatment of refractory schizophrenia.
PG  - 469-73
AB  - Risperidone has been shown to improve verbal working memory, executive
      functioning, attention, reaction time, and verbal learning, which, in turn, have 
      been associated with improved functional outcomes. We tested whether risperidone 
      was associated with greater improvements than haloperidol in activities of daily 
      living (ADLs) among persons having treatment-refractory schizophrenia. In a
      double-blind, controlled trial of fixed and flexible doses of haloperidol and
      risperidone, changes in ADLs were operationally monitored on a behavior therapy
      unit of a state hospital. While no differential effects were noted between
      risperidone and haloperidol in ADLS, these self-care skills significantly
      improved as subjects spent longer times on the behavior therapy unit. Working
      memory and verbal learning did correlate with improvements in ADLs, independent
      of drug condition. The contingencies of reinforcement and specific training
      programs on the behavior therapy unit may have been prepotent for the learning of
      ADLs, obscuring any differential impact of risperidone. Moreover, ADLs may be
      governed more by "procedural" learning than by working memory or verbal learning,
      with the former not differentially influenced by typical verus atypical
      antipsychotics.

TI  - Evaluating the consistency of pharmacotherapy exposure by use of state-of-the-art
      techniques.
PG  - 696-705
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examine the usefulness of population pharmacokinetics
      coupled with electronic compliance monitoring in evaluating consistency of
      exposure to pharmacotherapy. Adherence to pharmacotherapy can have a significant 
      impact on drug response, especially in the treatment of schizophrenia and
      depression. Previous studies evaluating antipsychotics identified schizophrenic
      individuals with poor pharmacotherapy adherence as having a higher risk of
      rehospitalization. Other investigators have shown a relationship between pattern 
      of taking selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and probability of a
      positive outcome. Therefore, it is important to measure adherence patterns in
      clinical trials evaluating these treatments and to incorporate this information
      into the research findings. METHODS: Two multisite trials with atypical
      antipsychotics and antidepressants were simulated to evaluate, by use of
      population pharmacokinetic methods, the impact of electronic monitoring on
      measuring consistency of exposure to pharmacotherapy. One of the trials is
      ongoing and evaluates exposure to atypical antipsychotics, and the other is a
      proposed trial that examines exposure to an SSRI. RESULTS: Erratic exposure
      patterns were detected with population pharmacokinetic techniques in the absence 
      of Electronic Medication Event Monitoring (MEMS) data. In our simulations, the
      use of electronic monitoring improved the identification of atypical exposure by 
      population pharmacokinetics both for the atypical antipsychotics and SSRIs.
      CONCLUSION: Our simulations demonstrate the potential usefulness of the
      combination of population pharmacokinetics with electronic monitoring as a robust
      method for accurately and precisely capturing both magnitude and consistency of
      pharmacotherapy exposure.

TI  - Classical and atypical neuroleptics, and bone mineral density, in patients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 817-28
AB  - There are some reports that classical neuroleptics may lead to osteoporosis or
      reduced bone mineral density (BMD). However, there is no adequate information
      about the effects of atypical neuroleptics on BMD. The aim of this study was to
      measure BMD in schizophrenic patients taking classical and atypical neuroleptics,
      compared to healthy controls. Seventy-five patients with schizophrenia (40 taking
      classical neuroleptics [CN], 35 taking atypical neuroleptics [AN]) and 20 healthy
      controls (HC) were included in the study. Spine (L1-L4) BMD was measured by
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. ANOVA showed that BMD was higher in HC than AN 
      and CN. In addition, there was a negative correlation between the duration of
      neuroleptic treatment and BMD and the duration of the illness. These findings
      suggest that atypical neuroleptics may be safer than the classical neuroleptics
      in terms of reduced BMD.

      cohort study using administrative data.
PG  - 1070
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the rates of cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia in
      patients with treated schizophrenia and in non-schizophrenic controls. DESIGN:
      Cohort study of outpatients using administrative data. SETTING: 3 US Medicaid
      programmes. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine,
      haloperidol, risperidone, or thioridazine; a control group of patients with
      glaucoma; and a control group of patients with psoriasis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:
      Diagnosis of cardiac arrest or ventricular arrhythmia. RESULTS: Patients with
      treated schizophrenia had higher rates of cardiac arrest and ventricular
      arrhythmia than controls, with rate ratios ranging from 1.7 to 3.2. Overall,
      thioridazine was not associated with an increased risk compared with haloperidol 
      (rate ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.2). However, thioridazine
      showed an increased risk of events at doses > or =600 mg (2.6, 1.0 to 6.6;
      P=0.049) and a linear dose-response relation (P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The
      increased risk of cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia in patients with
      treated schizophrenia could be due to the disease or its treatment. Overall, the 
      risk with thioridazine was no worse than that with haloperidol. Thioridazine may,
      however, have a higher risk at high doses, although this finding could be due to 
      chance. To reduce cardiac risk, thioridazine should be prescribed at the lowest
      dose needed to obtain an optimal therapeutic effect.

TI  - An assessment of the independent effects of olanzapine and risperidone exposure
      on the risk of hyperlipidemia in schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 1021-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The newer antipsychotic agents exhibit a superior safety profile
      compared with conventional antipsychotic agents in terms of extrapyramidal
      symptoms. Previous studies have suggested an association between olanzapine
      treatment and hyperlipidemia. We evaluated this association using a large health 
      care database. METHODS: The study was derived from the England and Wales-based
      General Practice Research Database, composed of 3.5 million subjects followed up 
      between June 1, 1987, and September 24, 2000. A total of 18 309 individuals
      diagnosed as having schizophrenia were identified. A 6:1 matched nested
      case-control design was used. Conditional logistic regression was used to derive 
      adjusted odds ratios (ORs), controlling for sex, age, and other medications and
      disease conditions influencing lipid levels. Antipsychotic drug exposure was
      defined as the receipt of at least 1 prescription for an antipsychotic medication
      within the 3 months before the date of diagnosis of hyperlipidemia. RESULTS:
      There were 1268 incident cases of hyperlipidemia in the cohort, matched to 7598
      control subjects. Olanzapine use was associated with nearly a 5-fold increase in 
      the odds of developing hyperlipidemia compared with no antipsychotic exposure
      (OR, 4.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.44-8.85) (P<.001) and more than a
      3-fold increase compared with those receiving conventional agents (OR, 3.36; 95% 
      CI, 1.77-6.39) (P<.001). Risperidone was not associated with increased odds of
      hyperlipidemia compared with no antipsychotic exposure (OR, 1.12; 95% CI,
      0.60-2.11) (P =.72) or conventional antipsychotic exposure (OR, 0.81; 95% CI,
      0.44-1.52) (P =.52). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a strong association between
      olanzapine exposure and hyperlipidemia in schizophrenic patients. The possible
      metabolic consequences of olanzapine use should be given serious consideration by
      treating physicians.

TI  - Olanzapine in refractory schizophrenia after failure of typical or atypical
      antipsychotic treatment: an open-label switch study.
PG  - 931-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: When patients with schizophrenia fail to respond to an atypical
      antipsychotic, they are sometimes switched to another atypical compound. However,
      the benefits of such a switch have not been adequately studied. We present an
      open-label prospective 14-week trial with olanzapine in patients with
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder whose treatment resistance to
      clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol had been determined
      prospectively. METHOD: The subjects were 45 inpatients with DSM-IV schizophrenia 
      or schizoaffective disorder who failed to respond to treatment during a 14-week
      double-blind trial comparing clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol.
      The patients had been selected for participation in the double-blind trial on the
      basis of a history of suboptimal response to previous treatment. Inclusion
      criteria for the present study were (1) completion of at least 8 weeks of the
      14-week double-blind trial, (2) treatment resistance to 1 of the 4 compounds
      tested as evidenced by a decrease in total PANSS score of less than 20%, and (3) 
      total PANSS score > or = 60. Subjects were cross-titrated from the previous
      double-blind treatment to open-label olanzapine, 10 to 40 mg/day, and were
      treated for 14 weeks without concomitant psychotropic medication. Patients were
      evaluated weekly with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical 
      Global Impressions scale, and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. RESULTS:
      Open-label olanzapine treatment yielded no significant change in PANSS total,
      positive subscale, or negative subscale scores. There was a significant
      improvement for the PANSS cognitive factor (mean +/- SD change = 0.92 +/- 2.27; F
      = 7.5, df = 1,44; p <.009) and a marginally significant worsening for the
      excitement factor (mean change = -1.36 +/- 4.64; F = 4.0, df = 1,44; p < .053).
      Nine percent of patients (N = 4) were classified as responders using the Kane et 
      al. criteria. The worsening in the PANSS excitement factor was significantly
      associated with the length of illness (t = -2.10, df = 44, p < .04). There was a 
      nonsignificant decrease in extrapyramidal side effects and a significant increase
      in weight (mean increase = 3.5 +/- 6.2 kg [7.8 +/- 13.8 lb]; F = 5.29, df = 1,42;
      p <.0005). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that in patients with
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia, a switch to olanzapine after treatment failure
      with an atypical agent or haloperidol may not reduce psychopathology in general, 
      but may improve symptoms related to cognitive function.

PG  - 885-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine differences in the improvement
      of clinical psychopathology and in fine motor functions at 2 doses of risperidone
      in first-episode, acutely psychotic patients. METHOD: In a double-blind,
      fixed-dose study, 49 acutely psychotic, neuroleptic-naive patients who were
      admitted for the first time and who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia,
      schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to 
      2 or 4 mg/day of risperidone. Treatment efficacy was measured using the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, The 
      Clinical Global Impressions scale, and the Social and Occupational Functioning
      Assessment Scale. Fine motor functions were assessed using a computerized device 
      (the Vienna Test System) and were compared with those of a control group of 20
      healthy subjects who were matched for age, gender, and educational level.
      RESULTS: Treatment with doses of 2 and 4 mg of risperidone daily significantly
      reduced positive (p < .0001) and negative (p < .01) symptoms at 8 weeks. Although
      there were no significant differences in motor movements as measured using the
      Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Simpson-Angus Scale, computerized fine motor
      assessment showed significantly less motor dysfunction in the 2-mg/day group at 8
      weeks. No significant correlations to plasma concentration of active moiety were 
      found for data on psychopathology and fine motor functions. CONCLUSION: The 2
      doses of risperidone did not differ in terms of clinical improvement, but the
      2-mg/day dose produced fewer fine motor dysfunctions. These results suggest that 
      a dose as low as 2 mg/day of risperidone may be effective for patients with
      first-episode psychosis.

TI  - The effects of novel antipsychotics on glucose and lipid levels.
PG  - 856-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel antipsychotics are extensively used based on their
      favorable extrapyramidal side effect profiles. However, accumulating evidence
      suggests that these agents, particularly clozapine and olanzapine, have serious
      side effects of their own, including weight gain and elevated glucose and
      triglyceride levels. The goal of this study is to compare the effects of novel
      antipsychotics clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine and typical
      antipsychotics haloperidol and fluphenazine on glucose and lipid levels. METHOD: 
      The charts of 590 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Of those, 215 patients 
      had adequate laboratory data for inclusion. Glucose and lipid level data from 2
      1/2 years before and after initiation of the target antipsychotic were included. 
      Covariates, including patients' age, the duration of antipsychotic treatment,
      other medications that may affect glucose or lipid levels, and the initial
      laboratory values, were controlled for in the analyses. RESULTS: Glucose levels
      were increased from baseline for patients treated with clozapine, olanzapine, and
      haloperidol. There were statistically and clinically significant differences
      among the medications' effects on lipid profiles (p < .05). Those receiving
      clozapine and olanzapine demonstrated statistically significant increases in
      triglyceride levels compared with the other groups. Over one third of patients
      treated with any of the novel antipsychotics had clinically meaningful
      triglyceride elevations. CONCLUSION: It has been shown that novel antipsychotics 
      are associated with weight gain. This risk factor along with others, such as
      elevated glucose and triglyceride levels, compounds the risk for coronary artery 
      disease. Routine monitoring of glucose and lipid levels during treatment with
      novel antipsychotics should be advocated.

TI  - Cross-national cognitive assessment in schizophrenia clinical trials: a
      feasibility study.
PG  - 243-51
AB  - Clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia now often include cognitive
      assessments in addition to clinical ratings of symptoms. Recently, these trials
      have included cross-national assessments. It is not clear if translated
      psychological tests produce consistent results across different languages. This
      paper presents the results of a study of the comparability of the results of
      cognitive assessments in different English-speaking countries and a number of
      countries where tests were translated into other languages. Performance on tests 
      of executive functioning, verbal and visuo-spatial learning and memory, language 
      skills, psychomotor speed, and vigilance was compared across the first episode
      patients with schizophrenia (n = 301) assessed in six different languages
      (English, French, Finnish, German, Hebrew, and Afrikaans), including two
      different countries where patients were assessed in English and other languages: 
      Canada (French) and South Africa (Afrikaans). The variance in performance across 
      the sites tested in English was as large as the variance between English and
      non-English speakers when all tests were considered. Performance differences
      across English and other languages were found only for executive functions,
      vigilance, and psychomotor speed, with executive functioning differences
      nonsignificant when education was considered. No differences were found between
      English and non-English speakers in Canada. These results suggest that the
      translation of tests of memory and verbal skills can lead to consistent results
      across translated versions of the tests. Differences between countries were
      greater than differences between languages, suggesting the need to consider
      representativeness of patient samples in terms of local educational attainment.
      In general, these data support the validity of cross-national neuropsychological 
      assessments.

PG  - 225-32
AB  - Thirty-four-day treatment program clients diagnosed with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to a computer-assisted cognitive 
      rehabilitation (CACR) group or a wait-list Control group. CACR clients received
      16 CACR sessions over an 8-week period. Measures of cognitive functioning,
      negative symptoms and self-esteem were administered at the beginning and end of
      this period. CACR clients showed greater improvement in cognitive functioning
      (verbal memory and attention) and negative symptoms. Symptom reduction was not
      mediated by raised self-esteem. CACR's effects may go beyond cognitive
      remediation to include some of the most disabling and refractory clinical
      features of schizophrenia.

TI  - Serum glucose and lipid changes during the course of clozapine treatment: the
      effect of concurrent beta-adrenergic antagonist treatment.
PG  - 49-57
AB  - We examined the effects of long-term clozapine treatment, concurrent treatment
      with beta-adrenergic antagonists, and clozapine-induced weight gain on serum
      glucose and lipid measures. Fifty subjects met the DSM-III-R criteria for
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, participated in a 10-week,
      double-blind comparison of haloperidol and clozapine and a 1-year, open-label
      clozapine trial, and had available serum glucose and lipid levels. Weight and
      glucose, and lipid laboratory values were measured at the baseline and throughout
      the double-blind and year-long study. There were significant increases in serum
      triglyceride, total cholesterol, and glucose levels during the course of
      clozapine treatment. There were no significant changes in high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Propranolol and atenolol had 
      additive effects on changes in the total cholesterol and triglycerides, with
      propranolol having the most pronounced effects. Propranolol and atenolol had no
      significant effect on the serum glucose levels. There were significant
      correlations between the triglyceride and HDL level changes and
      clozapine-associated weight gain during the study. There were no significant
      correlations between the change in serum total cholesterol, LDL, or glucose and
      weight gain. Clozapine therapy has adverse effects on glucose and lipid
      homeostasis, with clozapine-induced changes in serum glucose likely due to the
      inherent pharmacological properties of clozapine. Concurrent beta-adrenergic
      receptor antagonist treatment may have an additive effect on serum lipids, and
      clozapine-associated weight gain also plays a modest role in triglyceride
      increases.

TI  - Amoxapine shows atypical antipsychotic effects in patients with schizophrenia:
      results from a prospective open-label study.
PG  - 35-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Amoxapine is marketed as an antidepressant. However, its receptor
      occupancy, in vitro and in vivo, and its effects in pre-clinical models are very 
      similar to atypical antipsychotics. To examine if this leads to an atypical
      antipsychotic effect in the clinical context, the authors examined the
      antipsychotic and side-effect profile of amoxapine in acutely psychotic patients 
      with schizophrenia. METHODS: Seventeen patients were enrolled and 15 completed a 
      prospective open-label 6-week study of amoxapine starting with a fixed-starting
      dose (150 mg/h) with standardized titration up to 250 mg/h, if required.
      Positive, negative, affective symptoms and side-effects were monitored using
      standardized weekly assessments. RESULTS: Amoxapine (median final dose 210 mg/h) 
      was well-tolerated and showed significant improvement in positive and negative
      symptoms (both p<0.001), with a trend towards improvement in mood symptoms and no
      treatment-emergent extrapyramidal side-effects, akathisia or weight gain.
      Prolactin elevation was observed. CONCLUSION: These clinical data lend support to
      the pre-clinical suggestions that amoxapine may be an atypical antipsychotic.
      Given its lack of weight gain and that it is considerably less expensive than
      current options, amoxapine could be a valuable alternative for some patients.
      These considerations strongly call for more systematic, double-blind studies of
      amoxapine as an atypical antipsychotic.

TI  - An open-labeled trial of adjunctive donepezil for cognitive impairments in
      patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - A pilot study was conducted to examine if donepezil could enhance cognitive
      function in patients with schizophrenia. Fifteen subjects who were on stable
      olanzapine treatment were entered into a 6-week open-labeled trial of donepezil. 
      Subjects received baseline and end-of-study P50 and neuropsychological
      assessments. Donepezil treatment resulted in significant improvement in manual
      dexterity. There were moderate improvements in verbal recall memory and visual
      memory and processing speed, with smaller changes in P50 and verbal recognition
      memory. There was no effect on an attention measure. There were no changes in
      either positive or negative symptoms. These results suggest that cholinergic tone
      modulation may enhance selective behavioral functions in patients with
      schizophrenia, but further study is required to delineate the full extent of the 
      potential benefit of this approach.

TI  - The effect of melperone, an atypical antipsychotic drug, on cognitive function in
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 7-16
AB  - Melperone, a butyrophenone, has been shown to possess atypical antipsychotic
      properties, i.e. ability to produce an antipsychotic effect in man at doses that 
      cause minimal extrapyramidal side effects. In addition, melperone shares the
      following with other atypical antipsychotic drugs: (1) effectiveness for
      ameliorating negative symptoms; (2) no prolactin elevation; and (3) effectiveness
      in the treatment of some patients with neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia. Other
      atypical antipsychotic drugs have been reported to improve cognitive function.
      This study was performed to investigate the effect of melperone on cognitive
      function. Nineteen patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder,
      including 11 neuroleptic-resistant patients, were treated with melperone for 6
      weeks. A comprehensive neurocognitive test battery and psychopathological ratings
      (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, BPRS) were administered at baseline and after 6 
      weeks of melperone treatment. Treatment with melperone was associated with
      improvement in executive function, as measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
      (WCST)-Categories and WCST-Percent Perseveration. On the other hand, visuospatial
      manipulation, as measured by the Wechsler Intelligent Scale for Children-Revised 
      (WISC-R) Maze, worsened during melperone treatment. There were no significant
      changes in other domains of cognition, i.e. verbal learning and memory, verbal
      working memory, verbal fluency and sustained attention. Scores of WCST-Categories
      and Perseveration at 6 weeks were predicted from the relevant cognitive test
      scores at baseline and the change in BPRS Total and Positive scores. These
      results suggest the usefulness of melperone for facilitating work and social
      function in patients with schizophrenia. The differences in the
      cognition-enhancing abilities between melperone and clozapine are discussed.

TI  - Mental disorder and perceived threat to the public: people who do not return to
      community living.
PG  - 399-405
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the UK, people with mental disorder thought to pose a high risk of
      harm to others are usually put in a high-security (special) hospital. Little is
      known about what happens after that. AIMS: To test a hypothesis that, under
      current services and laws (from the mid-1980s), no one leaving high-security
      hospitals remains indefinitely institutionalised. METHOD: The special hospitals' 
      case register was used for case ascertainment and admission data; post-discharge 
      data were collected from multiple sources on patients discharged in 1984 (census 
      date 31.12.1995). RESULTS: In this discharge cohort (n=223), 36 (17%) did not
      return to the community: 17 died in special hospital and 19 continuously lived in
      other institutions until death or the census date. Over two-thirds of these had
      mental illness, were older on admission and had lived longer in special hospital 
      than their better-rehabilitated peers. Offending history was irrelevant to this. 
      Most post-discharge institution time was in open psychiatric hospital, or back in
      special hospital, not in medium secure units or prison. CONCLUSIONS: The
      hypothesis was not sustained, but fewer people never reached the community than
      before the mid-1980s. Atypical antipsychotics might reduce this number. We found 
      no justification for a new tier of long-term medium secure units.

TI  - Olanzapine for Huntington's disease: an open label study.
PG  - 263-5
AB  - The aim of this prospective open label study was to assess the efficacy of
      olanzapine for motor symptoms in Huntington's disease (HD). Olanzapine was
      administrated to nine patients with genetically confirmed HD in increasing doses 
      until satisfactory clinical effect or the appearance of side effects. The
      patients were evaluated at baseline and after 14 days of treatment using the
      motor scale of the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS). The patients improved
      significantly in most subscores of the UHDRS, including fine motor tasks,
      although some patients needed a rather high dose (30 mg per day). No adverse
      effects were reported by the patents spontaneously or were observed directly by
      the investigator. High-dose olanzapine seems to be useful in choreatic HD
      patients. A double blind, placebo-controlled trial appears warranted to
      definitively establish the symptomatic value of olanzapine in HD.

TI  - Longitudinal follow-up of neurochemical changes during the first year of
      antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia patients with minimal previous
      medication exposure.
PG  - 313-21
AB  - Reduced frontal N-acetylaspartate (NAA) has been repeatedly found in chronic
      schizophrenia and suggests neuronal loss or dysfunction. However, the potential
      confounding effect of antipsychotic drugs on NAA has not been resolved. The few
      studies of antipsychotic-nai;ve patients are inconclusive. A recent report
      suggests that antipsychotic drugs may increase NAA in the dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (DLPFC). We studied 10 minimally treated (less than 3 weeks lifetime
      exposure) schizophrenia patients and 10 normal controls with single-voxel proton 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the left frontal and occipital lobes.
      Concentrations of NAA, Cho, and Cre were determined and corrected for the
      proportion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the voxel. Patients were treated in a 
      randomized-controlled double-blind design with either haloperidol or quetiapine. 
      1H-MRS was repeated within a year. There were no differences in frontal or
      occipital NAA between patients and controls at baseline. However, frontal NAA was
      reduced in the schizophrenia group within the first year of treatment. Patients
      had a clear clinical response to treatment but changes in frontal NAA were not
      correlated with symptom improvement. The well-described reduced frontal NAA in
      schizophrenia may not be a trait of the illness but may represent medication
      effect or progression of the disease.

TI  - Depressive symptoms at baseline predict fewer negative symptoms at follow-up in
      patients with first-episode schizophrenia.
PG  - 247-52
AB  - There is uncertainty regarding the prognostic value of depressive symptoms in
      schizophrenia, having previously been associated with both favourable and poor
      outcome. This study investigated the relationship between baseline depressive
      symptoms and treatment outcome at 6, 12 and 24 weeks in 80 subjects with
      first-episode schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder in terms of PANSS total 
      and subscale score changes. No significant association was found between baseline
      PANSS depression factor scores and PANSS total and subscore changes. However, a
      significant inverse correlation between baseline depression scores and negative
      scores at 6, 12 and 24 weeks was found (p=0.044, 0.023 and 0.012, respectively). 
      Multiple regression analysis indicated that this finding could not be explained
      on the basis of age, gender or duration of untreated psychosis. These findings
      support previous work suggesting that high baseline depressive scores predict
      favourable outcome.

TI  - Effects of antipsychotics on prepulse inhibition of the startle response in
      drug-naive schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 863-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disturbances in sensorimotor gating measured by prepulse inhibition
      of the startle response (PPI) have frequently been reported in medicated and
      unmedicated schizophrenia spectrum patients and in their relatives, suggesting
      that the deficit represents a stable vulnerability marker for schizophrenia.
      Clinical data on the effects of antipsychotics on PPI disturbances are scarce,
      but from preclinical studies, antipsychotics have been shown to influence PPI. To
      differentiate pathogenetic mechanisms from drug related effects, longitudinal
      clinical studies on the effect of antipsychotic treatment on PPI in drug-naive
      first-episode schizophrenic patients are needed. METHODS: First-episode
      schizophrenic patients never previously medicated with antipsychotics were
      examined at inclusion and after 3 months of treatment with the atypical
      antipsychotic compound, risperidone, or the typical drug, zuclopenthixol. Healthy
      controls were used as a comparison group. RESULTS: The results confirm deficits
      in PPI in drug-naive first-episode patients. No effect of antipsychotic treatment
      on PPI dysfunction was observed in any of the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      data are the first to show the possible effect of treatment with antipsychotic
      drugs on PPI disturbances in a longitudinal study of drug-naive schizophrenic
      patients. The data do not support any influence of treatment with antipsychotic
      drugs on sensorimotor gating deficits. Instead, the results point to the
      impairment in PPI as a stable vulnerability indicator.

TI  - Sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease: epidemiology and management.
PG  - 733-9
AB  - Sleep problems are an under-emphasised cause of disability in Parkinson's disease
      (PD) and may be seen independently of PD, associated with primary PD pathology,
      or as a result of antiparkinsonian medications. Common sleep disorders include
      excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder, 
      night-time wakefulness and restless legs syndrome. A number of strategies may be 
      used to improve sleep cycle disturbances, and often these interventions do not
      require pharmacological manipulation. Restoring traditional mealtimes and
      scheduling activities during predicted periods of sleepiness may help alleviate
      daytime somnolence; the use of controlled-release levodopa preparations or
      administration of a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor with levodopa 
      at bedtime may reduce periods of night-time wakefulness. Administration of
      clonazepam at bedtime may assist with REM sleep behaviour disorder but, because
      this agent can result in daytime somnolence, experimentation with dosage times is
      recommended. Sleep attacks are described as a sudden, unavoidable transition from
      wakefulness to sleep and, although rare, have been described with pramipexole,
      ropinirole and other dopamine agonists. Although the condition has yet to be
      recognised by the International Association of Sleep Disorders, patients with PD 
      who report rapid sleep onset should be evaluated for the possibility of sleep
      attacks. If sleep attacks are suspected, it is reasonable to strongly caution
      patients regarding potentially risk-associated activities such as driving, and to
      consider careful withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy.

TI  - Developments in the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 1335-41
AB  - Schizophrenia is, at once, a biological disease, a neuropsychological disorder
      and a dysfunction of social interactions. This presents clinicians with a series 
      of problems with regards to therapy. In the first section of this article, some
      of the clinical challenges that face those attempting to develop new drugs, are
      summarised. Several potential pharmacological therapeutic targets that have been,
      and are continuing to be used, in the development of new antipsychotic drugs, are
      then considered. This is followed by an outline of the pharmacological and
      clinical profiles of some of the newer generation antipsychotics, as well as
      investigational drugs in the pipeline for schizophrenia. Finally, the
      implications of the introduction of these new drugs for the management of
      schizophrenia, are discussed.

TI  - Aripiprazole.
PG  - 779-86; discussion 787-8
AB  - Aripiprazole is a quinolinone derivative and the first of a new class of atypical
      antipsychotics. The drug has partial agonist activity at dopamine D(2) and
      serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptors, and is also an antagonist at 5-HT(2A) receptors. In
      patients with acute relapse of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder,
      aripiprazole 15 to 30 mg/day was at least as effective as haloperidol 10 mg/day
      and had similar efficacy to risperidone 6 mg/day in well designed, 4-week,
      placebo-controlled trials. Negative symptoms improved earlier in the aripiprazole
      than the risperidone group. Efficacy of aripiprazole was observed at week 1 in
      several trials and was sustained throughout the study periods. Aripiprazole was
      superior to placebo in a 26-week trial in patients with stable, chronic
      schizophrenia. In a 52-week trial involving patients with acute relapsing
      disease, aripiprazole was similar to haloperidol as assessed by time to failure
      to maintain response and was superior in ameliorating negative and depressive
      symptoms. The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms during aripiprazole therapy
      was similar to that with risperidone and placebo but lower than with haloperidol.
      Compared with placebo, the proportion of patients with increased plasma prolactin
      levels and QTc prolongation was similar in patients treated with aripiprazole 15 
      to 30 mg/day but was significantly increased with haloperidol and risperidone.

TI  - How much are atypical antipsychotic agents being used, and do they reach the
      populations who need them? A Canadian experience.
PG  - 1466-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: The introduction of new antipsychotic agents in the past decade has
      helped alter the treatments available to 2 vulnerable populations-those with
      schizophrenia and related psychotic conditions and elderly individuals with
      dementia. OBJECTIVE: After examining overall trends in antipsychotic use, this
      analysis reviews patterns of atypical antipsychotic use in the elderly and
      financially disadvantaged populations of Ontario. It identifies affected
      subpopulations and offers several interpretations of how observed patterns of use
      reflect outpatient prescribing practices. METHODS: This study used drug claims
      data from the Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) program for the years 1992 to 1998. The 
      use of antipsychotic agents was followed for 2 years in a subpopulation of ODB
      participants identified as consistent users of these agents (ie, those with
      evidence of > 1-time use). RESULTS: During the study period, the total number of 
      ODB claimants grew by 1%, the number of claimants using antipsychotic agents
      increased by approximately 25%, and the expenditure per claimant in this group
      increased by nearly 250%. Much of this growth in expenditures was associated with
      use of the newer atypical antipsychotic agents olanzapine, risperidone, and
      quetiapine. Compared with patients aged > or = 65 years, those aged < 65 years
      were more likely to receive an initial prescription for an atypical antipsychotic
      or be switched to an atypical antipsychotic. However, the proportion of patients 
      aged > 85 years consistently using antipsychotic agents was greater than
      predicted based on the proportion of the ODB population they represent. These
      patients were more likely to use conventional antipsychotic agents exclusively.
      CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the atypical antipsychotic agents was paralleled
      by a striking increase in ODB expenditures for antipsychotic drugs, although use 
      of these agents was not consistent across age groups. There was more switching to
      atypical antipsychotics, as well as greater use in general, among younger
      compared with older patients, despite evidence that the atypical antipsychotics
      may be safer in the elderly than conventional antipsychotics. Guideline
      dissemination may be an important way of familiarizing clinicians with the
      atypical agents. Health care systems should be aware of the potential for a
      substantial increase in health care costs with more widespread adoption of these 
      medications.

TI  - Severe ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death on neuroleptics.
PG  - 146-50
AB  - (1) Neuroleptics prolong the QT interval, with a risk of torsades de pointes,
      ventricular tachycardia, syncope and sudden death. This adverse reaction is
      dose-dependent. (2) Most published cases have involved phenothiazines, and
      especially thioridazine. Most other neuroleptics have also been involved,
      including recent drugs such as risperidone and olanzapine. 'Hidden neuroleptics' 
      such as cisapride and injectable domperidone carry the same risk. (3) While this 
      effect has been known for several decades, the degree of risk associated with the
      various neuroleptics is still poorly known, and few epidemiological data are
      available. (4) The cornerstones of prevention of cardiac arrhythmia in patients
      treated with neuroleptics are to weigh up carefully the indications, prescribe
      the lowest effective dose, and monitor the ECG. All patients should also be
      screened for precipitating factors, such as other risk factors for torsades de
      pointes and combination with other drugs that favour torsades de pointes or
      provoke pharmacokinetic interactions.

TI  - New drugs with novel therapeutic characteristics. Have they been subject to
      randomized controlled trials?
PG  - 1487-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine how many randomized controlled trials on the safety or
      efficacy of new drugs are published when these drugs are first marketed in
      Canada, and to determine the quality of the information in those trials. DESIGN: 
      A MEDLINE search was conducted on each drug identified as having novel
      therapeutic characteristics and first marketed between 1990 and 2000. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of trials dealing with the safety or efficacy of each
      drug published at the time the drug was marketed. Number of patients taking the
      study drug, length of the trial, and type of control. RESULTS: The number of
      trials varied substantially. For some drugs, there were more than 20 studies; for
      others only a single study. Many trials were small and short-term, and used
      placebo controls. CONCLUSION: Too few trials or inadequate trials on the safety
      and efficacy of new drugs are published when these drugs are first marketed in
      Canada. The lack of published trials means that physicians do not know whether
      results are generalizable to their patients, how to position the drug in relation
      to other treatments, or whether the drugs have long-term safety and efficacy.

TI  - Maintenance therapy in schizophrenia: a critical comment.
PG  - 277-81
AB  - The paper's aim was to evaluate a rationale for maintenance therapy in
      schizophrenia and to consider the feasibility of intermittent targeted therapy as
      an alternative treatment strategy. This was achieved by a selected review of the 
      relevant English-language literature published since 1966 through a Medline
      search and cross-referencing. Current scientific evidence for continuous
      maintenance therapy in schizophrenia was found equivocal as the randomization in 
      clinical trials lumped together heterogeneous groups of patients, thereby
      creating a wide gap between research and clinical practice. In addition, the
      majority of studies took a narrow view of the concept of relapse. For these
      reasons, targeted intermittent treatment was probably prematurely discarded
      altogether. The rationale for use and optimal duration of maintenance
      antipsychotic pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia has not been adequately
      validated. The construct validity of outcome indicators currently used in
      maintenance treatment studies in schizophrenia should be reconsidered.
      Intermittent targeted treatment may represent a viable option in some clinical
      situations and warrant further evaluation. With the widespread use of atypical
      antipsychotics, current long-term maintenance strategies may need a reappraisal.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of interventions designed to reduce the risk of
      progression to first-episode psychosis in a clinical sample with subthreshold
      symptoms.
PG  - 921-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most disability produced by psychotic illnesses, especially
      schizophrenia, develops during the prepsychotic period, creating a case for
      intervention during this period. However, only recently has it been possible to
      engage people in treatment during this phase. METHODS: A randomized controlled
      trial compared 2 interventions in 59 patients at incipient risk of progression to
      first-episode psychosis. We termed this group ultra-high risk to emphasize the
      enhanced risk vs conventional genetic high-risk studies. Needs-based intervention
      was compared with specific preventive intervention comprising low-dose
      risperidone therapy (mean dosage, 1.3 mg/d) and cognitive behavior therapy.
      Treatment was provided for 6 months, after which all patients were offered
      ongoing needs-based intervention. Assessments were performed at baseline, 6
      months, and 12 months. RESULTS: By the end of treatment, 10 of 28 people who
      received needs-based intervention progressed to first-episode psychosis vs 3 of
      31 from the specific preventive intervention group (P=.03). After 6-month
      follow-up, another 3 people in the specific preventive intervention group became 
      psychotic, and with intention-to-treat analysis, the difference was no longer
      significant (P=.24). However, for risperidone therapy-adherent patients in the
      specific preventive intervention group, protection against progression extended
      for 6 months after cessation of risperidone use. CONCLUSIONS: More specific
      pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy reduces the risk of early transition to
      psychosis in young people at ultra-high risk, although their relative
      contributions could not be determined. This represents at least delay in onset
      (prevalence reduction), and possibly some reduction in incidence.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of aripiprazole and haloperidol versus placebo in patients
      with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 763-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aripiprazole is an investigational agent for treating schizophrenia
      that has a novel pharmacologic profile. The present study investigated the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole and haloperidol compared with 
      placebo. METHOD: A 4-week, double-blind, randomized study, conducted at 36 U.S.
      centers between July 1997 and June 1998, compared aripiprazole (15 mg/day, 30
      mg/day) to placebo, with haloperidol (10 mg/day) as an active control. Fixed
      doses of each agent were administered from day 1 throughout the study. A total of
      414 patients with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
      disorder were randomized. Efficacy measures included the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, PANSS positive, PANSS negative, PANSS-derived Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) core, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Severity 
      of Illness, and mean CGI-Improvement scores. Safety and tolerability evaluations 
      included extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), weight gain, serum prolactin level, and
      QTc interval. RESULTS: Both doses of aripiprazole and haloperidol, 10 mg,
      produced statistically significant (p < or = .05) improvements from baseline in
      PANSS total, PANSS positive, PANSS-derived BPRS core, and CGI-Severity scores and
      significantly lower CGI-Improvement scores at endpoint, compared with placebo.
      Aripiprazole, 15 mg, and haloperidol, 10 mg, significantly improved PANSS
      negative score compared with placebo. Both aripiprazole doses and haloperidol
      separated from placebo for PANSS total scores at week 2. Unlike haloperidol,
      aripiprazole was not associated with significant EPS or prolactin elevation at
      endpoint compared with placebo. There were no statistically significant
      differences in mean changes in body weight across the treatment groups versus
      placebo, and no patients receiving aripiprazole experienced clinically
      significant increases in QTc interval. CONCLUSION: Aripiprazole, effective
      against positive and negative symptoms, is a safe and well-tolerated potential
      treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

TI  - Olanzapine treatment for dopaminergic-induced hallucinations.
PG  - 1031-5
AB  - Atypical antipsychotic medications with lower affinities for D2 receptors are
      considered useful alternatives to treat drug-induced hallucinations in
      Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      unforced titration, parallel design study (2:1 drug to placebo randomization
      ratio) using olanzapine (2.5-10 mg/day to effect) in 30 PD patients with
      drug-induced hallucinations. We performed an extensive battery of
      neuropsychological tests, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS),
      assessments of on and off time at baseline and at 9 weeks after starting the
      medication. Sixteen patients on olanzapine (mean dose, 4.6 mg/night) and 11 on
      placebo completed the study. Compared with placebo, performance on the UPDRS item
      2 (thought disorder), and a structured interview for hallucinations, both tended 
      to improve on drug but neither reached statistical significance. A
      neuropsychological test battery did not show any significant differences. Total
      on UPDRS motor scores (P < 0.05) and timed tapping (P < 0.01) worsened while on
      drug compared to placebo. Bradykinesia (P < 0.01) and gait (P < 0.001) items on
      the UPDRS largely accounted for this deterioration. After completion of the
      study, 8 of 16 patients randomly assigned to drug continued olanzapine at a mean 
      dose of 2.4 mg/day. However, at the last recorded visit only 5 of 24 (20.8%) of
      all patients exposed to drug (including those originally randomly assigned to
      placebo) remained on olanzapine. In patients with PD, low-dose olanzapine did not
      significantly improve hallucinations but did worsen motor function.

TI  - Risperidone decreases craving and relapses in individuals with schizophrenia and 
      cocaine dependence.
PG  - 671-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of atypical neuroleptics for decreasing
      craving and drug relapses during protracted withdrawal in individuals dually
      diagnosed with schizophrenia and cocaine dependence. METHOD: We conducted a
      6-week, open-label pilot study comparing risperidone with typical neuroleptics in
      a sample of withdrawn cocaine-dependent schizophrenia patients. RESULTS:
      Preliminary results suggest that individuals treated with risperidone had
      significantly less cue-elicited craving and substance abuse relapses at study
      completion. Further, they showed a trend toward a greater reduction in negative
      and global symptoms of schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: Atypical neuroleptics may help 
      reduce craving and relapses in this population. Future research should include
      more rigorous double-blind placebo-controlled studies with this class of
      medications.

TI  - Fluvoxamine augmentation of olanzapine in chronic schizophrenia: pharmacokinetic 
      interactions and clinical effects.
PG  - 502-6
AB  - Olanzapine is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) 1A2. In this study,
      pharmacokinetic interactions and clinical effects of adding the CYP1A2 inhibitor 
      fluvoxamine to steady-state olanzapine was examined in patients suffering from
      schizophrenia. Eight patients had been treated for at least 3 months with 10 to
      20 mg/day olanzapine. Fluvoxamine (100 mg/day) was added (week 0) to the
      olanzapine treatment and continued for 8 weeks. Concentrations of olanzapine and 
      its metabolite N-desmethylolanzapine and of fluvoxamine were analyzed at weeks 0,
      1, 4, and 8. Addition of fluvoxamine resulted in a 12% to 112% ( < 0.01) increase
      of olanzapine from 31 +/- SD 15 ng/mL (week 0) to 56 +/- 31 ng/mL (week 8) in all
      patients. N-desmethylolanzapine concentrations were not significantly changed ( >
      0.05). Fluvoxamine concentrations were 48 +/- 26 ng/mL on week 1 and 83 +/- 47
      ng/mL on week 8. It is concluded that fluvoxamine affects olanzapine degradation 
      and thus increases olanzapine concentrations. Although the combination was well
      tolerated in this sample and the negative symptom response appeared to be
      favorable in at least five patients, the combination therapy of olanzapine and
      fluvoxamine should be used cautiously and should be controlled by therapeutic
      drug monitoring to avoid olanzapine-induced side effects or intoxications.

TI  - Pharmacogenomics in schizophrenia: the quest for individualized therapy.
PG  - 2517-30
AB  - There is strong evidence to suggest that genetic variation plays an important
      role in inter-individual differences in medication response and toxicity. The
      rapidly evolving disciplines of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics seek to
      uncover this genetic variation in order to predict treatment outcomes. The goal
      is to be able to select the drugs with the greatest likelihood of benefit and the
      least likelihood of harm in individual patients, based on their genetic
      make-up-individualized therapy. Pharmacogenomic studies utilize genomic
      technologies to identify chromosomal areas of interest and novel putative drug
      targets, while pharmacogenetic strategies rely on studying sequence variations in
      candidate genes suspected of affecting drug response or toxicity. The candidate
      gene variants that affect function of the gene or its protein product have the
      highest priority for investigation. This review will provide demonstrative
      examples of functional candidate gene variants studied in a variety of
      antipsychotic response phenotypes in the treatment of schizophrenia. Serotonin
      and dopamine receptor gene variants in clozapine response will be examined, and
      in the process the need for sub-phenotypes will be pointed out. Our recent
      pharmacogenetic studies of the subphenotype of neurocognitive functioning
      following clozapine treatment and the dopamine D(1) receptor gene (DRD1) will be 
      presented, highlighting our novel neuroimaging data via
      [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) metabolism position emission tomography
      (PET) that demonstrates hypofunctioning of several brain regions in patients with
      specific dopamine D(1) genotype. Preliminary candidate gene studies investigating
      the side-effect of clozapine-induced weight gain are also presented. The
      antipsychotic adverse reaction of tardive dyskinesia and its association with the
      dopamine D(3) receptor will be critically examined, as well as the added
      influence of antipsychotic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 1A2 gene (CYP1A2 ).
      Results that delineate the putative gene-gene interaction between DRD3 and CYP1A2
      are also presented. We have also utilized FDG-PET subphenotyping to demonstrate
      increased brain region activity in patients who have the dopamine D(3) genotype
      that confers increased risk for antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia. The
      merits and weaknesses of neuroimaging technologies as applied to pharmacogenetic 
      analyses are discussed. To the extent that the above data become more widely
      verified and replicated, the field of psychiatry will move closer to clinically
      meaningful tests that will be useful in deciding the best drug for each
      individual patient.

TI  - A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the discontinuation of long-term
      antipsychotics in dementia.
PG  - 197-210
AB  - The objectives of this randomized clinical trial were to investigate the impact
      of the discontinuation of long-term antipsychotics in residents with dementia in 
      chronic care institutions and to identify clinical predictors of safe
      discontinuation. Subjects included 34 residents with dementia who were on
      antipsychotics for more than 6 months and whose behavior was currently stable.
      Subjects were randomized to either continue receiving their regular dosage of
      antipsychotics or to receive placebo for 6 months. Early withdrawal from the
      study was not statistically different between the groups (relative risk [RR] =
      1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-3.26), and though not significantly
      different, subjects in the placebo group were more likely to be withdrawn from
      the study because of worsening behavior (RR = 1.25, 95% Cl 0.33-4.76). Three
      subjects in the placebo group were withdrawn from the study due to worsening of
      extrapyramidal symptoms. The active treatment group had more behavioral problems 
      (e.g., physical aggression towards others, p < .05) compared to the placebo
      group. The placebo group developed more apathy, but balancing this outcome was a 
      relative improvement in cognitive functioning. Baseline antipsychotic dose was
      predictive of behavioral worsening upon discontinuation of long-term
      antipsychotic drugs. The primary limitation of the study was the small sample
      size. In conclusion, a trial of discontinuation of antipsychotics should be
      considered in this population.

TI  - Olanzapine in the treatment of dopamimetic-induced psychosis in patients with
      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 438-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies in elderly patients demonstrate antipsychotic efficacy and
      favorable safety profiles for olanzapine. We report results from two
      placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of olanzapine for treatment of
      dopamimetic drug-induced psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
      METHODS: Patients were treated with olanzapine or placebo for 4 weeks while
      dopamimetic therapy was held constant. Olanzapine was initiated at 2.5 mg/day,
      with 2.5-mg/day increases allowed every 3 to 4 days up to the maximum dose of 15 
      mg/day. RESULTS: Olanzapine patients showed significant improvements from
      baseline on positive symptoms and most efficacy measures, but no significant
      treatment-group differences were observed. Olanzapine performed significantly
      worse than placebo in both studies on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
      Scale (UPDRS) total, Motor, and Activities of Daily Living scales, but not the
      UPDRS Tremor item or Complications scores. Corrected QT interval, vital signs,
      and body weight were not significantly different from placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings did not demonstrate superior efficacy of olanzapine for treatment of
      dopamimetic-induced psychosis in PD. The initial dose-titration schedule and mild
      baseline levels of psychosis may account for these findings. Future studies
      involving gradual dose titration are needed to explore further olanzapine's
      optimum use for patients with PD with treatment-related psychosis.

TI  - One-year outcome in first episode psychosis patients in the Swedish Parachute
      project.
PG  - 276-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Implementing a system designed to treat first episode psychotic (FEP) 
      patients. METHOD: Every FEP patient (n=253) from a catchment area of 1.5 million 
      inhabitants were asked to participate in this 5-year project. One historical
      (n=71) and one prospective (n=64) FEP group were used for comparisons. RESULTS: A
      total of 175 patients (69%) were followed up through the first year of treatment.
      Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) values were significantly higher than in
      the historical comparison group but similar to the prospective group. Psychiatric
      in-patient care was lower as was prescription of neuroleptic medication.
      Satisfaction with care was generally high in the Parachute group. Access to a
      small overnight crisis home was associated with higher GAF. CONCLUSION: It is
      possible to successfully treat FEP patients with fewer in-patient days and less
      neuroleptic medication than is usually recommended, when combined with intensive 
      psychosocial treatment and support.

TI  - The Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale (MES) in clinical trials of therapies in
      depressive disorders: a 20-year review of its use as outcome measure.
PG  - 252-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Bech-Rafaelsen
      Melancholia Scale (MES) by reviewing clinical trials in which it has been used as
      outcome measure. METHOD: The psychometric analysis included internal validity
      (total scores being a sufficient statistic), interobserver reliability, and
      external validity (responsiveness in short-term trials and relapse prevention in 
      long-term trials). RESULTS: The results showed that the MES is a unidimensional
      scale, indicating that the total score is a sufficient statistic. The
      interobserver reliability of the MES has been found adequate both in unipolar and
      bipolar depression. External validity including both relapse, response and
      recurrence indicated that the MES has a high responsiveness and sensitivity.
      CONCLUSION: The MES has been found a valid and reliable scale for the measurement
      of changes in depressive states during short-term as well as long-term treatment.

PG  - 221-6
AB  - We used L-(quinoxalin-6-ylcarbonyl)piperidine (CX516) (a modulator of the
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor) as a
      sole agent in a double blind placebo-controlled design in a small series of
      patients with schizophrenia who were partially refractory to treatment with
      traditional neuroleptics. The study entailed weekly increments in doses of CX516,
      from 300 mg tid for week 1 up to 900 mg tid on week 4. Patients were followed
      with clinical ratings, neuropsychological testing, and were monitored for adverse
      events. Four patients received 2 to 4 weeks of CX516, two received placebo and
      two withdrew during the placebo phase. Adverse events associated with drug
      administration were transient and included leukopenia in one patient and
      elevation in liver enzymes in another. No clear improvement in psychosis or in
      cognition was observed over the course of the study. CX516 at the doses tested
      did not appear to yield dramatic effects as a sole agent, but inference from this
      study is limited.

TI  - Switching from conventional to novel antipsychotic drugs: results of a
      prospective naturalistic study.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the long-term consequences of switching patients from
      conventional to novel antipsychotic drugs, from a patient's perspective. METHODS:
      In a prospective, single-blinded, naturalistic study, a cohort of subjects
      (n=150) with schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder (DSM-IV) were switched
      from conventional neuroleptic drugs to either risperidone (n=50), olanzepine
      (n=50) or quetiapine (n=50), and monitored for a period of 2 to 6 years. The
      ensuing natural history of transitions in treatments was charted, and the
      outcomes including symptoms, side effects, subjective tolerability of drugs and
      their impact on quality of life were documented with standardized rating scales. 
      RESULTS: Majority (85%) of the subjects benefited from a switch to the novel
      antipsychotic drugs, though some preferred to return to their original
      neuroleptic (8%), and others eventually required clozapine (7%) therapy. Novel
      antipsychotic drugs were significantly tolerated better, and had a positive
      impact on treatment-adherence, psychosocial functioning and quality of life.
      Among the novel drugs, risperidone was significantly better in improving negative
      symptoms, while olanzepine was particularly well tolerated and effective against 
      comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. Patients treated with quetiapine
      reported fewer side effects, and showed a significantly greater improvement in
      neurocognitive deficits. CONCLUSION: Novel antipsychotics emerged as the drug of 
      choice in view of their overall effectiveness, though conventional neuroleptics
      and clozapine will continue to have a limited but distinct role in the management
      of schizophrenia. The challenge for clinicians lies in matching a patient's
      clinical and biochemical profile with that of a drug's pharmacological actions,
      in order to achieve optimum outcomes.

      multicentre, open study in Spain.
PG  - 15-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of open studies and preliminary results of unpublished
      double-blind trials have suggested that the novel antipsychotic risperidone may
      be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acute mania in bipolar
      disorder. METHODS: A total of 174 patients entered this large, open, multicentre 
      trial. Inclusion criteria were: current manic, hypomanic or mixed episode
      (DSM-IV), and a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score of >7. Assessments included
      the YMRS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Rating Scale for
      Depression (HAM-D), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and Udvalg for Kliniske
      Undersogelser (UKU) subscale for neurological side effects. RESULTS: There were
      significant reductions (P<0.0001) on the YMRS, PANSS and HAM-D scores and a
      significant improvement (P<0.0001) in CGI ratings at the endpoint. There were no 
      statistically significant increments in the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms
      according to the UKU. Risperidone was generally well tolerated. The mean dose of 
      risperidone at the endpoint was 4.9+/-2.9 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL
      IMPLICATIONS: This open study provides further evidence that risperidone is safe 
      and effective in combination with mood stabilisers in the manic phase of bipolar 
      disorder. LIMITATIONS: The open design and the use of concomitant medications
      make unclear to what extent the positive results were entirely related to
      risperidone.

TI  - Optimal dosing of atypical antipsychotics in adults: a review of the current
      evidence.
PG  - 280-91
AB  - This review describes dosing strategies used to optimize the beneficial effects
      of atypical antipsychotic medications. Differences between manufacturers'
      recommended dosing and actual clinical practice are reconciled using evidence
      from pivotal double-blind randomized registration studies, other randomized
      clinical trials, case series, and case reports. With clozapine and perhaps
      olanzapine, plasma levels are correlated with therapeutic response; with
      risperidone, plasma levels are not correlated with therapeutic response but may
      be related to the occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms. Information related to
      optimal dosing of quetiapine and ziprasidone is more limited. In clinical
      practice, the mean daily dose of risperidone has decreased, whereas that for
      olanzapine is increasing. The percentage of patients receiving quetiapine at
      doses above the manufacturer's recommended maximum is higher than would be
      expected, further illustrating that dosing ranges established during registration
      studies may not reflect the needs of day-to-day practice.

TI  - Evidence from a population pharmacokinetics analysis for a major effect of CYP1A2
      activity on inter- and intraindividual variations of clozapine clearance.
PG  - 699-703
AB  - Interindividual variations of clozapine clearance could be related to individual 
      CYP1A2 activity. A population approach was used to investigate clozapine
      pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of clozapine in patients. Clozapine plasma
      concentrations were obtained in 23 patients from therapeutic drug monitoring (83 
      samples). CYP1A2 activity was estimated by the norclozapine/clozapine plasma
      levels ratio and data were processed by a nonlinear mixed-effect modelling
      method. Different covariates (age, body weight, height, CYP1A2 activity, daily
      dose of clozapine) were tested but CYP1A2 activity was the single parameter that 
      improved significantly the predictive model. The best fit was obtained by
      integration of a linear relationship between clozapine clearance and CYP1A2
      activity. The findings suggest that (i) CYP1A2 activity is a major factor that
      determines clozapine clearance and (ii) the norclozapine/clozapine ratio could
      constitute a valuable measure of the CYP1A2 activity. This ratio can be simply
      determined in the context of therapeutic drug monitoring and could explain the
      inter- and intraindividual variation of clozapine plasma levels.

      (ZEUS) study.
PG  - 207-15
AB  - We evaluated relapse in patients with stable, chronic schizophrenia over a 1-year
      period; inpatients were randomized to ziprasidone 40 mg/day (n = 72), 80 mg/day
      (n = 68), 160 mg/day (n = 67) or placebo (n = 71). The probability of relapse
      (Kaplan-Meier) at 1 year was significantly lower in the ziprasidone 40, 80, and
      160 mg/day groups (43%, 35% and 36%, respectively) compared to placebo (77%; P = 
      0.002, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In those patients who remained on 
      treatment for at least 6 months, only 9% subsequently relapsed on ziprasidone
      compared to 42% on placebo (P = 0.001). All three doses of ziprasidone were
      significantly superior to placebo on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      efficacy variables (all P < 0.05). Ziprasidone was associated with a
      significantly greater mean improvement in the PANSS negative symptom subscale
      compared to placebo (P < 0.05). Discontinuation due to adverse events was similar
      with ziprasidone and placebo. Ziprasidone treatment was indistinguishable from
      placebo in assessments of movement disorders and was not associated with weight
      gain or cardiovascular abnormalities. These results demonstrate that ziprasidone 
      was effective in reducing the frequency of relapse and was associated with
      long-term improvement in negative symptoms. Ziprasidone was well tolerated in
      this population of patients with chronic, stable schizophrenia.

      study.
PG  - 243
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the association between olanzapine and diabetes. DESIGN:
      Population based nested case-control study. SETTING: United Kingdom based General
      Practice Research Database comprising 3.5 million patients followed between 1987 
      and 2000. PARTICIPANTS: 19 637 patients who had been diagnosed as having and
      treated for schizophrenia. 451 incident cases of diabetes were matched with 2696 
      controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. RESULTS:
      Patients taking olanzapine had a significantly increased risk of developing
      diabetes than non-users of antipsychotics (odds ratio 5.8, 95% confidence
      interval 2.0 to 16.7) and those taking conventional antipsychotics (4.2, 1.5 to
      12.2). Patients taking risperidone had a non-significant increased risk of
      developing diabetes than non-users of antipsychotics (2.2, 0.9 to 5.2) and those 
      taking conventional antipsychotics (1.6, 0.7 to 3.8). CONCLUSION: Olanzapine is
      associated with a clinically important and significant increased risk of
      diabetes.

TI  - Spotlight on ziprasidone in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 645-52
AB  - Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic agent with a pharmacological profile
      distinct from that of other currently available novel or classical
      antipsychotics. In preclinical studies, ziprasidone was predicted to have
      efficacy against positive, negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia with 
      a favourable tolerability profile, including a low propensity to induce
      extrapyramidal adverse effects. The drug has been administered orally to >300
      patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder 
      in published 4- to 6-week randomised, double-blind trials. When given twice daily
      at dosages of between 80 and 160 mg/day, ziprasidone produced significantly
      greater improvements in overall symptomatology than placebo. In the largest
      study, ziprasidone 80 or 160 mg/day was also significantly more effective than
      placebo in reducing negative symptoms and, at 160 mg/day, was significantly more 
      effective than placebo in improving depressive symptoms in patients with
      associated clinically significant depression. Data from a 4-week trial indicate
      that ziprasidone 160 mg/day has similar efficacy to haloperidol 15 mg/day.
      Ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day was more effective than placebo with respect to
      prevention of impending relapse and improvement of negative symptoms in 294
      stable patients with chronic schizophrenia who were treated for up to 1 year. In 
      addition, significantly more ziprasidone than haloperidol recipients achieved a
      negative symptom response in a 28-week study involving 301 stable patients with
      chronic or subchronic schizophrenia. In general, oral ziprasidone is well
      tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to placebo.
      Importantly, the drug has a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a
      negligible effect on bodyweight. Ziprasidone is associated with slight
      prolongation of the QTc interval; the clinical significance of this is not yet
      clear. The drug does not appear to be associated with sustained elevation of
      plasma prolactin levels. Preliminary data indicate that long-term oral
      ziprasidone treatment is well tolerated. Ziprasidone is the only novel
      antipsychotic currently available in a rapid-acting intramuscular formulation.
      Short-term treatment with intramuscular ziprasidone was effective and well
      tolerated in patients with acute agitation associated with psychosis. In
      addition, intramuscular ziprasidone reduced agitation scores by a significantly
      greater extent than haloperidol in a study involving patients with acute
      agitation associated with psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Ziprasidone is a promising new 
      antipsychotic that has shown significant efficacy in the oral treatment of
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The drug is well
      tolerated with a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a negligible
      effect on bodyweight. In addition, intramuscular ziprasidone shows efficacy and
      good tolerability in the treatment of acute agitation associated with psychotic
      disorders.

TI  - A naturalistic study of risperidone treatment outcome using prognosis-adjusted
      discharge rates in New York State inpatients.
PG  - 585-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information concerning the effectiveness of newer atypical
      antipsychotics is derived largely from controlled clinical trials of relatively
      short duration. Limited information is available concerning naturalistic outcome 
      of patients selected for clinical treatment with atypical antipsychotics. This
      study evaluates 1-year discharge rates among all patients treated with
      risperidone within the New York State inpatient psychiatric hospital system
      during the calendar years 1994 and 1995 ("period of interest") relative to
      patients treated with all other antipsychotic medications. METHOD: Data from the 
      Integrated Research Database at Nathan Kline Institute (Orangeburg, N.Y.) were
      used. This database maintains complete treatment records for all inpatients
      within the New York State psychiatric inpatient system along with demographic,
      diagnostic, admission, and discharge information. Patients were identified at
      admission or first change in antipsychotic during the period of interest, and
      1-year outcome was determined. RESULTS: 2198 risperidone-treated patients were
      identified versus 3259 treated with other antipsychotics. Length of
      hospitalization prior to treatment initiation was the primary predictor of
      discharge rate for both risperidone and control groups. When adjustment was made 
      for between-group difference in prognosis (dischargeability), patients treated
      with risperidone within 30 days of admission were less likely to be discharged
      than those treated with all other agents (including clozapine), whereas
      risperidone was more effective in patients who had been hospitalized for 90 days 
      or more prior to switch from another antipsychotic to risperidone. CONCLUSION:
      When database information is utilized to evaluate treatment effectiveness,
      adjustment must be made for a priori differences in prognosis or
      dischargeability. With appropriate methodology, database studies may indicate
      which patient groups are most likely to benefit from newer atypical antipsychotic
      agents.

      olanzapine using either a direct switch method or a start-taper switch method.
      METHOD: Asian inpatients and outpatients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (N = 108)
      currently treated with predominantly typical antipsychotics were switched to
      olanzapine (initial dose of 10 mg/day) for 6 weeks. Patients were randomly
      assigned to 1 of 2 groups: the direct switch group (N = 54) received only
      olanzapine, while the start-taper switch group (N = 54) received olanzapine and
      their usual antipsychotic in decreasing doses for the first 2 weeks. A successful
      switch was defined as completing 6 weeks of therapy without worsening of symptoms
      (Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale [CGI-S]) or extrapyramidal
      side effects (Simpson-Angus Scale). Overall efficacy was assessed using the
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and safety was assessed by
      recording adverse events and measuring vital signs. RESULTS: Statistically
      significant (p < .001) improvements from baseline to endpoint occurred in both
      switch groups in the CGI-S score and the PANSS total score and subscores.
      However, no significant differences were observed between the switch groups for
      any efficacy measure. Both techniques had comparable rates of successful
      switching (direct switch, 74.1% vs. start-taper switch, 67.9%). The frequency of 
      treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between switch groups with no
      clinically significant differences in any laboratory value or vital sign. Weight 
      gain occurred in both switch groups (p < .001), but the groups were not
      statistically different from each other. Both switch groups showed statistically 
      significant (p < .01) improvements from baseline to endpoint on the Simpson-Angus
      Scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale. CONCLUSION: Moderately ill Asian patients with 
      schizophrenia may experience a decrease in symptom severity and improvement in
      extrapyramidal symptoms when switched from their current medication to olanzapine
      therapy.

TI  - Clozapine-treated subjects with treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a systematic
      review of experimental and observational studies.
PG  - 189-95
AB  - Randomized clinical trials have limitations because they focus on small samples
      of highly selected patients. Observational studies, which follow large cohorts of
      typical patients receiving pharmacological treatments, should overcome some of
      these trial limitations and provide information that cannot be generated with
      clinical trials. The present study aimed to compare experimental and
      observational studies of clozapine-treated subjects with treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. A systematic review of experimental and observational studies
      evaluating clozapine-treated subjects in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was
      carried out. We identified 50 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Less than 
      one-third of clinical trials enrolled more than 50 patients compared to 44% of
      prospective and nearly 90% of retrospective studies. In addition, 78% of
      prospective and 89% of retrospective observational studies lasted more than 12
      weeks, while the majority of trials lasted less than 8 weeks. Most clinical
      trials defined treatment-resistant schizophrenia according to Kane's criteria,
      while the majority of observational studies adopted implicit criteria. In
      comparison with clinical trials, observational studies provided a higher weighted
      mean rate of clozapine-responders and a lower weighted mean rate of
      clozapine-dropouts. This literature survey suggests that the role of
      observational studies in the evaluation of medicines should be reconsidered. A
      new generation of observational studies should be developed to provide evidence
      on patient outcome in typical settings and under real-world circumstances, and on
      variables which may affect outcome.

TI  - Amisulpride improves depressive symptoms in acute exacerbations of schizophrenia:
      comparison with haloperidol and risperidone.
PG  - 305-10
AB  - The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) anxiety/depression subscore has been
      used to assess affective symptoms in three studies (n = 612) comparing
      amisulpride (400-800 mg/day, n = 339) with haloperidol (15-20 mg/day, n = 160)
      and risperidone (8 mg/day, n = 113) in the treatment of acute exacerbations of
      schizophrenia. At endpoint, the mean improvement in the anxiety/depression
      subscore showed a significant (P = 0.011) difference in favour of amisulpride
      (5.6+/-6.1) compared with haloperidol (4.4+/-5.5) and risperidone (3.7+/-4.7).
      Amisulpride provided a significantly greater improvement compared both to
      haloperidol and risperidone in more severely depressed patients (BPRS
      anxiety/depression subscore > or = 16 at baseline, P = 0.001). This significant
      advantage in favour of amisulpride is seen from the 2nd week of treatment.

TI  - Suicidality in schizophrenia: a review of the evidence for risk factors and
      treatment options.
PG  - 279-83
AB  - Suicide is a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality of schizophrenia,
      accounting for approximately 10% of deaths in these patients. The known risk
      factors for suicide in schizophrenia include prior suicide attempts, substance
      abuse, male sex, onset during first decade of illness, social isolation,
      depression, and feelings of hopelessness. There is significant evidence
      suggesting that clozapine reduces the suicide rate in patients with schizophrenia
      and schizoaffective disorder. Possible factors that lead to a decrease in
      suicidality with clozapine include the following: a direct antidepressant action,
      improved cognitive function and insight, diminished negative symptoms, reduced
      substance abuse, and improved compliance. These effects may converge or lessen
      feelings of hopelessness and more of its converse optimism. The International
      Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT) is a large prospective, 2-year randomized
      trial of the comparative effects of clozapine and olanzapine involving 980
      patients at high risk for suicide in 11 countries in 56 sites. The study included
      complete freedom to augment these treatments if needed, blinded ratings, a
      blinded Suicide Monitoring Board, and equivalent clinical contact. The results
      support the superiority of clozapine over olanzapine to reduce the risk of
      suicidality and suggest its use should be considered for all patients with
      schizophrenia with high risk for suicide.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics of hyperglycemia in
      patients treated with olanzapine. DESIGN: Retrospective, epidemiologic survey of 
      spontaneously reported adverse events related to olanzapine therapy SETTING:
      Government-affiliated drug evaluation center. PATIENTS: Two hundred thirty-seven 
      patients with olanzapine-associated diabetes or hyperglycemia. INTERVENTION: One 
      hundred ninety-six cases from January 1994-May 15, 2001, were identified with the
      United States Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch Drug Surveillance System,
      and 41 cases published through May 15, 2001, were identified with MEDLINE or
      through meeting abstracts. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 237 cases, 188
      were new-onset diabetes, 44 were exacerbations of preexistent disease, and 5
      could not be classified. Mean patient age for newly diagnosed cases was
      40.7+/-12.9 years and male:female ratio was 1.8. Seventy-three percent of all
      cases of hyperglycemia appeared within 6 months of start of olanzapine therapy.
      Eighty patients had metabolic acidosis or ketosis, 41 had glucose levels of 1000 
      mg/dl or greater, and 15 patients died. When olanzapine was discontinued or the
      dosage decreased, 78% of patients had improved glycemic control. Hyperglycemia
      recurred in 8 of 10 cases with rechallenge. CONCLUSIONS: Number of reports,
      temporal relationship to start of olanzapine therapy, relatively young age, and
      improvement on drug withdrawal suggest that olanzapine may precipitate or unmask 
      diabetes in susceptible patients.

TI  - Psychopharmacological treatment of aggression in schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 83-9
AB  - Aggressive behavior is frequently observed in schizophrenic patients. More than
      50 % of all psychiatric patients and 10 % of schizophrenic patients show
      aggressive symptoms varying from threatening behavior and agitation to assault.
      The pharmacological treatment of acute, persisting and repetitive aggression is a
      serious problem for other patients and staff members. Not only is violent
      behavior from mentally ill patients the most detrimental factor in their
      stigmatization, aggression is also a considerable direct source of danger for the
      patients themselves. Based on rather limited evidence, a wide variety of
      medications for the pharmacological treatment of aggression has been recommended:
      typical and atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers,
      beta-blockers and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Most clinical 
      information on treating aggression has been collected for atypical neuroleptics, 
      particularly for clozapine. Several retrospective and open studies indicate its
      efficacy. Treatment duration of 6 months is recommended to induce a stable
      reduction of physical and verbal aggression. Severe side effects have very rarely
      been seen. At the moment, clozapine seems to be the first choice in aggression
      treatment. Within the last few years, about 10 articles were published showing
      that this is the most effective antiaggressive agent in the treatment of
      aggression and agitation in psychiatric patients, independent of psychiatric
      diagnosis. However, clozapine, like all the other substances used, does not have 
      an established indication for the treatment of aggressive symptoms. Noncompliance
      with medication makes it difficult to choose the right preparation for the
      medication: tablets, liquids, intramuscular injections and readily soluble
      "FDDFs" are available. Ethical, juridical and methodological problems prevent
      controlled studies from establishing a reference in the treatment of aggression
      in mentally ill patients. This review summarizes the current discussion and
      publications on the pharmacological treatment of aggression in schizophrenic
      patients of the last 20 years. In addition, we will briefly present studies and
      case reports concerning the treatment of aggression in other psychiatric
      patients.

TI  - A transcranial magnetic stimulation study of the effects of olanzapine and
      risperidone on motor cortical excitability in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 74-81
AB  - RATIONALE: There has been a progressive increase in interest in the functioning
      of the main inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters in the pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia. Limited information is available as to how these neurotransmitters
      are affected by commonly prescribed antipsychotic agents. OBJECTIVES: We
      investigated whether the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone
      differ in their effects on inhibitory and excitatory cortical markers measured
      with transcranial magnetic stimulation. METHODS: Electromyographic recordings
      from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle were made during focal transcranial
      magnetic stimulation to the contralateral motor cortex and during bilateral
      cortical stimulation. Twenty patients on each drug and 22 controls were studied
      with measures of the resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential size,
      post-excitatory silent period duration, cortical inhibition and facilitation to
      paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcallosal inhibition.
      RESULTS: The patient groups differed from the controls in the silent period and
      transcallosal inhibition measures, both of which assess cortical inhibitory
      activity. The two medication groups differed in the magnitude of the resting
      motor threshold and several measures of transcallosal inhibition that reflect the
      spread of inhibitory activity between hemispheres. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
      suggest that olanzapine and risperidone differ subtly in their effects on
      cortical inhibitory mechanisms. Further evaluation is required to establish
      whether these differences may reflect or underlie differences seen between these 
      medications in their clinical profiles, including their effects on cognitive
      symptoms of schizophrenia.

TI  - Low striatal and extra-striatal D2 receptor occupancy during treatment with the
      atypical antipsychotic sertindole.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - RATIONALE: Sertindole is a new atypical antipsychotic drug. Preclinical
      pharmacology suggests that sertindole has a preferential effect on the activity
      of limbic and cortical dopaminergic neurons. Clinical trials have shown
      antipsychotic efficacy and very few extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) with sertindole
      at 20 mg/day. OBJECTIVES: This positron emission tomography (PET) study aimed to 
      measure D(2) receptor occupancy in striatal and extra-striatal regions induced by
      clinically representative doses of sertindole in patients with schizophrenia.
      METHOD: Four stabilized schizophrenic out-patients received sertindole 20 mg/day 
      for 6-8 weeks. PET was performed using [(11)C]raclopride to measure D(2) receptor
      occupancy in the striatum and [(11)C]FLB457 to measure occupancy in the neocortex
      and thalamus, i.e. regions with very low D(2) receptor density. RESULTS: Striatal
      D(2) receptor occupancy was 52-68%. Similar occupancies were found in the
      thalamus, and the temporal and frontal cortices. CONCLUSIONS: Sertindole appears 
      efficacious at a low D(2) receptor occupancy, comparable to that produced by
      clozapine. This finding could explain the low risk of EPS. The functional limbic 
      selectivity of sertindole was not reflected in regional differences in receptor
      occupancy.

TI  - The cost-effectiveness of clozapine: a controlled, population-based, mirror-image
      study.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - A retrospective cohort study, with a mirror-image design, was used to measure
      inpatient service utilization in 63 consecutive patients started on clozapine
      from a geographical catchment area compared to a control group matched for
      previous inpatient service use. An intent-to-treat analysis, including those
      patients (n = 28) who discontinued clozapine during the study period, showed a
      significant reduction in number of admissions and total time spent in hospital in
      the 2 years following clozapine initiation compared to the previous 2 years and
      to the follow-up period in the control group. This translated into a reduction of
      7,300 pounds in hospitalization costs per patient started on clozapine, over the 
      2-year period. In those patients who continued clozapine treatment for the whole 
      of the 2-year period, there was a two-thirds reduction in number of admissions
      and total time spent in hospital compared to no change in the clozapine
      discontinuers. These findings suggest that clozapine is a clinically and
      cost-effective intervention for severe schizophrenia in routine clinical
      settings.

TI  - Effects of risperidone on the peripheral noradrenegic system in patients with
      schizophrenia: a comparison with clozapine and placebo.
PG  - 293-300
AB  - Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that increases plasma
      norepinephrine (NE) levels, but the mechanism behind this effect is unclear. We
      measured arterial plasma levels of NE and other catechols during intravenous
      infusion of tritium-labeled NE (3H-NE) in risperidone-treated patients and
      compared their data with those from patients treated with clozapine or placebo.
      NE levels in risperidone patients were significantly higher than in placebo
      patients, but lower than in clozapine patients. Neither drug, however, had
      significant effect on plasma levels of the main neuronal metabolite of NE,
      dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), suggesting that adrenoceptors blockade alone would 
      not explain the NE findings. The rate of release of endogenous NE into the
      bloodstream (spillover) was elevated in both risperidone and clozapine patients
      in a manner that paralleled their NE levels; the NE clearance in both groups did 
      not differ from placebo. Following 3H-NE infusion in risperidone-treated
      individuals, production of 3H-DHPG was normal, as it was in the clozapine group, 
      suggesting that risperidone does not impede neuronal uptake or intraneuronal
      metabolism of NE by monoamine oxidase. Our data suggest that both risperidone and
      clozapine elevate plasma NE levels via enhanced neurotransmitter spillover, with 
      risperidone producing a smaller effect.

TI  - [What is the interest of Klinefelter's syndrome for (child) psychiatrists?].
PG  - 260-5
AB  - Klinefelter's syndrome (KS) concerns men and is usually characterized by
      tallness, underdeveloped testes and sterility. It is generally due to the 47,XXY 
      genotype, ie one extra X chromosome in each cell. Its estimated frequency among
      newborn boys is 1/500 to 1/700. It seems that 64% KS would be undiagnosed.
      Abnormally low levels of testosterone blood values are very common in this
      syndrome. In this case, replacement androgen therapy should be initiated (ideally
      at the age of 11-15) which prevents osteoporosis and enhances secondary sexual
      features. Case report - Since early childhood, Mr X has been shy, passive with
      few friends. When he was 13 years old, the school physician noted a delay of
      puberty and referred him to an endocrinologist who diagnosed KS. Androgen therapy
      was introduced but rapidly stopped, because the boy and his parents thought it
      was useless. Mr X consulted a psychiatrist at the age of 21. He presented a
      schizo-affective disorder with influence syndrome, auditory and visual
      hallucinations, labile mood with disinhibited and depressive periods. He was
      admitted in a psychiatry ward of a general hospital. An endocrinologist confirmed
      the diagnosis of KS and found very low blood testosterone levels. Besides lithium
      and risperidone which had already been introduced before the hospitalization,
      androgens (testosterone undecanoate) were very progressively given to Mr X with a
      daily psychiatric evaluation. One month after discharge, a major depressive
      episode led to the adjunction of citalopram. After one year of follow-up, Mr X
      shows increased social adjustment and enhanced interest; the influence syndrome
      has partially regressed and his mood is more stable. Discussion - In the years
      '60 and '70, systematic screenings in psychiatric hospitals have detected 1.3% KS
      among hospitalized boys, ie 10 times more than in the general population, and 0.6
      to 1% KS among hospitalized men. A large variety of psychiatric disorders have
      been described. Boys presenting KS are usually described as shy, with little
      energy and initiative, and few friends. They cry more often than compares.
      Neuropsychological studies demonstrate significantly lower verbal IQ than
      controls, while performance IQ is generally normal and global IQ is in the normal
      range with large individual variations. Language acquisition is always delayed.
      However, agressiveness is not increased. In his follow-up study of 20 years,
      Nielsen at al found more psychiatric disorders among KS patients, compared to a
      group of hypogonadal patients at first examination (mean age=27 years). After 20 
      years follow-up, however, no significant difference remained between the two
      cohorts concerning the frequency of psychiatric hospitalizations or mental
      diseases. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain psychological aspects 
      of KS such as low levels of androgens during foetal and child development,
      personality disorder related to hypogonadism, delay of mitosis of cells with an
      extra X chromosome, but none of them is able to explain the specificity of
      psychological problems associated with KS. Concerning therapeutic aspects,
      specialists prone substitutive androgen therapy in case of too low testosterone
      blood levels, from the time of increase in FSH (around the age of 11-15). It
      prevents osteoporosis, backache and excessive tiredness often found in males with
      KS; testosterone also improves social drive, mood, concentration and ability at
      work. If KS diagnosis is made at adult age, androgen therapy has also shown some 
      efficacy, though less than if started earlier. Due to the oral and written
      language problems of KS boys between 5 and 12 years of age, Graham et al.
      recommend anticipatory guidance for these boys. In addition, they insist on the
      importance of the information of the parents, language therapy, the reduction of 
      the length of the instructions given by schoolmasters and specially stimulating
      and stable childhood conditions. Though it is generally thought that androgens
      increase agressiveness, we found no consistent data in litterature proving that
      the restoration of physiological androgen blood levels increases crimes nor
      aggressiveness. In the contrary, Miller and Sulkes described four cases of KS men
      presenting chronic fire-setting behaviors. Testosterone was introduced. For three
      of them, follow-up was available: their behavior seemed improved and none of them
      recurred. However, the initiation of androgen therapy for patients with severe
      psychiatric illness should be done very carefully. Conclusion - The Klinefelter's
      syndrome is frequent and, if not diagnosed (which seems to be the most common
      case), these men have higher risks to develop psychiatric disorders. Therefore,
      child psychiatrists and psychiatrists should evoke that diagnosis when they
      examine boys or men who present typical physical traits of KS (tallness,
      underdevelopped testes) associated to school problems and/or psychiatric
      disorders. Indeed, if the diagnosis is confirmed by an endocrinologist and a
      genetic testing, psychological follow-up and testosterone undecanoate treatment
      (in case of abnormal testosterone blood levels) should be initiated. This therapy
      generally improves physical well-being and improves mood, concentration, capacity
      at work. There is no consistent data in the litterature proving that restoring
      physiological testosterone blood levels would be dangerous for KS men presenting 
      severe psychiatric troubles. However, this should be discussed in each situation 
      with caution, and androgens should be introduced very progressively.

TI  - Combination of a mood stabilizer with risperidone or haloperidol for treatment of
      acute mania: a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of efficacy and
      safety.
PG  - 1146-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study assessed the efficacy and safety of risperidone as an
      adjunctive agent to mood stabilizers in the treatment of acute mania. METHOD:
      This 3-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 156
      bipolar disorder patients with a current manic or mixed episode who received a
      mood stabilizer (lithium or divalproex) and placebo, risperidone, or haloperidol.
      The primary efficacy measure was the Young Mania Rating Scale. Other assessments 
      used the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression scale,
      and safety measures. RESULTS: The trial was discontinued by 25 (49%) of the 51
      placebo group patients, 18 (35%) of the 52 risperidone group patients, and 28
      (53%) of the 53 haloperidol group patients. Mean modal doses were 3.8 mg/day
      (SD=1.8) of risperidone and 6.2 mg/day (SD=2.9) of haloperidol. Significantly
      greater reductions in Young Mania Rating Scale scores at endpoint and over time
      were seen in the risperidone group and in the haloperidol group, compared with
      the placebo group. Young Mania Rating Scale total scores improved with
      risperidone and with haloperidol both in patients with psychotic features and in 
      those without psychotic features at baseline. Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale
      total scores at endpoint were significantly higher in the haloperidol patients
      than in the placebo patients. Antiparkinsonian medications were received by 8%,
      17%, and 38% of patients in the placebo, risperidone, and haloperidol groups,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone plus a mood stabilizer was more
      efficacious than a mood stabilizer alone, and as efficacious as haloperidol plus 
      a mood stabilizer, for the rapid control of manic symptoms and was well
      tolerated.

TI  - Prevalence of obesity, lipid and glucose abnormalities in outpatients prescribed 
      clozapine.
PG  - 119-20
AB  - Individuals with schizophrenia have standardised mortality rates which are double
      that of the general population. In addition to suicide, high rates of
      cardiovascular and respiratory disease contribute to this raised mortality rate. 
      Although clozapine has been reported to improve psychotic symptoms and decrease
      suicide rates, attention has recently focussed on its potential to increase
      cardiovascular risk factors including obesity, dyslipidemia and diabetes

TI  - D-Cycloserine added to risperidone in patients with primary negative symptoms of 
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 19-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: D-Cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine recognition site of
      the NMDA receptor has previously been shown to improve negative symptoms when
      added to conventional antipsychotics and to worsen negative symptoms when added
      to clozapine. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of
      D-cycloserine when added to risperidone on negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
      METHOD: Ten patients with schizophrenia who were treated with risperidone
      completed consecutive two week trials of placebo and four doses of D-cycloserine.
      Clinical assessments were videotaped and were scored by a rater who was blind to 
      temporal sequence. RESULTS: D-Cycloserine at a dose of 50mg/day was associated
      with significant reduction in negative symptoms (mean=10%). Ratings of
      depression, extrapyramidal side effects, and cognitive function were unchanged.
      Serum concentrations of glutamate and serine increased significantly on this dose
      of D-cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that combination
      of D-cycloserine, 50mg/day, with risperidone may improve negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia over a narrow dose range. The degree of improvement appears to be
      intermediate between improvement of negative symptoms observed with combination
      of D-cycloserine with conventional antipsychotics and worsening of negative
      symptoms observed with combination of D-cycloserine with clozapine in previous
      trials of identical design.

TI  - A placebo controlled trial of bupropion for smoking cessation in schizophrenia.
PG  - 53-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenic patients have high rates of cigarette smoking compared 
      with the general population. We compared sustained-release (SR) bupropion with
      placebo for smoking cessation in patients with schizophrenic disorders. We also
      examined how antipsychotic class predicts smoking cessation outcomes with
      bupropion. METHODS: Thirty-two subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia
      or schizoaffective disorder and nicotine dependence were randomized to bupropion 
      SR (BUP, 300 mg/day) or placebo (PLA). Outcomes included treatment retention,
      smoking abstinence rates, expired breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels, psychotic
      symptoms, and medication side effects. RESULTS: Bupropion significantly increased
      trial endpoint 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence rates compared with
      placebo [BUP, 8/16 (50.0%), PLA, 2/16 (12.5%); chi(2) = 5.24, df = 1, p <.05],
      and reduced CO levels during the trial [Medication x Time interaction; Z = 3.09, 
      p <.01]. Positive schizophrenia symptoms were not altered by BUP, but negative
      symptoms were significantly reduced. Atypical antipsychotic drug treatment
      enhanced smoking cessation responses to BUP. Major side effects were dry mouth,
      gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      suggest that 1) BUP enhances smoking abstinence rates compared with PLA in
      nicotine-dependent schizophrenic smokers; 2) BUP is well-tolerated and safe for
      use in these patients; and 3) atypical antipsychotics may enhance smoking
      cessation outcomes with BUP.

TI  - Clinical and economic outcomes associated with olanzapine for the treatment of
      psychotic symptoms in a county mental health population.
PG  - 803-17
AB  - BACKGROUND: The comparatively high acquisition costs of the newer antipsychotic
      medications have caused the mental health community to look closely at their
      potential benefits. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to perform a
      naturalistic analysis of changes in mental health service utilization, economic
      costs, and clinical outcomes after the initiation of olanzapine therapy for
      psychotic symptoms in an indigent patient population from a large county-operated
      mental health care system. METHODS: This was a prospective, uncontrolled
      investigation using a mirror-image cohort design. All captured costs from
      patients who began olanzapine therapy between November 1, 1996, and April 30,
      1998, were analyzed in an intent-to-treat fashion to compare resource utilization
      in the 12 months immediately before and after the intervention. Clinical function
      was assessed at baseline and 6 months using the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale (PANSS). In a subgroup analysis, the baseline characteristics of patients
      who completed 12 months of olanzapine treatment were compared with those of
      patients who (1) changed medication or (2) changed pay or source or were lost to 
      follow-up. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine patients were started on olanzapine
      treatment during the 18-month study entry phase. Patients were primarily male
      (63.5%) and had a mean age of 35.9 years. Most (66.3%) had a formal diagnosis of 
      thought disorder. Fifty-six patients received olanzapine for 12 consecutive
      months, and 22 were switched to other psychotropic medications. Of the remaining 
      111 patients, 70 changed payors (ie, qualified for Medicaid), and 41 were lost to
      follow-up. In the subgroup analysis, patients who completed 12 months of
      treatment (ie, responders) had significantly lower mean PANSS total scores at
      baseline compared with those who changed payors or were lost to follow-up (P =
      0.047), and were significantly more likely to have a formal diagnosis of thought 
      disorder (P = 0.039). Responders demonstrated a significant reduction in PANSS
      total and negative subscale scores at 6-month follow-up (both measures, P <
      0.001). In the intent-to-treat analysis of resource utilization in all patients
      with complete data sets (n = 78), hospitalization costs and crisis costs
      decreased significantly during the 12-month follow-up period (P = 0.003 and P =
      0.009, respectively), and both outpatient and medication costs increased
      significantly (P = 0.035 and P < 0.001, respectively). Overall, the change in
      total annual resource utilization during the 12 months after initiation of
      olanzapine was not statistically significant (mean decrease per patient, $1,991; 
      95% CI, -$5,258 to $1,122). CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of olanzapine therapy was
      associated with favorable clinical outcomes in this population, particularly in
      patients with a formal diagnosis of thought disorder. Overall, there was a cost
      shift away from hospital and crisis costs toward medication and outpatient
      services costs. The decline in total resource utilization was not statistically
      significant, although it may be of practical importance.

TI  - Recent trends in antipsychotic combination therapy of schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder: implications for state mental health policy.
PG  - 75-84
AB  - Little is known about antipsychotic combination therapy, although this practice
      is becoming increasingly common in the treatment of schizophrenia. Medicaid
      pharmaceutical claims for a cohort of 836 New Hampshire beneficiaries with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were followed from 1995 through 1999.
      Use of traditional and atypical antipsychotic medications, antidepressants,
      anxiolytic hypnotics, and mood stabilizers was tracked monthly. The number of
      medications, frequency of coprescription, and Medicaid pharmaceutical costs are
      described. The proportion of individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective
      disorder treated with atypical antipsychotics grew from 43 percent in 1995 to 70 
      percent in 1999. At the same time, concurrent use of two or more antipsychotic
      medications quadrupled, increasing from 5.7 percent to 24.3 percent. Persons with
      schizophrenia were also prescribed more antidepressants (increased from 18.5% in 
      1995 to 35.6% in 1999), anxiolytics (increased from 19.9% to 33.5%), and mood
      stabilizers (increased from 17.7% to 30.0%). The increase in multiple agent
      therapy appears to be broad-based. Data are needed on the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of these practices to inform clinical decision making and
      health policy.

      calls to develop clinical profiles of the new atypical antipsychotic drugs and by
      Mattes's critiques (1997, 1998), we performed two sets of analyses for
      risperidone. First, we reanalyzed data from the North American risperidone trial:
      risperidone was superior to haloperidol to an equal degree in patients with and
      without the deficit syndrome, in patients with paranoid and nonparanoid
      schizophrenia, in treatment-resistant and treatment-responsive patients (patients
      hospitalized for longer and shorter periods), and in patients with or without
      weight gain. Moreover, risperidone was more effective than haloperidol on
      symptoms nonresponsive and responsive to haloperidol; its effects on negative
      symptoms were independent of its effects on extrapyramidal symptoms; and it was
      effective in treating depression in schizophrenia. Second, we performed a
      meta-analysis of 18 controlled risperidone trials: risperidone was consistently
      more effective than conventional antipsychotics in treating positive and negative
      symptoms.

TI  - Phenomenology of and risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus and diabetic
      ketoacidosis associated with atypical antipsychotics: an analysis of 45 published
      cases.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - Case reports and small retrospective studies suggest that atypical antipsychotic 
      agents may be associated with new-onset Type II diabetes mellitus (DM) or
      diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); however, these reports often provide limited or no
      information on demographic variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, relationship
      to weight gain, and time course. We analyzed 45 published cases of new-onset DM
      or DKA for which followed initiation of atypical antipsychotic treatment. Of the 
      45 patients, 20 had received clozapine, 19 olanzapine, 3 quetiapine, and 3
      risperidone. Eighty-seven percent patients were male, and 47% African American.
      Forty-two percent of these patients presented as DKA, and 50% manifested no
      weight gain at time of presentation with DM or DKA, although 84% were overweight 
      before antipsychotic therapy. Eighty-four percent presented within 6 months and
      59% within 3 months of commencing atypical antipsychotics. The DKA cohort had
      significantly younger age, less overweight at baseline, and higher proportion of 
      women than did those with DM alone, without significant differences in
      distribution of ethnicity, weight gain, family history of DM, or duration of
      exposure to atypical agents. Clinicians should be aware of the potential risks of
      new-onset DM and DKA in patients taking atypical antipsychotics, and utilize
      appropriate clinical and laboratory monitoring to prevent serious adverse events.

TI  - Improving outcome in schizophrenia: the potential importance of EPS and
      neuroleptic dysphoria.
PG  - 47-57
AB  - Despite half a century of antipsychotic drug treatment, the outcome of therapy in
      schizophrenia remains disappointing. Relapse, rehospitalization, limited
      fulfilment of social roles, and suicide remain frequent, and the economic costs
      are high. Current relapse rates may be two to three times higher than those that 
      could be achieved with optimal use of therapy. Poor compliance with treatment is 
      considered to be a significant preventable cause of poor outcome and is in turn
      likely to be influenced by the patient's experience of drug treatment. There is
      some evidence that extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), particularly akathisia and
      neuroleptic dysphoria, are associated with poor compliance and poor treatment
      outcome. Atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of EPS than do standard
      antipsychotics. Some (risperidone, olanzapine, and ziprasidone) show evidence of 
      a dose-related increase in EPS, but clozapine and quetiapine have demonstrated a 
      placebo-level incidence of EPS across the dose range. Quetiapine does not require
      the regular blood monitoring mandated for clozapine, and results from a patient
      survey indicate a high degree of patient satisfaction with treatment. While
      further research is needed, it is possible that wider use of medications with low
      EPS and high patient acceptability could promote better compliance and improve
      the outcome of schizophrenia treatment.

      among long-stay state hospital patients.
PG  - 755-7
AB  - The authors studied the efficacy of olanzapine and risperidone among patients
      with treatment-refractory schizophrenia who had been hospitalized for more than
      five years and who were not suitable candidates for a clozapine trial. The
      patients were systematically reassessed and were given olanzapine or risperidone 
      as part of a "second-chance program." The patients in both groups showed
      significant improvement in scores on the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
      after three months. Forty-four percent of the patients in the olanzapine group
      and 43 percent of those in the risperidone group were discharged to supervised
      residences on the basis of their clinical improvement. There is value in
      reassessing long-stay patients who have treatment-refractory schizophrenia and
      giving them systematic trials with new medications that become available.

TI  - Olanzapine-induced weight gain in patients with first-episode schizophrenia: a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study of fluoxetine addition.
PG  - 1058-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since olanzapine-induced weight gain may be attributable to the
      antagonistic activity of olanzapine at the serotonin-2C receptor, the authors
      hypothesized that it might be attenuated by addition of the selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. METHOD: First-episode hospitalized schizophrenia
      patients (N=30) were randomly assigned in an 8-week double-blind study of
      olanzapine, 10 mg/day, coadministered with either fluoxetine, 20 mg/day (N=15),
      or placebo (N=15). RESULTS: The group receiving olanzapine plus fluoxetine showed
      significantly less improvement in positive and disorganized symptom dimensions
      than the group receiving olanzapine plus placebo. The two groups demonstrated
      similar and substantial gradual weight gains. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest 
      that fluoxetine coadministration is clinically ineffective and cannot attenuate
      olanzapine-induced weight gain.

TI  - Beneficial antipsychotic effects of celecoxib add-on therapy compared to
      risperidone alone in schizophrenia.
PG  - 1029-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Abnormalities in the immune system in schizophrenia have been
      described. However, important findings such as high levels of activating
      cytokines in the CSF and signs of CNS inflammation have been controversial. The
      authors conducted a trial of the new selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor
      celecoxib, an immunomodulatory drug, in schizophrenic patients to evaluate its
      therapeutic effects. METHOD: In a prospective, double-blind evaluation, 50
      patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were randomly assigned to
      either risperidone plus celecoxib or risperidone plus placebo. After a washout
      period, 25 patients received 2-6 mg/day of risperidone plus placebo and 25
      received risperidone plus 400 mg/day of celecoxib for 5 weeks. The treatment
      effect was calculated by analysis of covariance. There were no significant
      differences between groups in age, sex, duration or severity of disease or
      psychopathology, or risperidone dose or plasma level. RESULTS: Over 5 weeks, both
      groups of patients showed significant improvement in scores on the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale and on all subscales. However, the celecoxib group showed
      significantly greater improvement in the total score. CONCLUSIONS: Additional
      treatment with celecoxib has significant positive effects on the therapeutic
      action of risperidone with regard to total schizophrenia psychopathology.
      Moreover, the fact that treatment with an immunomodulatory drug showed beneficial
      effects on schizophrenia symptoms indicates that immune dysfunction in
      schizophrenia is not just an epiphenomenon but is related to the pathomechanism
      of the disorder. However, a nonimmunological therapeutic effect of celecoxib
      mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor has to be taken into account.

TI  - Physical consequences of schizophrenia and its treatment: the metabolic syndrome.
PG  - 239-57
AB  - Schizophrenia is a life shortening illness. Unnatural causes and natural causes
      are put forward as reasons for this excess mortality. In terms of the latter, a
      host of different physical disorders occur with increased frequency in
      schizophrenia. When taken together, some of these illnesses such as type 2
      diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorders constitute the Metabolic Syndrome;
      a characteristic phenotype of those with this syndrome is excessive visceral fat 
      distribution. The exact reasons why this particular syndrome occurs in
      schizophrenia is as yet unclear though factors such as life style, poor diet and 
      lack of exercise may contribute to it's development. Alternatively, overactivity 
      of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leading to hypercortisolaemia can also
      result in excessive visceral fat accumulation. This minireview aims to explore
      the potential role of these issues and medication in terms of the increased
      morbidity and mortality observed in schizophrenia.

TI  - Effects of neuroleptic medications on speech disorganization in schizophrenia:
      biasing associative networks towards meaning.
PG  - 1123-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: While some cognitive accounts of disorganized speech, or thought
      disorder, in schizophrenia have emphasized failures in working memory/discourse
      planning or selective attention, we have suggested that thought disorder resides 
      in the semantic system. In this study we assessed the effect of neuroleptic
      medication on thought disorder and semantic processing. METHODS: Seventeen
      patients with schizophrenia were assessed while receiving neuroleptic medications
      and in crossover fashion, placebo. A number of measures were obtained: clinically
      rated thought disorder (using the Thought, Language and Communication Scale);
      working memory letter number span); lexical integrity (naming and receptive
      vocabulary); and, semantic priming of intracategorical word pairs. RESULTS:
      Semantic priming measures improved with neuroleptic medication, as did clinically
      rated thought disorder. No other measure changed significantly. Priming
      selectively covaried with changes in thought disorder. CONCLUSION: Changes in
      spreading semantic activation, measured in a semantic priming paradigm and
      presumably brought about by neuroleptics' influence on dopaminergic
      neuromodulatory systems, might reflect changes in the biases of pre-existing
      associative networks that favour or increase the accessibility of representations
      related by shared features. This study also has implications for the architecture
      of normal language in that a dissociation between the lexical and semantic levels
      was observed, due to the selective compromise of tasks demanding semantic
      processing.

TI  - A retrospective comparison of weight, lipid, and glucose changes between
      risperidone- and olanzapine-treated inpatients: metabolic outcomes after 1 year.
PG  - 425-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic side effects have been increasingly noted during therapy
      with novel antipsychotics, but there is a dearth of comprehensive comparative
      data in this area. The goal of this retrospective study was to examine the
      changes in weight parameters, fasting glucose, and fasting lipids in long-term
      inpatients treated with either risperidone or olanzapine. METHOD: A retrospective
      study was performed by reviewing charts of patients at Oregon State Hospital,
      Salem, who were treated during July and August 1999, comparing metabolic outcomes
      during the first year of therapy with either risperidone or olanzapine. Data were
      analyzed also by age, sex, and concurrent use of lithium or valproate. Included
      for analysis were patients at least 18 years old with baseline weights obtained
      within 3 weeks of drug initiation, and baseline fasting triglycerides,
      cholesterol, and glucose obtained within 3 months prior to drug initiation and at
      1 year of treatment (+/- 4 weeks). The patients meeting these criteria in each
      drug cohort (risperidone, N = 47; olanzapine, N = 47) included 1 patient with
      diagnosed diabetes mellitus prior to onset of treatment. RESULTS: Among those
      patients under 60 years old, olanzapine patients (N = 37) experienced
      significantly greater increases at 1 year in all metabolic parameters than the
      risperidone group (N = 39), except for weight variables: triglycerides +104.8
      mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +31.7 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .037); cholesterol +30.7
      mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +7.2 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .004); glucose +10.8
      mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +0.74 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .030). Patients under 60
      years of age with concurrent use of lithium or valproate were associated with
      greater weight gain in both drug groups, but this difference was statistically
      significant only for the olanzapine cohort. Neither weight change nor use of
      lithium or valproate was associated with increases in glucose or lipids among
      those under 60 years old for either drug. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine therapy is
      associated with significantly greater increases in fasting glucose and lipid
      levels for nongeriatric adult patients than risperidone, and the increases are
      not correlated with changes in weight parameters. Appropriate monitoring of
      fasting glucose and serum lipid levels should be considered during extended
      treatment with atypical antipsychotics.

TI  - Clinical predictors of response to clozapine treatment in ambulatory patients
      with schizophrenia.
PG  - 420-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the advent of new atypical antipsychotics, clozapine remains 
      an important option in the treatment of patients with poor response to
      conventional antipsychotics. Clinicians would be well served if clinical
      characteristics could be identified that predict a favorable response to
      clozapine. A few studies addressing this issue have reported inconsistent
      results. METHOD: The association of clinical characteristics with a sustained
      response was investigated in 37 partially treatment-refractory outpatients with a
      DSM-III-R diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia who had been assigned to clozapine
      treatment in a double-blind, haloperidol-controlled, long-term (29-week) study of
      clozapine. Response was defined as a 20% decrease of the Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale (BPRS) psychosis factor score sustained over 2 consecutive ratings.
      Differences between responders and nonresponders with regard to selected baseline
      variables were analyzed with t tests and chi2 tests. In addition, Cox regression 
      analyses were performed to identify variables that best predicted a response to
      clozapine treatment. RESULTS: Clozapine responders were rated as less severely
      ill, showed a lesser degree of negative symptoms, and demonstrated fewer
      extrapyramidal side effects at baseline as compared with nonresponders. In
      addition, higher BPRS total scores--after controlling for the effects of the
      other variables--were associated with a response. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of
      partially treatment-refractory outpatients, a favorable response to clozapine was
      associated with characteristics describing less severely ill patients. The
      history of patients did not affect their response to clozapine.

TI  - Effects of olanzapine on prolactin levels of female patients with schizophrenia
      treated with risperidone.
PG  - 408-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to prospectively examine the effect of
      switching from risperidone to olanzapine on female schizophrenia patients who
      experienced menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and/or sexual dysfunction.
      METHOD: Twenty female patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia who were taking
      risperidone and were suffering from menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and/or 
      sexual dysfunction were enrolled. Patients were switched from risperidone to
      olanzapine over a 2-week period, then treated with olanzapine for 8 additional
      weeks. The serum prolactin concentrations were examined every 2 weeks. The
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
      (AIMS), Simpson-Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Symptoms (SAS), and questions from
      the Dickson-Glazer Sexual Functioning Scale were administered to evaluate
      efficacy, extrapyramidal side effects, and sexual and reproductive functioning at
      baseline and the endpoint of 10 weeks. RESULTS: Serum prolactin levels decreased 
      significantly (p < .01) following the switch from risperidone to olanzapine.
      Scores of PANSS, AIMS, and SAS at the endpoint were also significantly decreased 
      (p < .01) compared to those of baseline. Patients experienced improvements in
      menstrual functioning and perceptions of sexual side effects. CONCLUSION:
      Olanzapine reversed hyperprolactinemia in risperidone-treated female
      schizophrenic patients. This was associated with a decrease in amenorrhea,
      improved cycle regularity, and a decrease in sexual side effects that the women
      attributed to antipsychotic medication. This study suggests that switching to
      olanzapine is a safe and effective alternative method for patients with
      antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia associated sexual and/or reproductive
      dysfunction. Long-term follow-up studies are warranted, with particular attention
      to the course of sexual and reproductive dysfunction.

TI  - Antipsychotic-induced weight gain and therapeutic response: a differential
      association.
PG  - 244-51
AB  - This study investigated the association between antipsychotic-induced weight gain
      and therapeutic response to haloperidol and three commonly used atypical
      neuroleptic medications in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The
      subjects were 151 patients enrolled in a double-blind experiment with a duration 
      of 14 weeks comparing the therapeutic efficacy of haloperidol (n = 36), clozapine
      (n = 38), olanzapine (n = 38), and risperidone (n = 39). Absolute and relative
      (%) gain in body weight and body mass index (BMI) was determined for the entire
      duration of the double-blind treatment period; therapeutic response was assessed 
      by the total score and the individual subscales of the Positive and Negative
      Symptom Scale. Compared with the pretreatment baseline, results indicated that
      for olanzapine and clozapine, therapeutic response was closely related to an
      absolute and relative gain in weight and to a gain in BMI. No association between
      weight gain and therapeutic response was found for risperidone and haloperidol.
      These findings suggest that patients who are likely to have the maximal benefits 
      of olanzapine or clozapine treatment for symptom alleviation are at the highest
      risk of a clinically significant increase in weight gain.

TI  - Phenylpropanolamine appears not to promote weight loss in patients with
      schizophrenia who have gained weight during clozapine treatment.
PG  - 345-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight gain is a common side effect of clozapine treatment and may
      expose patients to obesity-associated health risks. We proposed that concomitant 
      treatment with an appetite suppressant such as phenylpropanolamine (PPA) would
      lead to a decrease in appetite and therefore loss of weight. METHOD: This was a
      12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PPA, 75 mg/day, in
      outpatients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia (DSM-IV) who were stable on
      clozapine treatment for at least 4 months and had gained > 10% of their baseline 
      body weight since starting clozapine. Patients were evaluated for adverse effects
      and weighed weekly. A Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) assessment, a 
      short dietary quiz, and blood indices were completed monthly. RESULTS: Sixteen
      patients were equally randomly assigned to receive PPA or placebo. The groups did
      not differ in mean age, baseline weight, dose of clozapine, baseline PANSS
      scores, or the percent of weight gained since the start of clozapine. There was
      no significant effect of treatment on weight (t = 0.219, df = 10, p = .831).
      There was no significant change in either the total PANSS scores (t = -0.755, df 
      = 10, p = .468), the positive or negative symptom cluster scores, or any of the
      remaining variables. CONCLUSION: Phenylpropanolamine 75 mg/day was well tolerated
      but was not effective in reversing established weight gain associated with
      clozapine treatment in stable outpatients with schizophrenia.

TI  - A pilot, randomized, open-label trial assessing safety and pharmakokinetic
      parameters of co-administration of rivastigmine with risperidone in dementia
      patients with behavioral disturbances.
PG  - 343-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular
      dementia display, in addition to cognitive impairment, various degrees of
      behavioral disturbances. As the use of cholinesterase inhibitors for the
      treatment of cognitive impairment in dementia becomes widespread, many of these
      patients will be treated concomitantly with cholinesterase inhibitors and with
      anti-psychotic drugs to ameliorate behavioral disturbances. Despite the
      widespread use of this combination in clinical practice, the safety and
      tolerability of such combination therapy has not been evaluated in controlled
      clinical trials. This pilot study examined the effects of addition of risperidone
      0.5-2 mg/day to patients on rivastigmine 3-12 mg/day, and vice versa. METHODS: 65
      patients suffering from AD, 10 from vascular dementia, and 15 from both were
      randomized to open label rivastigmine and risperidone, alone or in combination,
      for 20 weeks. Adverse events caused by co-administration were assessed. RESULTS: 
      No clinically relevant adverse interactions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These
      preliminary results indicate that rivastigmine and risperidone can be safely
      co-administered. Confirmation of these results in large clinical trials studies
      is warranted.

TI  - Supplementing clinic-based skills training with manual-based community support
      sessions: effects on social adjustment of patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 829-37
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although skills training is a validated psychosocial treatment for
      schizophrenia, generalization of the skills to everyday life has not been
      optimal. This study evaluated a behaviorally oriented method of augmenting
      clinic-based skills training in the community with the aim of improving
      opportunities, encouragement, and reinforcement for outpatients to use their
      skills in their natural environment. METHOD: Sixty-three individuals with
      schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 60 weeks of clinic-based skills training 
      alone or of clinic-based skills training supplemented with manual-based
      generalization sessions in the community. Patients were also randomly assigned to
      receive either haloperidol or risperidone. Therapists' fidelity to the manuals
      was measured. Patients' acquisition of the skills from pre- to posttraining was
      evaluated. The primary outcome measures were the Social Adjustment Scale-II and
      the Quality of Life Scale. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of the patients completed
      the trial. Only six participants experienced psychotic exacerbations during the
      trial. There was no evidence of a differential medication effect on social
      functioning. Social functioning improved modestly in both psychosocial conditions
      over time; participants who received augmented skills training in the community
      showed significantly greater and/or quicker improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Given
      judicious and effective antipsychotic medication that limited exacerbations to
      less than 10% during the trial, a wide range of outpatients with schizophrenia
      demonstrated substantial learning of illness management and social skills in the 
      clinic. When clinic-based skills training was augmented by in vivo training and
      consultation, transfer of the skills to everyday life was enhanced. These
      benefits were established regardless of the medications prescribed.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-response comparison of intramuscular
      olanzapine and haloperidol in the treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenia.
PG  - 441-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: An intramuscular (IM) formulation of olanzapine has been developed
      because there are no rapid-acting IM atypical antipsychotic drugs currently
      available in the United States for treating acute agitation in patients with
      schizophrenia. METHODS: Recently hospitalized acutely agitated patients with
      schizophrenia (N = 270) were randomized to receive 1 to 3 IM injections of
      olanzapine (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 mg), haloperidol (7.5 mg), or placebo within
      24 hours. A dose-response relationship for IM olanzapine in the reduction of
      agitation was assessed by measuring the reduction in Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC) scores 2 hours after the first
      injection. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events and with
      extrapyramidal symptom scales and electrocardiograms at 24 hours after the first 
      injection. RESULTS: Olanzapine exhibited a dose-response relationship for
      reduction in agitation (F(1,179)= 14.4; P<.001). Mean PANSS-EC reductions 2 hours
      after the first injection of olanzapine (2.5 mg = -5.5; 5.0 mg = -8.1; 7.5 mg =
      -8.7; 10.0 mg = -9.4) were superior to those with placebo (-2.9; P =.01 vs
      olanzapine at 2.5 mg; P<.001 for each other olanzapine dose) but not with
      haloperidol (-7.5). A dose of 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 mg of olanzapine caused a greater
      reduction in agitation than placebo 30 minutes after the first injection. There
      were no differences between treatment groups for hypotension, the most frequently
      reported adverse event, or for clinically relevant changes in the QTc interval.
      There was a greater incidence of treatment-emergent parkinsonism during treatment
      with IM haloperidol (16.7%) than with 2.5 (P =.03), 5.0 (P =.03), or 7.5 mg (P
      =.01) of IM olanzapine (0%) or with placebo (0%) (P =.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Intramuscular olanzapine at a dose of 2.5 to 10.0 mg per injection exhibits a
      dose-response relationship in the rapid treatment of acute agitation in patients 
      with schizophrenia and demonstrates a favorable safety profile.

TI  - Ziprasidone: the fifth atypical antipsychotic.
PG  - 839-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and
      adverse effects of ziprasidone as a treatment for schizophrenia. DATA SOURCES:
      Information was selected from a MEDLINE search (July 2000-October 2001) of
      English-language medical literature using ziprasidone as the search term. Manual 
      searches of pertinent journal article references, request for medical information
      from Pfizer, and access of the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration were 
      also performed. STUDY SELECTION: All available published information regarding
      the pertinent characteristics of ziprasidone were considered for selection. DATA 
      EXTRACTION: Pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies were selected to provide a
      comprehensive description of these characteristics. Clinical investigations were 
      evaluated for design, sample size, diagnosis, duration, and outcome. Data from
      all investigations were selected by 1 author and reviewed by both authors. DATA
      SYNTHESIS: Ziprasidone is a benzisothiazolyl piperazine-type atypical
      antipsychotic that shares the serotonin(2A)/dopamine(2) (5-HT(2A)/D(2)) profile
      of the available atypical antipsychotics. Ziprasidone has demonstrated in vitro
      activity as a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist and as a very weak inhibitor of serotonin
      and norepinephrine reuptake. These data do not support ziprasidone as being a
      clinically meaningful inhibitor of serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake. Oral
      bioavailability of ziprasidone taken with food is approximately 60%, half-life is
      approximately 6-7 hours, and protein binding is extensive at >99%. Twelve
      metabolites have been identified, yet only 4 of these are considered to be
      primary metabolites. Metabolism of ziprasidone by aldehyde oxidase produces its
      only metabolite with potential pharmacologic activity; CYP3A4 also contributes to
      the metabolism of ziprasidone. Clinical studies support ziprasidone as
      efficacious for the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Daily doses permitted in these
      clinical trials ranged from 40 to 160 mg, but only doses between 120 and 160 mg/d
      have been superior to placebo. Future research efforts should be directed toward 
      refractory schizophrenia, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, affective and
      anxiety symptoms associated with schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. 
      Adverse effect characteristics of ziprasidone commonly include headache, nausea, 
      and somnolence; infrequent effects include extrapyramidal symptoms and weight
      gain. Ziprasidone has been reported to cause an average QTc prolongation of
      approximately 20 msec; there have only been 2 patients (0.06%) reported by the
      manufacturer to have a measured QTc interval >500 msec. CONCLUSIONS: Ziprasidone 
      is a safe and efficacious atypical antipsychotic for the acute management of
      schizophrenia. Efficacy data and most safety data for ziprasidone support its use
      as a first-line treatment for schizophrenia; however, its potential effects on
      ventricular repolarization relegate it to second-line status in patients with
      comorbid cardiovascular risks.

TI  - Antihormonal treatment of paraphilic patients in German forensic psychiatric
      clinics.
PG  - 104-6
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate which antihormonal treatment strategies 
      are used in German forensic psychiatric institutions. Forensic clinics were asked
      about the number of treated patients. Four hundred seventy-four patients were
      committed for sex offences; 12% received either CPA (n = 29) or LHRH- agonists (n
      = 29). Differences in efficacy were small. Several side effects confirm the
      importance of a protocol for minimizing medical complications.

TI  - Use of olanzapine for elderly patients with psychotic disorders: a review.
PG  - 201-13
AB  - The number of elderly persons with psychosis will increase with the increasing
      geriatric population. Olanzapine is one of the newer atypical antipsychotics with
      efficacy for positive and negative symptoms and safer side effect profile
      compared to conventional antipsychotics. The manuscript describes the
      pharmacology, efficacy and tolerability studies, adverse effects and dosing
      considerations in the elderly. Further studies are needed to fully assess the
      efficacy and safety of olanzapine in the elderly. Current research supports a
      role for olanzapine in treating elderly patients with schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.

TI  - Prepulse inhibition of the startle response in risperidone-treated patients:
      comparison with typical antipsychotics.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - Individuals with schizophrenia are known to show deficits in prepulse inhibition 
      (PPI) of the startle response. PPI refers to a response suppression in reaction
      to a strong startling stimulus, if preceded briefly by a weak non-startling
      stimulus and represents a well-established animal model to investigate
      information processing deficits in schizophrenia. This study examined PPI of the 
      startle acoustic response in schizophrenic patients given typical antipsychotics 
      or a second generation atypical antipsychotic, risperidone, using a naturalistic 
      between-subjects design. Two groups of male schizophrenic patients: (i) stable on
      a range of typical antipsychotics (n = 20), and (ii) stable on risperidone (n =
      10) were tested for PPI (prepulse-to-pulse intervals: 30, 60, and 120 ms,
      prepulses 15 dB above the background) of the acoustic startle response, and
      compared with a group of healthy male subjects (n = 20). Patients on typical
      antipsychotics showed significantly less PPI with 30 and 60 ms prepulse trials
      than healthy subjects. Risperidone-treated patients did not differ from healthy
      subjects for PPI with any prepulse trials. Further longitudinal within-subject
      studies are now required to examine whether risperidone is superior to typical
      antipsychotics in improving information processing functions, as assessed by PPI 
      of the acoustic startle response, in treatment-responsive male patients with
      schizophrenia.

TI  - A systematic review of the use of atypical antipsychotics in autism.
PG  - 93-101
AB  - Conventional antipsychotic medication is commonly prescribed to patients with
      autistic spectrum disorder. However, a high incidence of severe adverse reactions
      highlights the need to find more favourable treatments. Atypical antipsychotics
      may combine efficacy in ameliorating some autistic symptoms with a lower
      incidence of some adverse reactions. This article reviews the use of atypical
      antipsychotics in autistic disorder, with particular focus on behaviour,
      cognition and physical well-being. Thirteen studies using risperidone, three
      using olanzapine, one using clozapine, one using amisulpride and one using
      quetiapine were identified. Few firm conclusions can be drawn due to the
      limitations of the studies; however, there is an indication that risperidone may 
      be effective in reducing hyperactivity, aggression and repetitive behaviours,
      often without inducing severe adverse reactions. Olanzapine and clozapine may
      also be effective; however, there is little evidence for using amisulpride or
      quetiapine in this population. Randomized trials are required to clarify the
      effectiveness of these agents.

TI  - [Augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) with atypical
      antipsychotics in the treatment of depression].
PG  - 210-7
AB  - The treatment of severe depression represents a difficult task in the daily
      psychiatric practice. In certain cases, augmentation therapies in order to
      improve the efficacy of SSRIs can be useful. Recently, it has become possible to 
      use atypical antipsychotics for SSRI augmentation. This option adds to the
      existing strategies in the treatment of depression and primary systematic studies
      show encouraging results. In this review, the possibility of a SSRI augmentation 
      by additionally administering risperidone or olanzapine is critically discussed.

TI  - Novel factor-based symptom scores in treatment resistant schizophrenia:
      implications for clinical trials.
PG  - 537-45
AB  - To study the factor structure of symptoms in patients with treatment resistant
      schizophrenia and whether it is altered by treatment, we analyzed ratings on the 
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) from two independent groups of patients
      with treatment resistant schizophrenia. With confirmatory factor analysis of
      pre-clozapine BPRS scores in 1074 patients in an administrative data base, the
      Clozapine Authorization and Monitoring Program (CAMP), we assessed the fit of
      published factor models and developed a better-fitting model. Model fit was
      validated in an independent group of 197 research unit participants. Stability of
      model fit six months post-clozapine was assessed in 834 CAMP patients. A new
      4-factor model (negative symptoms, reality distortion, disorganization, and
      anxiety/depression) had better fit in both data sets than two commonly used
      factor models, and also fit better post-clozapine. We recommend these four factor
      scores as clinical trial outcomes in patients with treatment resistant
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Comparison of rapidly acting intramuscular olanzapine, lorazepam, and placebo: a 
      double-blind, randomized study in acutely agitated patients with dementia.
PG  - 494-504
AB  - This double-blind study investigated the efficacy and safety of rapid-acting
      intramuscular olanzapine in treating agitation associated with Alzheimer's
      disease and/or vascular dementia. At 2 h, olanzapine (5.0 mg, 2.5 mg) and
      lorazepam (1.0 mg) showed significant improvement over placebo on the PANSS
      Excited Component (PANSS-EC) and Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES), and 
      both 5.0 mg olanzapine and lorazepam showed superiority to placebo on the
      Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. At 24 h, both olanzapine groups maintained
      superiority over placebo on the PANSS-EC; lorazepam did not. Olanzapine (5.0 mg) 
      and lorazepam improved ACES scores more than placebo. Simpson-Angus and
      Mini-Mental State Examination scores did not change significantly from baseline. 
      Sedation (ACES > or =8), adverse events, and laboratory analytes were not
      significantly different from placebo for any treatment. No significant
      differences among treatment groups were seen in extrapyramidal symptoms or in
      corrected QT interval at either 2 h or 24 h, and no significant differences among
      treatment groups were seen in vital signs, including orthostasis. Intramuscular
      injection of olanzapine may therefore provide substantial benefit in rapidly
      treating inpatients with acute dementia-related agitation.

TI  - Abnormalities in glucose regulation during antipsychotic treatment of
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 337-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus are more common in
      schizophrenia than in the general population. Glucoregulatory abnormalities have 
      also been associated with the use of antipsychotic medications themselves. While 
      antipsychotics may increase adiposity, which can decrease insulin sensitivity,
      disease- and medication-related differences in glucose regulation might also
      occur independent of differences in adiposity. METHODS: Modified oral glucose
      tolerance tests were performed in schizophrenic patients (n = 48) receiving
      clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or typical antipsychotics, and untreated
      healthy control subjects (n = 31), excluding subjects with diabetes and matching 
      groups for adiposity and age. Plasma was sampled at 0 (fasting), 15, 45, and 75
      minutes after glucose load. RESULTS: Significant time x treatment group
      interactions were detected for plasma glucose (F(12,222) = 4.89, P<.001) and
      insulin (F(12,171) = 2.10, P =.02) levels, with significant effects of treatment 
      group on plasma glucose level at all time points. Olanzapine-treated patients had
      significant (1.0-1.5 SDs) glucose elevations at all time points, in comparison
      with patients receiving typical antipsychotics as well as untreated healthy
      control subjects. Clozapine-treated patients had significant (1.0-1.5 SDs)
      glucose elevations at fasting and 75 minutes after load, again in comparison with
      patients receiving typical antipsychotics and untreated control subjects.
      Risperidone-treated patients had elevations in fasting and postload glucose
      levels, but only in comparison with untreated healthy control subjects. No
      differences in mean plasma glucose level were detected when comparing
      risperidone-treated vs typical antipsychotic-treated patients and when comparing 
      typical antipsychotic-treated patients vs untreated control subjects. CONCLUSION:
      Antipsychotic treatment of nondiabetic patients with schizophrenia can be
      associated with adverse effects on glucose regulation, which can vary in severity
      independent of adiposity and potentially increase long-term cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Racial disparities in antipsychotic prescription patterns for patients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 567-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the extent and type of variation in
      antipsychotic prescription patterns between African American and Caucasian
      patients with schizophrenia. METHOD: Subjects were 2,515 adult Medicaid
      recipients treated for schizophrenia in 1995 with one of four types of
      antipsychotic medication (traditional antipsychotics, clozapine, risperidone, or 
      depot antipsychotics). Prescription and mental health service use data were
      collected from Medicaid claims files for the 12 months following the first filled
      antipsychotic prescription. Patterns of antipsychotic prescription were compared 
      for African American (N=1,538, 61%) and Caucasian (N=977, 39%) subjects. RESULTS:
      African American subjects were significantly younger and more likely to receive
      Supplemental Security Income than were the Caucasian subjects, who received
      mental health services more continuously. African American subjects were less
      likely than Caucasian subjects to receive clozapine (8% versus 15%, respectively)
      and risperidone (25% versus 31%) and more likely to receive depot antipsychotics 
      (26% versus 14%). The likelihood of receiving clozapine or risperidone remained
      significantly different after demographic and service use characteristics were
      controlled. CONCLUSIONS: This study found ethnic disparities in antipsychotic
      prescription patterns among a large number of publicly insured clients treated
      for schizophrenia. Given the rapidly changing pharmacological treatment
      environment, these findings have significant implications for differential
      quality of care for African American patients. Future studies employing client
      and provider characteristics are urgently needed to test alternative explanations
      for ethnic disparities.

TI  - Association of diabetes mellitus with use of atypical neuroleptics in the
      treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 561-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The development of both type I and type II diabetes after initiation
      of some atypical neuroleptics has been reported, primarily in studies involving
      small series of patients. This study used administrative data from a large
      national sample of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia to compare the
      prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients receiving prescriptions for atypical 
      and typical neuroleptics. METHOD: All outpatients with schizophrenia treated with
      typical and atypical neuroleptics over 4 months in 1999 in the Veterans Health
      Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) were included in this
      study. Patients treated with atypical neuroleptics were those who received
      prescriptions for clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine. Patients
      with a diagnosis of diabetes were also identified by using ICD-9 codes in VA
      administrative databases. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus across age groups
      and among patients receiving prescriptions for different atypical neuroleptics
      was examined with multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 38,632
      patients were included in the study: 15,984 (41.4%) received typical neuroleptics
      and 22,648 (58.6%) received any atypical neuroleptic (1,207 [5.3%] received
      clozapine; 10,970 [48.4%], olanzapine; 955 [4.2%], quetiapine; and 9,903 [43.7%],
      risperidone; 387 patients received prescriptions for more than one atypical
      neuroleptic). When the effects of age were controlled, patients who received
      atypical neuroleptics were 9% more likely to have diabetes than those who
      received typical neuroleptics, and the prevalence of diabetes was significantly
      increased for patients who received clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine, but
      not risperidone. However, for patients less than 40 years old, all of the
      atypical neuroleptics were associated with a significantly increased prevalence
      of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: In this large group of patients with schizophrenia,
      receipt of a prescription for atypical neuroleptics was significantly associated 
      with diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Reducing the burden of caring for Alzheimer's disease through the amelioration of
      "delusions of theft" by drug therapy.
PG  - 211-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delusions of theft (delusions involving the theft of possessions) are
      one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric manifestations of Alzheimer's disease
      (AD). OBJECTIVE: The current study investigated the presence and extent of such
      delusions before and after drug treatment in a group of AD patients, and the
      consequent effects on the burden of care on caregivers. METHOD: The study was an 
      open-label cohort design. The delusions studied consisted only of those involving
      theft of possessions. Sixteen AD patients served as subjects in order to assess
      the efficacy of Risperidone administration, in the reduction or elimination of
      these delusions. The caregiver burden was evaluated using the Zarit Caregiver
      Burden Interview (ZBI) before the administration of Risperidone and 12 weeks
      after administration, for cases where delusions of theft were eliminated or
      reduced. RESULTS: The burden of care on caregivers was significantly reduced (p <
      0.001) through the elimination or reduction of delusions of theft. CONCLUSION:
      Delusions of theft are considered to be a major factor in increasing the burden
      of care, and the treatment of these, through appropriate drug therapy, is
      therefore of great importance in the continuation of satisfactory care in the
      home.

TI  - The evolving role of topiramate among other mood stabilizers in the management of
      bipolar disorder.
PG  - 215-32
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Topiramate, a structurally novel anticonvulsant, is being evaluated
      for other neurological conditions such as migraine, neuropathic pain, and
      essential tremor, and also for psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder,
      bulimia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, in
      addition to obesity. This article will focus on the use of topiramate for bipolar
      disorder. METHODS: The pharmacological profile of topiramate is compared to other
      established and putative mood stabilizers, and a rationale for its use in bipolar
      disorder is presented. Data from open clinical trials of topiramate for
      depression, mania, and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder are summarized. Preliminary
      data from one pilot dose-finding, double-blind, random-assignment,
      placebo-controlled, 3-week parallel group study of two doses of topiramate for
      acute bipolar I mania is reported. Safety data regarding topiramate was reviewed.
      Finally, the potential place of this agent in bipolar illness is considered.
      RESULTS: The pharmacological advantages for topiramate are low protein binding,
      minimal hepatic metabolism and mainly unchanged renal excretion, a 24-h
      half-life, and minimal drug interactions. Open clinical studies suggest a 50-65% 
      response for refractory bipolar mania, and a 40-56% response for refractory
      bipolar depression in mainly add-on treatment. Open clinical studies of
      topiramate for rapid-cycling subjects and those for comorbid bulimia, substance
      abuse, post-traumatic stress, migraine, and obesity report effectiveness. The
      primary efficacy endpoint data (change from baseline Y-MRS total scores) of the
      placebo-controlled, random assignment parallel group phase II dose-finding study 
      were not statistically significant. However, once the antidepressant-associated
      manias (28 of the sample, of 97 subjects) were excluded from the controlled
      study, the post-hoc analyses indicated the higher dose (512 mg/day) topiramate
      treatment group showed a statistically significant reduction in endpoint Y-MRS
      change scores as compared to placebo (p < 0.03). Adverse effects of topiramate in
      bipolar subjects include attention, concentration and memory problems, fatigue,
      sedation, transient paraesthesias, nausea, and anorexia. Some subjects experience
      word-finding difficulty. Weight loss may be seen in several topiramate-treated
      subjects with bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Topiramate appears to show promise
      as an addition to the agents available to treat bipolar disorder. More definitive
      controlled data on the efficacy of topiramate in the acute and continuation
      phases as well as for the prophylaxis either as monotherapy or as combination
      treatment of bipolar disorder are ongoing, and the results are awaited.

TI  - The anxiolytic effect of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone compared with
      diazepam in subjects anxious before dental surgery.
PG  - 206-10
AB  - The novel atypical antipsychotic ziprasidone has a pharmacologic profile notable 
      for potent agonism of serotonin (5-HT)1A receptors, antagonism at 5-HT1D
      receptors, and reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine. 5-HT1A receptor agonism, in
      particular, suggests anxiolytic activity, and ziprasidone has shown preliminary
      efficacy in treating the symptoms of anxiety associated with psychotic disorders.
      In this study, the anxiolytic efficacy of ziprasidone was evaluated in
      nonpsychotic subjects who were anxious before undergoing minor dental surgery. We
      compared a single oral dose of 20 mg ziprasidone (N = 30) with that of 10 mg
      diazepam (N = 30) and placebo (N = 30) in a randomized, parallel-group,
      double-blind study. The peak anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone compared with that 
      of placebo was similar to that of diazepam but had a later onset. At 3 hours
      postdose, the anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone was significantly greater than
      that of placebo (p < 0.05) and somewhat greater than that of diazepam. Diazepam
      showed a significantly greater anxiolytic effect than placebo at 1 hour (p <
      0.05) but not at 3 hours. The sedative effect of ziprasidone was never greater
      than that of placebo, whereas that of diazepam was significantly greater than
      that of placebo 1 to 1.5 hours postdose. Ziprasidone was generally well
      tolerated. Only one patient reported treatment-related adverse events (nausea and
      vomiting) and, unlike diazepam, ziprasidone did not cause reductions in blood
      pressure. Dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, akathisia, and postural hypotension 
      were not seen with ziprasidone. Thus, ziprasidone may possess anxiolytic effects 
      in addition to its antipsychotic properties.

      the antipsychotic quetiapine.
PG  - 174-82
AB  - The effects of fluoxetine and imipramine on the pharmacokinetics and
      nonpsychiatric side effect profile of quetiapine fumarate were investigated in 26
      patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder in a
      multicenter, two-period, multiple-dose, open-label, randomized trial. Over a 1-
      to 2-week period, patients were titrated to a 300-mg twice-daily dose of
      quetiapine. Patients treated for at least 7 days at the target dose entered a
      combination therapy period, receiving fluoxetine (60 mg daily) or imipramine (75 
      mg twice daily) for 8 days. Key assessments included pharmacokinetic analysis of 
      quetiapine, the Udvalg for kliniske undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale,
      and safety evaluations (e.g., adverse events, electrocardiograms, laboratory
      tests, and vital signs). Fluoxetine increased the quetiapine area under the
      plasma concentration time curve during a 12-hour interval (+12%), maximum plasma 
      concentration during the dosing interval (C(ss)(max); +26%), and minimum plasma
      concentration at the end of the dosing interval (+8%), although it decreased oral
      clearance (-11%). The change in C(ss)(max) was statistically although not
      clinically significant. Imipramine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of
      quetiapine. Overall, scores on the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale improved during
      combination therapy with either agent, and no statistically significant
      deterioration was observed for any item. For safety assessments, the only
      clinically remarkable event was an imipramine-associated complete left bundle
      branch block in one patient. No unexpected side effects were reported. In
      conclusion, combination therapy with quetiapine and fluoxetine or imipramine had 
      a minimal effect on quetiapine pharmacokinetics and was well tolerated.

TI  - The safety and pharmacokinetics of quetiapine when coadministered with
      haloperidol, risperidone, or thioridazine.
PG  - 121-30
AB  - The effects of haloperidol, risperidone, and thioridazine on the pharmacokinetics
      and side-effect profile of quetiapine were investigated in 36 patients with
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder in a single-center, 
      two-period, multiple-dose, open-label, randomized trial. Over a one-to two-week
      period, quetiapine doses were escalated to 300 mg twice daily (bid). Patients
      were then treated for at least 7 days at the target quetiapine dose and
      subsequently entered into the combination therapy period, receiving haloperidol
      (7.5 mg, bid), risperidone (3 mg, bid), or thioridazine (200 mg, bid) for 8.5
      days (after 3 days of dose escalation). Key assessments included the
      pharmacokinetics of quetiapine at steady state (area under the curve within a
      dosing interval [AUCtSS], maximum [CmaxSS], and minimum [CminSS] observed plasma 
      concentrations, and oral clearance [Cl/f]), as well as the UKU Side Effect Rating
      Scale scores and safety evaluations. Neither risperidone nor haloperidol had
      significant effects on quetiapine pharmacokinetics. However, thioridazine
      produced statistically significant changes, decreasing the least squares means
      values of the AUCtSS, CmaxSS, and CminSS by 40%, 47%, and 31%, respectively, and 
      increasing Cl/f by 68%. Increases in the following adverse events were noted
      during coadministration: somnolence (risperidone), insomnia and dry mouth (all
      three coadministered therapies), and dizziness (thioridazine). UKU side effect
      items that became worse in >or= 25% of patients during each coadministration
      period included sedation and increased sleep duration. Results of laboratory
      tests, electrocardiograms, and vital sign measurements revealed few clinically
      important changes. Clinical stability can be maintained with good tolerability
      during the transition from quetiapine monotherapy to periods of coadministration 
      with haloperidol, risperidone, or thioridazine. Coadministration of either
      haloperidol or risperidone did not have any important effects on the steady-state
      pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Thioridazine significantly increased the oral
      clearance of quetiapine. Increased doses of quetiapine may be necessary to
      control psychotic symptoms when thioridazine is coadministered with quetiapine.

TI  - Cerebellar blood volume in bipolar patients correlates with medication.
PG  - 370-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebellar abnormalities, including decreased tissue volume, have
      been implicated in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Relatively little
      research has focused on blood flow in the cerebellum of patients with bipolar
      disorder. Furthermore, the significance of metabolic changes in the brains of
      psychiatric patients may be confounded by the effects of various
      pharmacotherapies. Having previously found differences in cerebellar blood volume
      in patients with bipolar disorder compared to healthy control subjects, this
      study examined whether some variability in the patient population may be an
      effect of medication. METHODS: In this study, we have examined the association
      between medication status and cerebellar blood volume. Thirteen healthy
      comparison subjects and 21 bipolar patients underwent dynamic susceptibility
      contrast magnetic resonance imaging. Nine cerebellar regions were identified, and
      the absolute cerebellar blood volume data from each was compared to medication
      status measures. RESULTS: Patients on conventional antipsychotics had the lowest 
      mean absolute blood volume measures for all cerebellar regions, whereas those on 
      atypical antipsychotics had the highest blood volume measures. Comparison
      subjects had cerebellar blood volume measures in the middle, with results closer 
      to subjects in the atypical group. CONCLUSIONS: This evidence suggests that
      antipsychotic treatment may influence cerebellar blood volume. This effect will
      be important in considering imaging studies on medicated patients with bipolar
      disorder and may suggest novel pathways by which these medications affect their
      changes.

TI  - A double blind placebo controlled trial of donepezil adjunctive treatment to
      risperidone for the cognitive impairment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 349-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the beneficial effects of atypical antipsychotics on
      cognition, these improvements will not return most schizophrenic patients to
      normative standards of cognitive functioning. Therefore, other treatments need to
      be considered. Subtle changes in cholinergic function in schizophrenic patients
      provide the rationale to test the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors in
      treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. METHODS: Given this, a 12-week,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil (5 mg and 10 mg) as
      adjunctive treatment to risperidone was conducted in a total of 36 schizophrenic 
      patients. RESULTS: Neither the 5-mg nor 10-mg dose of donepezil produced
      significant improvements in any cognitive measure compared with placebo.
      CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that nicotinic receptor desensitization produced by
      chronic tobacco use in these patients rendered their nicotinic receptors
      refractory to the effects of increased agonist activity produced by donepezil. An
      alternative treatment is the allosterically potentiating ligands, which enhance
      the activity of (sensitize) nicotinic receptors in the presence of acetylcholine.

      olanzapine with haloperidol (n = 1996) and olanzapine with risperidone (n = 339).
      Both studies comprised double-blinded, placebo controlled, random assignment
      trials. Health outcomes reported include: (i) time to discontinuation in the
      trial; (ii) clinical relapse; and (iii) time to drug non-compliance. When outcome
      was measured as time to discontinuation due to adverse events or lack of
      efficacy, olanzapine showed superiority over haloperidol and no difference
      compared to risperidone. Of those patients who had an initial response, there was
      no significant difference between olanzapine and haloperidol when outcome was
      measured using either: (i) 52-week relapse rates or (ii) time to first
      non-compliance. Using the measures of study discontinuation, relapse and
      non-compliance, in one trial the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was superior
      to haloperidol, while in a second trial there were no differences between
      olanzapine and risperidone.

TI  - Mianserin or placebo as adjuncts to typical antipsychotics in resistant
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - The beneficial effect of atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) in
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients has been attributed, mostly, to their 
      relatively high serotonergic (5-HT)2 to dopaminergic (D)2 receptor blockade
      ratio. We hypothesized that a combination of typical APDs (D2 antagonists) and
      mianserin, a potent 5-HT2 antagonist, might also exert superior efficacy in this 
      population. Eighteen inpatients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who had an
      acute psychotic exacerbation of the disorder received, in a double-blind design, 
      30 mg/day mianserin (n = 9) or placebo (n = 9) in conjunction with typical
      neuroleptics [haloperidol (n = 9) or perphenazine (n = 9)]. Clinical status was
      evaluated before, during, and at the end of 6 weeks of combined treatment with
      the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Positive
      Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms and Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression. The typical APD/mianserin group exhibited
      significantly greater improvement in total BPRS scores (17.6% versus 5.5%; P=
      0.03) and a trend towards greater improvement in SAPS scores (35.3% versus 13.0%;
      P = 0.07). Our study indicates that patients with chronic treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia who have an acute psychotic exacerbation ('acute-on-chronic') may
      benefit from the addition of a potent 5-HT2 blocker, such as mianserin, to
      typical antipsychotics. Our findings may further emphasize the contribution of
      enhanced 5-HT2 blockade to the 'atypicality' of the atypical APDs and to their
      greater efficacy in alleviating symptoms of chronic treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia.

      reuptake-associated female sexual dysfunction: a randomized, placebo controlled
      trial.
PG  - 147-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many agents have been proposed as potential treatments for
      SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction, but few placebo-controlled trials have been
      reported. METHOD: After a 1-month baseline evaluation, pre-menopausal women with 
      moderate to severe sexual dysfunction associated with the institution of
      fluoxetine therapy were randomized to augmentation therapy with placebo (N=39),
      mirtazapine (N=36), yohimbine (N=35) or olanzapine (N=38) for a 6-week period.
      Outcomes were measured using a daily diary, a biweekly self-report assessment,
      and a computer assisted structured interview. RESULTS: At baseline, orgasm was
      most severely impaired. After 6 weeks, there was statistically significant
      improvement on most measures for the overall group of patients, however there
      were few differences between treatment groups. Isolated treatment differences
      were observed for the patient self-report of overall sexual function (olanzapine 
      superior to placebo) and the structured interview sexual satisfaction item
      (mirtazapine inferior to placebo). CONCLUSION: No drug assessed was consistently 
      associated with differences from placebo. The results of the study do not support
      uncontrolled reports of efficacy for these agents in premenopausal women.

PG  - 139-44
AB  - The treatment of aggressive symptoms in schizophrenic patients is a relevant
      clinical problem. We systematically review the efficacy of the different atypical
      neuroleptics on acute or persistent aggressive symptoms also regarding
      methodological problems. Currently typical neuroleptics are still first choice in
      treating acute aggressive symptoms, while risperidone and olanzapine could be
      alternatives. In persistent aggression clozapin shows the best specific results. 
      Typical depot neuroleptics should be considered in cases when medication
      compliance is a problem.

PG  - 645-52
AB  - A survey of clinical and therapeutic evolution in patients treated with an
      atypical antipsychotic, risperidone or olanzapine, was carried out at La
      Colombiere Psychiatric Hospital, Montpellier. This prospective observational
      study was conducted over 6 months. Forty-nine patients were included in the
      olanzapine treatment group and thirty-five in the risperidone treatment group.
      The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale was used for evaluation at day 0, 7,
      30, 90 and 180 of treatment. The majority of patients were improved after 30 days
      of treatment, and clinical improvement was observed in about 60 per cent of
      patients among those treated at day 180. The main therapeutic benefit occurred in
      respect of positive psychotic symptoms. Patients were discharged after 30 days of
      treatment. The atypical antipsychotic was not used with an additional neuroleptic
      for all patients. Tolerance was good, particularly for olanzapine. On the other
      hand, according to our results, others studies have to be performed to confirm
      the impact of the treatment on weight gain, assessment of subjective elements
      such as sedation, and the direct effect of the atypical antipsychotics on primary
      negative symptoms.

TI  - A retrospective economic evaluation of olanzapine versus risperidone in the
      treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 75-81
AB  - This retrospective study evaluates drug treatment patterns and economic outcomes 
      of olanzapine in comparison with risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia in
      usual practice. Results showed that patients taking olanzapine versus risperidone
      stayed on therapy longer (P < .0001) and were prescribed anti-Parkinsonian
      medications less frequently (P < .005). Compared with risperidone, olanzapine
      treatment resulted in lower direct mental health care costs ($1,827 less, P <
      .03) and lower direct total health care costs ($1,834 less, P < .05). The results
      of this study suggest that the initial selection of an antipsychotic for the
      treatment of schizophrenia is important: Olanzapine offset its acquisition cost
      by reducing medical service costs and demonstrated better drug treatment patterns
      than risperidone.

TI  - What role do atypical antipsychotic drugs have in treatment-resistant depression?
PG  - 95-103
AB  - Despite significant advances in the treatment of depression, many patients fail
      to respond to treatment with adequate dose and duration. Multiple therapeutic
      approaches are available for the treatment of patients not responding to standard
      antidepressant medication. These include switching medication or combination and 
      augmentation strategies. A substantial number of patients do not respond to
      multiple treatment trials. These patients suffer from treatment-resistant
      depression (TRD) and represent a challenge to the treating physician. There have 
      been a growing number of reports on the use of atypical antipsychotics as
      augmenting agents in nonpsychotic TRD. Second-generation antipsychotics are less 
      likely to provoke parkinsonian side effects. It has also been reported that these
      agents produce lower rates of tardive movement disorders than traditional
      neuroleptics. Furthermore, second-generation antipsychotics are serotonin-2A/2C
      antagonists, possibly allowing them to improve the efficacy and some aspects of
      the side effect profile of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
      Weight gain and sedation are likely to be the most common adverse events of such 
      combined therapy. In a recent controlled clinical trial, the atypical
      antipsychotic olanzapine was combined with fluoxetine therapy in an 8-week,
      double-blind clinical trial in patients with TRD. This combination drug therapy
      demonstrated clinical efficacy on several rating scales and showed rapid onset of
      action. Although more studies will be required to confirm and extend these
      findings, the results suggest that there may be a clinical benefit to combining
      atypical antipsychotics with SSRIs in nonpsychotic TRD.

TI  - Obsessive-compulsive symptoms during treatment with olanzapine and risperidone: a
      prospective study of 113 patients with recent-onset schizophrenia or related
      disorders.
PG  - 104-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS)
      differs during treatment with olanzapine or risperidone and to establish whether 
      duration of antipsychotic treatment is related to severity of OCS. METHOD: We
      conducted a prospective study of consecutively hospitalized young patients (mean 
      age = 22.4 years) with DSM-IV schizophrenia or related disorders (N = 113) who
      were treated with olanzapine or risperidone. Olanzapine or risperidone was
      randomly prescribed for patients who were drug-naive or were treated with typical
      antipsychotics before admission (N = 36). Patients who had started olanzapine (N 
      = 39) or risperidone treatment (N = 23) prior to admission continued with that
      medication if they showed initial clinical response. Patients who prior to
      admission started olanzapine (N = 6) or risperidone (N = 9) but showed no
      response or suffered from adverse effects switched at admission to risperidone or
      olanzapine, respectively. Medical records, parents, and patients revealed
      information on duration of treatment and compliance with olanzapine or
      risperidone prior to admission. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS)
      was administered at admission and 6 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: At baseline and
      6-week assessments, OCS were found in about 30% of 106 evaluable cases and 15%
      met DSM-IV criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder. No differences in OCS were
      found in the patients randomly assigned to olanzapine or risperidone. The 35
      subjects treated with olanzapine at both assessments had significantly (p = .01) 
      more severe OCS at week 6 than the 20 subjects treated with risperidone at both
      assessments. Duration of treatment with olanzapine was significantly (p < .01)
      related to severity of OCS. CONCLUSION: There are no differences in the
      short-term propensity of olanzapine or risperidone to induce or exacerbate OCS.
      However, severity of OCS was associated with duration of treatment with
      olanzapine.

TI  - Placebo-controlled trial of D-cycloserine added to conventional neuroleptics,
      olanzapine, or risperidone in schizophrenia.
PG  - 480-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated the clinical effects of D-cycloserine when
      added to treatment with conventional neuroleptics, olanzapine, or risperidone for
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia. METHOD: Twenty-four patients participated in a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week crossover trial with D-cycloserine, 50
      mg/day, added to their fixed dose of antipsychotic medication. Clinical ratings
      were performed every 2 weeks. RESULTS: D-Cycloserine treatment was well tolerated
      and resulted in a significant reduction in negative symptoms (mean=15%). The
      degree of improvement did not differ between patients treated with conventional
      neuroleptics and those treated with olanzapine or risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: These
      data support the efficacy of the addition of 50 mg/day of D-cycloserine to
      treatment with conventional neuroleptics and suggest that therapeutic benefits
      may also be attained when D-cycloserine is added to olanzapine or risperidone.

TI  - Cytokine profiles in schizophrenic patients treated with risperidone: a 3-month
      follow-up study.
PG  - 33-9
AB  - An increasing body of evidence suggests a role for the immune system in the
      pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The information concerning the effects of
      antipsychotics on cytokine profiles are limited and often controversial in
      particular regarding novel antipsychotics. The authors first investigated the
      production of various cytokines [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-10, interferon
      (INF)-gamma] in drug-free (n = 12) and drug-naive (n = 3) schizophrenic patients 
      and in healthy controls (n = 33) and then the modifications of cytokines values
      during a 3-month period of treatment with risperidone. In the baseline condition,
      the production of IL-2 and INF-gamma was significantly higher (P = .023 and .026,
      respectively) in patients than in controls. In the same patients, the use of
      risperidone was associated with augmented IL-10 (a suppressor of Type I
      cytokines) and decreased INF-gamma production. This modification suggests that
      clinical improvement is associated with a reduction in the inflammatory-like
      situation present in not currently treated schizophrenic patients.

TI  - Vitamin B6 as add-on treatment in chronic schizophrenic and schizoaffective
      patients: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 54-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin B6, or pyridoxine, plays an intrinsic role in the synthesis
      of certain neurotransmitters that take part in development of psychotic states.
      Several reports indicate that vitamin B6 may be a factor in a number of
      psychiatric disorders and related conditions, such as autism, Alzheimer's
      disease, hyperactivity, learning disability, anxiety disorder, and depression.
      Moreover, there are anecdotal reports of a reduction in psychotic symptoms after 
      vitamin B6 supplementation of psychopharmacologic treatment of patients suffering
      from schizophrenia or organic mental disorder. The aim of this study was to
      examine whether vitamin B6 therapy influences psychotic symptoms in patients
      suffering from schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. METHOD: The effects of
      the supplementation of vitamin B6 to antipsychotic treatment on positive and
      negative symptoms in 15 schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients (DSM-IV
      criteria) were examined in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study
      spanning 9 weeks. All patients had stable psychopathology for at least 1 month
      before entry into the study and were maintained on treatment with their prestudy 
      psychoactive and antiparkinsonian medications throughout the study. All patients 
      were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for
      schizophrenia on a weekly basis. Patients randomly received placebo or vitamin
      B6, starting at 100 mg/day in the first week and increasing to 400 mg/day in the 
      fourth week by 100-mg increments each week. RESULTS: PANSS scores revealed no
      differences between vitamin B6- and placebo-treated patients in amelioration of
      their mental state. CONCLUSION: Further studies with larger populations and
      shorter duration of illness are needed to clarify the question of the possible
      efficacy of vitamin B6 in treatment of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.

TI  - Epidemiology of primary blepharospasm.
PG  - 7-12
AB  - We review epidemiological data on primary blepharospasm (BSP). There is a large
      variation in the stated prevalence of BSP, with crude estimates ranging from 16
      to 133 per million in different studies. A large proportion of this variability
      may be the result of differences in physician education on BSP. Age and female
      gender may increase the risk of developing BSP. The few case-control studies
      focusing on adult dystonias including BSP showed an increased risk in association
      with family history of dystonia and/or postural tremor, prior head and face
      trauma, and prior eye disease (e.g., blepharitis and keratoconjunctivitis), and a
      decreased risk associated with cigarette smoking. No association was found with
      age-related medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, family history 
      of parkinsonism, and a history of anxiety or depression. Broocks et al. [Am J
      Psychiatry, 1998;155:555-557] found a significantly higher frequency of
      obsessive-compulsive symptoms in BSP than hemifacial spasm despite the clinical
      similarity. Among putative risk factors for BSP, age at onset, female gender, and
      prior head or face trauma may affect spread of dystonia to adjacent body regions.
      While limited, the body of epidemiological data support the idea that
      environmental and familial, possibly genetic, factors may both be important in
      the etiology of BSP.

TI  - [Usefulness of olanzapine in the levodopa-induced psychosis in patients with
      Parkinson's disease].
PG  - 7-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapine (OLZ) in
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and drug-induced psychosis (DIP) and its
      repercussion on the motor function. METHODS: Ten patients (5 women and 5 men)
      diagnosed of PD and DIP, aged 67 years (range: 50-81), with PD duration of 11.1
      years (range: 6-23), treated chronically with levodopa per day, received a dose
      of 2.5 or 5.0 mg OLZ daily. Data concerning improvement of psychosis and
      worsening of motor function was based on Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale
      (PANSS) and Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor. RESULTS:
      Psychotic symptoms were improved in all patients. In most of them the improvement
      was almost total. Seven patients increased levodopa dose on OLZ, but significant 
      worsening of motor function was reported just in one patient. None of the
      patients had agranulocytosis in the blood monitoring. Two patients presented
      weight gain. Seven patients improved their cognitive status. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that OLZ at the doses studied may have efficacy for DIP which appears in
      PD and does not induce worsening of motor function in most of the patients.

TI  - Effect of influenza vaccination on serum clozapine and its main metabolite
      concentrations in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 705-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of influenza vaccine on serum clozapine,
      N-desmethylclozapine and clozapine-N-oxide steady-state concentrations in
      patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: This was an open-label study in 14
      schizophrenic inpatients (with 2 drop-outs) using clozapine. Serum trough
      concentrations of clozapine. N-desmethylclozapine and clozapine-N-oxide, as well 
      as the concentration of c-reactive protein (CRP), were measured immediately
      before conventional trivalent influenza vaccination and 2, 4, 7 and 14 days after
      the vaccination. RESULTS: Influenza vaccination had no significant effect on
      serum concentrations of clozapine, N-desmethylclozapine or clozapine-N-oxide. No 
      changes in the clinical effects of clozapine were observed after vaccination.
      Influenza vaccination did not increase CRP. However, two drop-out patients who
      developed upper respiratory and abdominal symptoms had increased and elevated
      serum concentrations of clozapine, compared with the baseline. CONCLUSIONS:
      Influenza vaccination using conventional trivalent influenza vaccine does not
      affect serum concentrations of clozapine or its main metabolites. However, an
      infection-related increase in CRP may be associated with increased serum
      concentration of clozapine.

TI  - Antipsychotic medication: effects on regulation of glucose and lipids.
PG  - 1571-82
AB  - Since the introduction of chlorpromazine in the 1950s, antipsychotics have been
      used for the treatment of schizophrenia. The phenothiazines were followed by the 
      butyrophenones, particularly haloperidol. With all the movement disorder side
      effects of these medications (extrapyramidal syndrome, akathisia, tardive
      dyskinesia), the pharmaceutical industry has gradually released atypical
      antipsychotics. This class includes clozapine (released in the USA in 1990),
      risperidone (1994), olanzapine (1996), quetiapine (1998) and ziprasidone (2001). 
      However, the rate of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia appeared to
      increase with the availability of this class of medications. In reviewing rate
      and degree of changes in weight, glucose control and lipid levels induced by
      typical and atypical antipsychotics, it was found that in contrast to case
      reports, there is a dearth of retrospective, open and controlled studies.
      However, in studies as early as 1964, significant weight increases were found to 
      be associated with use of chlorpromazine. While the phenothiazines may have some 
      effect on patients with chemical diabetes, there is little evidence of the
      typical antipsychotics producing diabetes mellitus de novo, or worsening diabetes
      that is already been discovered. Ziprasidone appears to be the antipsychotic with
      the most beneficial combination of effects: no weight gain, no change in glucose 
      utilisation and reductions in cholesterol and serum triglycerides (TGs).

TI  - Short report: comparison of patient satisfaction and burden of adverse effects
      with novel and conventional neuroleptics: a naturalistic study.
PG  - 597-600
AB  - Converging evidence indicates that, in controlled drug trials, individuals
      receiving novel antipsychotic medications have fewer adverse effects than those
      receiving conventional antipsychotic medications. This in turn may lead to
      greater patient treatment satisfaction. This study examines patient satisfaction 
      and burden of adverse effects in a county-wide epidemiologic study of first
      admission psychotic persons with psychosis who were receiving novel antipsychotic
      drugs (n = 42). Comparisons were made within this group, and between 25 of these 
      persons and 25 others with the same diagnosis and sex, from the same
      epidemiologic study, who were receiving a comparable regimen of conventional
      antipsychotic drugs. Patients receiving novel antipsychotics were significantly
      more satisfied and were significantly less burdened by adverse effects than those
      receiving conventional antipsychotics. Among the group receiving novel
      antipsychotics, dosage was not related to satisfaction or burden of adverse
      effects. For those treated with risperidone (n = 27), there was a difference,
      approaching statistical significance, for greater satisfaction and less adverse
      effect burden among those persons with dosages less than 5 mg daily as compared
      to higher dosages.

TI  - Clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol in the treatment of patients 
      with chronic schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 255-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the efficacy and safety of three atypical
      antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone) with one another and with
      haloperidol in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. METHOD: In a double-blind trial, 157 inpatients with a 
      history of suboptimal treatment response were randomly assigned to treatment with
      clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol for 14 weeks (an 8-week
      escalation and fixed-dose period followed by a 6-week variable-dose period).
      RESULTS: Clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine (but not haloperidol) resulted in
      statistically significant improvements in total score on the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale. Improvements seen in total and negative symptom scores
      with clozapine and olanzapine were superior to haloperidol. The atypical drugs,
      particularly olanzapine and clozapine, were associated with weight gain.
      CONCLUSIONS: The effects of atypical antipsychotics in this population were
      statistically significant but clinically modest. The overall pattern of results
      suggests that clozapine and olanzapine have similar general antipsychotic
      efficacy and that risperidone may be somewhat less effective. Clozapine was the
      most effective treatment for negative symptoms. However, the differences among
      treatments were small.

TI  - Amisulpride, an unusual "atypical" antipsychotic: a meta-analysis of randomized
      controlled trials.
PG  - 180-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The "atypical" profile of the new antipsychotics clozapine,
      olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone has been linked to combined antagonism of
      serotonin 2 (5-HT(2)) and dopamine 2 (D(2)) receptors. Although amisulpride is a 
      highly selective D(3)/D(2) receptor antagonist, it is assumed to have atypical
      properties as well. The purpose of this article was to compare the atypical
      profile of amisulpride with that of the 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonists. METHOD:
      Randomized controlled trials that compared amisulpride with conventional
      antipsychotics or placebo for patients with schizophrenia were identified and
      included in a meta-analysis. The mean effect sizes found for amisulpride were
      compared with those of an updated meta-analysis of the 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonists. 
      RESULTS: Eighteen randomized controlled trials of amisulpride (N=2,214) were
      found. In 11 studies of acutely ill patients it proved to be consistently more
      effective than conventional antipsychotics for global schizophrenic symptoms
      (measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) and negative symptoms.
      Amisulpride is to date the only atypical antipsychotic for which several studies 
      of patients suffering predominantly from negative symptoms have been published.
      In four such studies amisulpride was significantly more effective than placebo.
      Three small studies with conventional antipsychotics as comparators showed only a
      trend in favor of amisulpride in this regard. Amisulpride was associated with
      clearly lower use of antiparkinsonian medication and with fewer dropouts due to
      adverse events than conventional antipsychotics. CONCLUSIONS: These results cast 
      some doubt on the notion that combined 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonism is the reason that
      the newer antipsychotic medications are effective for negative symptoms and have 
      fewer extrapyramidal side effects.

TI  - The effects of olanzapine on the 5 dimensions of schizophrenia derived by factor 
      analysis: combined results of the North American and international trials.
PG  - 757-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: The choice of drug to treat a patient with schizophrenia is one of
      the most critical clinical decisions. Controversy exists on the differential
      efficacy of olanzapine. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Raw data from all 4
      registrational double-blind, random-assignment studies of olanzapine compared
      with placebo or haloperidol were obtained from Eli Lilly and Company for this
      meta-analysis. METHOD: Analysis of covariance of the intent-to-treat
      last-observation-carried-forward endpoint scores was used to assess efficacy on
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS) total scores and the 5 factors derived by factor analysis (negative
      symptoms, positive symptoms, disorganized thoughts, impulsivity/hostility, and
      anxiety/depression). RESULTS: Olanzapine produced a statistically significantly
      greater reduction in schizophrenic symptoms than haloperidol (p < .05) on total
      scores on the BPRS and PANSS on each of the 5 factors as well as on almost all
      items. Olanzapine induced a response at a rate equal to that induced by
      haloperidol in the first few weeks, but by the end of the study produced a
      greater percentage of responders. Compared with haloperidol, olanzapine produced 
      a somewhat greater response on symptoms responsive to haloperidol, but a markedly
      better response on symptoms unresponsive to haloperidol. This difference favoring
      olanzapine occurred to an equal degree in all subgroups examined. The incidence
      of parkinsonism or akathisia following olanzapine treatment was extremely low and
      not statistically distinguishable from placebo. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine produced a
      greater improvement than haloperidol particularly by benefiting a much larger
      number of items or factors. Extrapyramidal side effects and akathisia during
      olanzapine treatment were statistically indistinguishable from effects seen with 
      placebo.

TI  - Olanzapine for the treatment of psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease
      and dementia.
PG  - 477-81
AB  - Psychotic symptoms are a common complication in Parkinson's disease with
      dementia. The authors conducted an open-label 6-week trial of olanzapine preceded
      by a placebo lead-in in five subjects with Parkinson's disease, mild to
      moderately severe dementia, and psychosis. Four of the subjects terminated the
      trial early because of worsening motor function, sedation, or paranoia. There was
      no improvement in psychotic symptoms, and functional abilities declined
      significantly. Olanzapine appears to be poorly tolerated in patients with
      Parkinson's disease, psychotic symptoms, and dementia.

TI  - Melperone in the treatment of neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia.
PG  - 201-9
AB  - Melperone is an effective antipsychotic drug that has been reported to have
      atypical properties, i.e. low extrapyramidal side effect liability at clinically 
      effective doses. It also does not increase serum prolactin levels. Its
      effectiveness for patients with neuroleptic (treatment)-resistant schizophrenia
      has not been evaluated. In this study, melperone was administered, in an open
      trial design of 6 weeks' duration, to 44 patients with chronic
      neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia. The Global Assessment Scale (GAS), Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and measures of extrapyramidal symptoms and other
      clinical variables were assessed at baseline and 6 weeks. Thirty-seven patients
      completed the 6-week trial. Melperone significantly improved overall psychiatric 
      status as measured by GAS score for all evaluable subjects [last value carried
      forward (LVCF) and a completers analysis]. No significant effects on BPRS
      measures of psychopathology scores were found in the LVCF or completers analysis.
      Patients who showed > or = 20% decrease in the BPRS Total score (N=7) were more
      likely to have high baseline psychopathology, as measured by BPRS Total and
      Anxiety-Depression subscales, than those who showed > or = 20% increase in the
      BPRS Total score (N=8). Non-responders to melperone generally did not respond to 
      subsequent treatment with clozapine, indicating that this group of patients was
      very treatment resistant. Melperone was not associated with worsening of
      extrapyramidal symptoms, elevation in plasma prolactin levels, or an increase in 
      body mass index (BMI). The results suggest that a proportion of
      neuroleptic-resistant patients with schizophrenia respond to melperone, which
      requires further controlled study.

TI  - Adjunctive high-dose glycine in the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 385-91
AB  - Glycine is an agonist at brain N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and crosses the
      blood-brain barrier following high-dose oral administration. In a previous study,
      significant improvements in negative and cognitive symptoms were observed in a
      group of 21 schizophrenic patients receiving high-dose glycine in addition to
      antipsychotic treatment. This study evaluated the degree to which symptom
      improvements might be related to alterations in antipsychotic drug levels in an
      additional group of 12 subjects. Glycine treatment was associated with an 8-fold 
      increase in serum glycine levels, similar to that observed previously. A
      significant 34% reduction in negative symptoms was observed during glycine
      treatment. Serum antipsychotic levels were not significantly altered. Significant
      clinical effects were observed despite the fact that the majority of subjects
      were receiving atypical antipsychotics (clozapine or olanzapine). As in earlier
      studies, improvement persisted following glycine discontinuation.

TI  - Social functioning and quality of life in the schizophrenic patient: advantages
      of amisulpride.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Schizophrenia is associated with significant social, psychological and
      occupational dysfunction. Not only is this distressing for the patients and their
      family and friends, but it also results in high indirect costs. Reintegration
      back into society, one of the most important aspects of quality life for
      schizophrenic patients and their physicians, must therefore take into account a
      patient's social functioning and employability, as well as improvement in
      symptoms. Although the typical antipsychotics are effective in managing the
      positive symptoms of schizophrenia, they may not alleviate other aspects of the
      disorder. They are also associated with extrapyramidal symptoms and other severe 
      adverse events that have significant consequences for quality of life and
      compliance. The atypical antipsychotic, amisulpride, has an improved safety and
      tolerability profile and has been shown to be significantly more effective than
      placebo and haloperidol on a number of quality of life and social functioning
      scales, including the Global Assessment of Functioning, the Quality of Life
      Scale, the Functional Status Questionnaire and the Psychosocial Aptitude Rating
      Scale. In conclusion, amisulpride, in addition to its proven clinical efficacy,
      may help reintegration of the schizophrenic patient back into society.

TI  - Clinical advantages of amisulpride in the treatment of acute schizophrenia.
PG  - 451-66
AB  - Five studies have been conducted with the atypical anti-psychotic amisulpride
      (100-1200 mg/day) involving 1358 patients with acute exacerbations of
      schizophrenia; four studies were short-term (4-8 weeks), double-blind studies and
      one was a 12-month, open, randomized comparison. Amisulpride improved positive
      symptoms consistently, and changes were more pronounced than with haloperidol,
      flupenthixol and risperidone; amisulpride showed a more rapid onset of action
      compared to haloperidol, and improvement in negative symptoms was more effective 
      than with any comparator. An optimum response was obtained with amisulpride doses
      400-800 mg/day. The long-term study confirmed the usefulness of amisulpride for
      maintenance treatment in schizophrenia, with a clear advantage over haloperidol, 
      leading to better functioning and quality of life. Amisulpride caused fewer
      neurological side-effects than conventional anti-psychotics and less weight gain 
      than risperidone, both of which are crucial factors for long-term compliance.

TI  - Lorazepam, sedation, and conscious recollection: a dose-response study with
      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - The role of sedation in the benzodiazepine-induced impairment of conscious
      recollection is still subject to debate. The aim of this study was to investigate
      further the role of sedation using the Remember-Know procedure and a
      physiological measure of sedation based on pupillography in addition to standard 
      measures of sedation and attention (digit-symbol substitution task, symbol
      cancellation task, self-rated sedation). Twelve subjects were tested after the
      intake of placebo, lorazepam 0.026 mg/kg and lorazepam 0.038 mg/kg, administered 
      in a randomized order, with a minimum interval of 8 days between each
      administration. On a recognition memory task, they were asked to give 'Remember',
      'Know' or 'Guess' responses to items that were recognized on the basis of
      conscious recollection, familiarity, or guessing, respectively. Lorazepam
      selectively impaired recognition based on 'Remember' responses. This impairment
      was greater in the lorazepam 0.038 mg/kg than in the lorazepam 0.026 mg/kg
      groups. Measures of sedation were not correlated with the proportion of
      'Remember' responses. These results suggest that sedation alone cannot account
      for the impairment of conscious recollection induced by lorazepam.

TI  - Risperidone in the treatment of tourette syndrome: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 31-9
AB  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine the efficacy 
      and tolerability of 8 weeks of treatment with risperidone in the management of 48
      adolescent and adult patients with Tourette syndrome. Twenty-four patients were
      randomly assigned to treatment with risperidone in doses of 0.5 to 6.0 mg/day,
      and 24 were assigned to placebo. The dosage of medication was increased in fixed 
      increments during the first week of double-blind treatment and thereafter in a
      flexible dose regimen according to clinical response. Risperidone, at a median
      dose of 2.5 mg/day (range, 1 to 6 mg/day), was found to be significantly ( p <
      0.05) superior to placebo on the Global Severity Rating of the Tourette Syndrome 
      Severity Scale. The proportion of patients who improved by at least one point on 
      this seven-point scale was 60.8% in the risperidone group and 26.1% in the
      placebo group. Treatment with risperidone was accompanied by an improvement in
      global functioning in patients with average to above-average impairment at
      baseline as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. With respect 
      to extrapyramidal symptom scores measured on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating
      Scale, hypokinesia and tremor increased in the risperidone group, but the effect 
      on tremor was largely confined to subjects with higher baseline tremor scores.
      There were no significant differences in dystonic reactions, dyskinetic
      movements, subjective parkinsonism, or akathisia. Risperidone did not increase
      obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Fatigue and somnolence were the most common
      adverse events associated with risperidone.

TI  - Effects of risperidone on gonadal axis hormones in schizophrenia.
PG  - 1523-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of risperidone on the
      hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis of chronic schizophrenic male inpatients
      medicated regularly. METHODS: Subjects included six inpatients who were diagnosed
      according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition, criteria for 
      schizophrenia, and were termed treatment-refractory. Each patient gave informed
      consent for the research involved in this study. The neuroendocrine studies were 
      done before and during risperidone administration. Patients took a mean dose of
      risperidone 9.5 mg/d for a mean period of 64.2 days. Psychotic symptoms were
      assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). RESULTS: Prolactin
      (PRL) increased significantly during risperidone administration. However,
      luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone did not show 
      significant difference between blood concentrations before and during risperidone
      administration. Scores of the BPRS total, thought disturbance factor, and tension
      decreased significantly during risperidone administration. Throughout the study, 
      none of the patients experienced clinically significant problems associated with 
      elevated PRL concentrations including gynecomastia and/or sexual dysfunction.
      CONCLUSIONS: Addition of risperidone produced significant improvement of
      psychotic symptoms in treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients, and an increase
      in basal blood PRL concentrations, but not in basal blood HPG axis hormone
      concentrations. This preliminary result warrants further double-blind evaluation 
      with a larger sample.

TI  - Risk of extrapyramidal syndromes with haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine.
PG  - 1517-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk of extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) between
      risperidone, olanzapine, and haloperidol, taking into account patients' past
      antipsychotic drug use and past EPS. METHODS: Data were obtained from the
      PHARMO-database, containing filled prescriptions of 450,000 community-dwelling
      people in the Netherlands from 1986 through 1999. We defined cohorts of
      first-time users of haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine aged 15 to 54 years. 
      In the first 90 days of treatment, we assessed the occurrence of EPS, defined as 
      first use of any antiparkinsonian agent. We estimated relative risks of EPS for
      risperidone and olanzapine versus haloperidol using a Cox proportional hazards
      model. Patients were subdivided according to prior use of antipsychotic and
      antiparkinsonian drugs. RESULTS: We identified 424 patients starting treatment
      with haloperidol, 243 with risperidone, and 181 with olanzapine. Prior use of
      antipsychotic plus antiparkinsonian medication was significantly more frequent
      among users of risperidone and olanzapine than in those using haloperidol (36.2%,
      40.3%, and 4.5%, respectively; p < 0.001). Within most subgroups of comparable
      treatment history, patients using risperidone and olanzapine showed reduced risks
      of EPS compared with haloperidol, although some of these findings did not reach
      statistical significance (RR 0.03-0.22). However, this was not observed for
      patients using risperidone who had experienced EPS in the past (RR 1.30; 95% CI
      0.24 to 7.18). CONCLUSIONS: In general, we observed reduced risks of EPS for
      risperidone and olanzapine compared with haloperidol within subgroups of patients
      with a similar treatment history. However, the added value of risperidone in
      patients who have experienced EPS in the past needs further study.

TI  - An open trial of olanzapine in the treatment of patients with psychotic
      depression.
PG  - 147-51
AB  - Compared to major depression without psychosis, psychotic depression often
      responds poorly to treatment with tricyclic antidepressants alone. Atypical
      antipsychotics, which appear to possess thymoleptic properties, may represent a
      new treatment alternative for patients with psychotic mood disorders. This
      open-label, pilot study evaluated the efficacy of olanzapine monotherapy in
      patients with psychotic depression. Seven inpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for 
      a major depressive episode (unipolar) with psychotic features participated in a
      10-week open-label trial of olanzapine 10-20 mg/day. The Hamilton Rating Scale
      for Depression (HRSD), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), 
      and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) were performed at each visit to
      evaluate clinical response. Four out of the 5 study completers responded during
      the trial. Overall, there was a statistically significant change between baseline
      and final visit on the SAPS, HRSD, and the CGI Scale (p < .001). The results of
      this pilot study suggest that olanzapine may be an effective treatment for some
      patients with unipolar psychotic depression. However, these observations require 
      replication in randomized, controlled trials.

TI  - Donepezil in schizophrenia--is it helpful? An experimental design case study.
PG  - 469-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and cognitive effects of adding donepezil, a
      reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, to the risperidone treatment of a high
      functioning stable out-patient with schizophrenia. METHOD: Case study using an
      experimental ABAB design. Assessments were completed objectively by standardized 
      neuropsychological tests and clinical rating scales and subjectively with visual 
      analogue scales. RESULTS: Strong improvements attributable to donepezil were
      found for verbal fluency and the patient's subjective response. No adverse
      changes were noted in psychiatric symptoms or side effects. CONCLUSION:
      Cholinergic enhancement as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia should be
      explored in larger controlled trials.

TI  - Validation of the behavioural activity rating scale (BARS): a novel measure of
      activity in agitated patients.
PG  - 87-95
AB  - We report psychometric results of the Behavioural Activity Rating Scale (BARS)
      using data from three Phase III clinical trials of intramuscular ziprasidone in
      acutely agitated patients with psychosis (Studies 1 and 2) or in stable psychotic
      patients (Study 3). Convergent validity and divergent validity were assessed with
      baseline data from Studies 1 and 2 in subjects with acute agitation. To
      investigate convergent validity, we sought Pearson and Spearman correlation of
      BARS scores with scores on the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S)
      Scale and a predefined cluster of agitation-related items from the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). For divergent validity, we sought Pearson and
      Spearman correlation between BARS scores and a predefined cluster of PANSS items 
      measuring negative symptoms. Discriminant validity was investigated with the help
      of subjects with moderate psychopathology (Study 3). Wilcoxon rank-sum and
      two-sample t tests determined whether mean (or median) BARS scores differed
      between subjects with acute agitation (Studies 1 and 2) and moderate
      psychopathology (Study 3). Responsiveness to treatment effect and rater
      reliability were also evaluated. In Study 2, Pearson correlation coefficients of 
      BARS scores with PANSS agitation items and CGI-S were moderate (convergent
      validity) and statistically significant (P<0.005). The correlation between BARS
      scores and PANSS negative component scores was low (divergent validity).
      Treatment effect size was larger for BARS than for PANSS agitation items and
      CGI-S (responsive to treatment differences). Virtually perfect inter- and
      intra-rater reliability was achieved. Study 1 produced similar results. BARS
      showed psychometrically valid properties for measurement of behavioral activity
      in acutely agitated patients with psychosis.

TI  - Olanzapine treatment of female borderline personality disorder patients: a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.
PG  - 849-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intent of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of
      olanzapine versus placebo in the treatment of women meeting criteria for
      borderline personality disorder (BPD). METHOD: We conducted a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of olanzapine in 28 female subjects meeting Revised
      Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-IV criteria for BPD. The subjects
      were randomly assigned to olanzapine or placebo in a 2:1 manner. Treatment
      duration was 6 months. Primary outcome measures were self-reported changes on
      anxiety, depression, paranoia, anger/hostility, and interpersonal sensitivity
      scales of the Symptom Checklist-90. RESULTS: Nineteen subjects were randomly
      assigned to olanzapine; 9. to placebo. When random effects regression modeling of
      panel data was used, controlling for baseline level of severity, olanzapine was
      associated with a significantly (p < .05) greater rate of improvement over time
      than placebo in all of the symptom areas studied except depression. Weight gain
      was modest in the olanzapine-treated group but was significantly higher than in
      those treated with placebo (p < .02). In addition, no serious movement disorders 
      were noted. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine appears to be a safe and effective agent in
      the treatment of women with criteria-defined BPD, significantly affecting all 4
      core areas of borderline psychopathology (i.e., affect, cognition, impulsivity,
      and interpersonal relationships).

TI  - Pharmacologic treatment of hospitalized patients with schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 94-6
AB  - This study examined changes in the pharmacologic treatment of 70 patients who
      were hospitalized with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder at some time
      during a six-year period. An increasing use of divalproex sodium and atypical
      antipsychotics instead of lithium and conventional antipsychotics was observed.
      The use of a combination of an antipsychotic and a thymoleptic medication was
      more common than monotherapy, and physicians tended to continue antidepressants
      if patients had a history of depression. Patients with a new diagnosis of
      schizoaffective disorder were stabilized less quickly than those with a previous 
      diagnosis. The use of divalproex sodium and newer antipsychotics did not reduce
      the time to stabilization in routine clinical practice.

TI  - The pharmacovigilance of olanzapine: results of a post-marketing surveillance
      study on 8858 patients in England.
PG  - 265-71
AB  - Olanzapine is an 'atypical' antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of
      schizophrenia. We analysed adverse events (AEs) reported in primary practice in
      England. Dispensed prescriptions issued between December 1996 and May 1998
      provided exposure data. Questionnaires sent to general practitioners provided
      outcomes. Frequently reported AEs were: drowsiness/sedation (n = 19),
      extrapyramidal disorder (n = 13) and unspecified side-effects (n = 33). Events
      with highest incidence density in first month and reason for stopping were:
      drowsiness/sedation [n = 153, incidence density (ID)1 18.9], weight gain (n =
      117, ID1 8.9) and malaise/lassitude (n = 65, ID1 5.2). Extrapyramidal disorders
      were more common in elderly population (> 70 years, ID1 3.6, risk 26.0 per 1,000 
      patients) compared to < 70 years (ID1 1.1, risk 8.4 per 1,000 patients). Serious 
      suspected adverse reactions were neuroleptic malignant syndrome (n = 1) and
      angioneurotic ooedema (n = 2). There were eight reports of diabetes mellitus
      assessed as possibly due to olanzapine. Diabetes mellitus was an unlabelled AE
      and possible signal generated by prescription-event monitoring.

TI  - Therapeutic effect of pirenzepine for clozapine-induced hypersalivation: a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study.
PG  - 608-11
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of pirenzepine in the
      treatment of clozapine-induced hypersalivation. Pirenzepine is reported to
      counteract hypersalivation by its selective antagonistic activity on the
      M4-muscarinic receptor, which is stimulated by clozapine. Twenty patients with
      clozapine-induced hypersalivation underwent a random-order, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over trial which lasted 8 weeks each for the
      pirenzepine and placebo investigations, with a 4-week washout period in between. 
      The severity of hypersalivation was assessed using an objective measure: saliva
      production monitored through the diameter of wetted surface on tissue paper
      placed over the patient's pillow. Our study showed that pirenzepine had no
      significant therapeutic effect on hypersalivation compared with placebo,
      suggesting that hypersalivation induced by clozapine might have a neurobiological
      basis other than the M4-muscarinic receptor.

TI  - The effect of olanzapine treatment on m-chlorophenylpiperazine-induced hormone
      release in schizophrenia.
PG  - 575-82
AB  - In addition to dopamine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been reported 
      to play an important role in schizophrenia. Besides blocking dopamine, atypical
      antipsychotics also block 5-HT receptors. The clinical efficacy of the atypical
      antipsychotic clozapine is associated with the 5-HT antagonistic action of the
      drug and a high serotonergic tone before treatment. The atypical antipsychotic
      olanzapine has a receptor-binding profile similar to that of clozapine. The
      present study investigated whether treatment with olanzapine blocks hormone
      release induced by the 5-HT2c agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) and, if
      so, whether this 5-HT antagonistic effect is related to treatment response.
      Eighteen male schizophrenic patients participated in this study. All patients
      were challenged with m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg orally) in a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled design after a drug-free period of at least 2 weeks.
      Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and prolactin plasma levels were
      measured every 30 minutes up to 210 minutes after challenge. Patients were
      treated for 6 weeks with 10 mg olanzapine daily in an open design, after which
      the challenge tests were repeated. Olanzapine significantly blocked m-CPP-induced
      ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin release, suggesting that it is a potent 5-HT2c
      antagonist in vivo. This 5-HT antagonistic effect of olanzapine was not
      significantly correlated with treatment response. Also, no significant
      correlation was found between m-CPP-induced hormone release before treatment and 
      clinical response after treatment with olanzapine. These findings suggest that
      olanzapine is a potent 5-HT2c antagonist in vivo but that this is unrelated to
      its clinical efficacy in this nonrefractory sample of schizophrenic patients.

TI  - A dose-ranging exploratory study of the effects of ethyl-eicosapentaenoate in
      patients with persistent schizophrenic symptoms.
PG  - 7-18
AB  - The objective was to test effects of ethyl eicosapentaenoate (E-E) on persistent 
      ongoing symptoms in patients receiving different types of anti-schizophrenic
      drugs, typical antipsychotics, new atypical antipsychotics, and clozapine. 115
      patients with DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia were studied, 31 on clozapine, 48 on
      new atypical drugs and 36 on typical antipsychotics. Placebo or 1, 2 or 4 g/day
      of E-E was given for 12 weeks in addition to the background medication. The main 
      assessment was change from baseline to 12 weeks on the PANSS and its sub-scales. 
      There were no treatment-related side effects or adverse biochemical or
      haematological effects. Patients on 2 and 4 g/day E-E showed significant
      reductions in triglyceride levels which had been elevated by clozapine. In
      patients given 2 g/day E-E there were improvements on the PANSS and its
      sub-scales, but there was also a large placebo effect in patients on typical and 
      new atypical antipsychotics and no difference between active treatment and
      placebo. In patients on clozapine, in contrast, there was little placebo
      response, but a clinically important and statistically significant effect of E-E 
      on all rating scales. This effect was greatest at 2 g/day. There was a positive
      relationship between improvement on rating scales and rise in red blood cell
      arachidonic acid concentration.

TI  - [Clinical relevance and treatment possibilities of rapid cycling in patients with
      bipolar disorder].
PG  - 569-80
AB  - In the actual version of the WHO diagnostic guidelines, the ICD-10, subtypes of
      bipolar disorder are not specified, in contrast to the American DSM-IV, where
      bipolar disorder has already been differentiated in bipolar I (severe manic and
      depressive episodes) and bipolar II disorder (depressive and hypomanic episodes).
      Furthermore, aspects of the longitudinal course of the illness, like rapid
      cycling (RC), are reflected as well. Rapid cycling is defined as four or more
      affective episodes within one year of the illness. It has been postulated that
      rapid cycling is related with a poor response to lithium, to the same extent as
      mixed episodes or an atypical onset (depressive episode first) of the disease.
      Here, the current status of alternative pharmacological and supportive therapy of
      rapid cycling is presented and discussed. Furthermore, the article also displays 
      biological parameters associated with rapid cycling like higher prevalence in
      women, hypothyreoidism, subtype of bipolar disorder, COMT-allele, influence of
      sleep or risk of antidepressant induced cycling.

TI  - Antipsychotics and the risk of sudden cardiac death.
PG  - 1161-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Case reports link antipsychotic drugs with sudden cardiac deaths,
      which is consistent with dose-related electrophysiologic effects. Because this
      association has not been confirmed in controlled studies, we conducted a
      retrospective cohort study in Tennessee Medicaid enrollees, which included many
      antipsychotic users; there were also computer files describing medication use and
      comorbidity. The study was conducted before the introduction of risperidone and, 
      thus, did not include the newer atypical agents. METHODS: The cohort included
      481,744 persons with 1,282,996 person-years of follow-up. This included 26,749
      person-years for current moderate-dose antipsychotic use (>100-mg thioridazine
      equivalents), 31,864 person-years for current low-dose antipsychotic use, 37,881 
      person-years for use in the past year only, and 1 186,501 person-years for no
      use. The cohort had 1487 confirmed sudden cardiac deaths; from these, we
      calculated multivariate rate ratios adjusted for potential confounding factors.
      RESULTS: When current moderate-dose antipsychotic use was compared with nonuse,
      the multivariate rate ratio was 2.39 (95% confidence interval, 1.77-3.22;
      P<.001). This was greater than that for current low-dose (rate ratio, 1.30; 95%
      confidence interval, 0.98-1.72; P=.003) and former (rate ratio, 1.20; 95%
      confidence interval, 0.91-1.58; P<.001) use. Among cohort members with severe
      cardiovascular disease, current moderate-dose users had a 3.53-fold (95%
      confidence interval, 1.66-7.51) increased rate relative to comparable nonusers ( 
      P<.001), resulting in 367 additional deaths per 10,000 person-years of follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients prescribed moderate doses of antipsychotics had large
      relative and absolute increases in the risk of sudden cardiac death. Although the
      study data cannot demonstrate causality, they suggest that the potential adverse 
      cardiac effects of antipsychotics should be considered in clinical practice,
      particularly for patients with cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Clozapine-associated diabetes.
PG  - 716-23
AB  - Clozapine is a potent antipsychotic agent that has been marketed since 1990.
      Several published reports of diabetes mellitus occurring with clozapine therapy
      have appeared during the past 5 years. Because the risk and characteristics of
      clozapine-associated diabetes mellitus remain unclear, we conducted a descriptive
      epidemiologic study of spontaneous adverse event reports of hyperglycemia
      occurring in clozapine-treated patients. The Food and Drug Administration
      MedWatch surveillance program was queried (January 1990 through February 2001),
      and the results were pooled with published cases. Parameters assessed included
      documentation of diabetes, clinical severity, new-onset diabetes versus
      exacerbation of preexisting disease, demographic characteristics of patients,
      time to onset of hyperglycemia, and effect of drug discontinuation and
      rechallenge. We identified 384 reports. Of these, new-onset diabetes was
      diagnosed definitively in 242 patients, and 54 patients had exacerbation of
      preexisting disease. The mean (+/- SD) age was 40 +/- 12 years (range, 13 to 77).
      The male:female ratio was 2:0. Most cases appeared within 6 months of initiating 
      clozapine therapy. One patient developed diabetes following a single 500-mg dose.
      There were 80 cases of metabolic acidosis or ketosis. Twenty-five patients died
      during hyperglycemic episodes. Forty-six patients had improved glycemic control
      after discontinuation or dose reduction of the drug.A causal relationship between
      clozapine and diabetes is suggested by the number of reports, the temporal
      relation to clozapine initiation, the relatively young age of the affected
      patients, and the prompt reversibility on withdrawal of the drug in some
      patients. The severity of reported cases ranged from mild glucose intolerance to 
      diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma.

TI  - Pharmacoeconomic evaluation of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a 
      cost-utility analysis.
PG  - 199-206
AB  - The high costs and efficacy of clozapine warrant a systematic pharmacoeconomic
      evaluation to assess its relative cost-utility compared with that of older
      antipsychotic therapies. An economic analysis of clozapine consisted of a
      meta-analysis and a cost-utility analysis. Clozapine was compared with
      haloperidol and chlorpromazine. An incidence-based deterministic decision
      analysis was used to model the management of chronic schizophrenia over one year.
      Probabilities of clinical outcomes were obtained from a random effects, single
      arm meta-analysis. Utility weights were evaluated in a cohort of patients by
      using a standard gamble methodology. A government payer perspective was adopted
      for this analysis. Clozapine was the dominant therapy in this analysis because it
      was associated with the lowest overall expected cost and highest expected number 
      of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Compared with chlorpromazine, clozapine
      might save $38,879/year while producing 0.04 more QALYs. This analysis was
      limited in that studies were of short duration, the sample size for health
      utility analysis was small and the analysis was based on a model. Clozapine
      appears to be a very cost effective therapy in patients with treatment-resistant 
      schizophrenia compared with haloperidol and chlorpromazine.

TI  - Arithmetic fact retrieval and working memory in schizophrenia.
PG  - 219-27
AB  - Despite its importance in every-day life and vocational rehabilitation,
      arithmetic ability has rarely been investigated in schizophrenic patients. Those 
      few studies reporting arithmetic deficits in schizophrenia, however, administered
      complex calculation tasks which drew not only on arithmetic abilities, but also
      on working memory resources known to be impaired in schizophrenia. In the present
      study, arithmetic abilities and working memory functions were investigated in
      schizophrenic patients (n=24) and healthy control subjects (n=24). Arithmetic
      fact retrieval was assessed in single-digit multiplication and corresponding
      division problems using a result verification task which minimized working memory
      demands. Problem size and the disparity of the proposed result were manipulated. 
      The storage component of working memory was tested with a digit span forward task
      and the executive control component with a digit span backward as well as with
      verbal fluency tasks. Schizophrenic patients performed worse than controls only
      in the executive tasks. Digit span forward was preserved. In the arithmetic
      tasks, groups did not differ from each other, and a similar pattern of task
      manipulations was obtained. Hence, despite the executive control deficit
      retrieval of arithmetic facts is preserved in schizophrenia. Moreover, the same
      underlying cognitive processes as in control subjects are involved.

TI  - Amisulpride: a review of its use in the management of schizophrenia.
PG  - 2123-50
AB  - Amisulpride, a substituted benzamide derivative, is a second-generation
      (atypical) antipsychotic. At low doses, it enhances dopaminergic
      neurotransmission by preferentially blocking presynaptic dopamine D2/D3
      autoreceptors. At higher doses, amisupride antagonises postsynaptic dopamine D2
      and D3 receptors, preferentially in the limbic system rather than the striatum,
      thereby reducing dopaminergic transmission. In patients with acute exacerbations 
      of schizophrenia, the recommended dosage of amisulpride is 400 to 800 mg/day,
      although dosages < or =1200 mg/day may be administered. In comparative trials,
      amisulpride administered within this range (400 to 1200 mg/day) was as effective 
      as haloperidol 5 to 40 mg/day, flupenthixol 25 mg/day and risperidone 8 mg/day in
      patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia with predominantly positive
      symptoms. Amisulpride was more effective than haloperidol but equally effective
      as risperidone in controlling negative symptoms. Amisulpride 400 to 800 mg/day
      was more effective than haloperidol, risperidone and flupenthixol in controlling 
      affective symptoms in these patients. In randomised, double-blind trials
      involving patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia,
      amisulpride 50 to 300 mg/day was more effective than placebo. Amisulpride is
      effective as maintenance therapy in patients with chronic schizophrenia.
      Long-term treatment with amisulpride was associated with improvements in quality 
      of life and social functioning. Amisulpride is generally well tolerated. In
      well-controlled trials, the neurological tolerability profile (including ratings 
      on extrapyramidal symptom scales) of amisulpride 400 to 1200 mg/day was superior 
      to that of the conventional antipsychotics (haloperidol or flupenthixol), but was
      similar to that of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. At low dosages of
      amisulpride (< or =300 mg/day), the incidence of adverse events (including
      extrapyramidal symptoms) reported with amisulpride was similar to that with
      placebo. CONCLUSION: In comparative trials, amisulpride 400 to 1200 mg/day showed
      efficacy in reducing overall symptomatology and positive symptoms similar to that
      of conventional antipsychotics and newer atypical antipsychotics in patients with
      acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Moreover, its effective alleviation of
      negative and affective symptoms, its lower association with extrapyramidal
      symptoms and loss of cognitive function than conventional antipsychotics and its 
      long-term efficacy justifies consideration of the use of higher dosages of
      amisulpride in this group of patients. Consequently, the dosage of amisulpride
      that is recommended in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia is 400 
      to 800 mg/day, although dosages < or =1200 mg/day may be administered. Lower
      dosages of amisulpride (50 to 300 mg/day) should be considered for the management
      of patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Amisulpride is a first-line 
      treatment option in the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for
      the maintenance of treatment response.

TI  - First vs multiple episode schizophrenia: two-year outcome of intermittent and
      maintenance medication strategies.
PG  - 145-59
AB  - Results of studies on intermittent neuroleptic treatment strategies in first
      episode (FE) schizophrenia have not been published. Aims of the present study
      were to elucidate the comparative efficacy of prodrome-based neuroleptic
      intervention in first vs multiple episode (ME) schizophrenia. As to the methods, 
      three randomly assigned open neuroleptic treatment strategies were compared over 
      2 years in 363 schizophrenic outpatients (115 FE, 248 ME; ICD-9, RDC):
      maintenance medication vs two intermittent medication strategies (prodrome-based 
      intervention and crisis intervention). Concerning relapse prevention, the results
      demonstrate that ME patients seemed to profit most from maintenance medication
      compared to both intermittent treatments, whereas FE patients did equally well
      under maintenance medication and prodrome-based intervention treatment.
      Psychopathology, social adjustment, subjective well-being, and side-effects after
      two years did not differ significantly between the FE and ME patients
      irrespective of treatment strategy. Concerning treatment adherence, FE patients
      complied better with prodrome-based intervention than with maintenance
      medication. Cumulative neuroleptic dosage was lowest in FE patients under
      intermittent treatment. In conclusion, maintenance medication is the best
      strategy for relapse prevention in ME patients. In FE patients, prodrome-based
      intermittent intervention seems to be equivalent or even better with respect to
      compliance and dosage applied.

TI  - Latent inhibition deficits in high-schizotypal normals: symptom-specific or
      anxiety-related?
PG  - 109-21
AB  - Latent inhibition (LI) is the phenomenon in which subjects who have repeatedly
      experienced an irrelevant stimulus perform more poorly on a new learning task
      with that stimulus than with a novel stimulus, presumably because of a decline in
      stimulus-specific attention. The present article reviews the literature on LI
      deficits in high-schizotypal normal subjects and schizophrenic patients. Although
      LI-deficits have been thought to be specific to these groups, evidence is
      presented that the effects may be related to the anxiety components of
      high-schizotypality and related pathologies.

TI  - Euglycemic clamp study in clozapine-induced diabetic ketoacidosis.
PG  - 1381-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the fifth case of clozapine-induced diabetic ketoacidosis 
      (DKA) with complete resolution of abnormal glucose metabolism after
      discontinuation of clozapine as assessed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT)
      and the first to be serially studied with markers of pancreatic autoimmunity; to 
      demonstrate insulin resistance using the euglycemic clamp study and reduced
      pancreatic insulin reserve using intravenous glucose tolerance testing (IVGTT) in
      clozapine-induced diabetes mellitus and DKA, when the OGTT was normal; and to
      systematically review the previously described cases of clozapine-induced
      diabetes mellitus and DKA. CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old white man without past or 
      family history of diabetes mellitus presented with DKA after eight months of
      clozapine therapy (50 mg twice daily). After treatment of DKA and discontinuation
      of clozapine, glucose tolerance and concurrent serum insulin concentrations
      reverted to normal as measured by two OGTT performed 60 and 320 days after
      resolution of DKA. DISCUSSION: Antiislet-cell antibodies, antiglutamic acid
      decarboxylase antibodies, and human insulin antibody were negative on two
      separate occasions. Euglycemic clamp study demonstrated insulin resistance
      manifested by a glucose disposal rate of approximately 55% of mean normal values.
      IVGTT demonstrated a low rate of glucose disappearance (KG = 0.95) and diminished
      first-phase insulin response when OGTT was normal, indicating impairment in
      insulin sensitivity and reduction in beta cell function 323 days after
      discontinuance of clozapine. This adverse reaction is considered probable
      according to the Naranjo probability scale. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of cases 
      of DKA and new or worsening diabetes mellitus in patients using clozapine
      suggests a causal relationship. We hypothesize that the mechanism by which
      clozapine may produce glucose intolerance may require a preexisting latent defect
      in insulin secretion and insulin action. With the administration of clozapine,
      some of these patients may develop worsening insulin resistance and may fail to
      mount an appropriate compensatory beta cell insulin secretion for the degree of
      insulin resistance. As a consequence, hyperglycemia develops and its persistence 
      results in glucose toxicity, further suppressing beta cell insulin secretion.
      Such combined defects in insulin secretion and sensitivity are known to be
      synergistic, leading to the development of abnormal glucose tolerance, which can 
      be clinically manifested as a spectrum ranging from impaired glucose tolerance
      through severe hyperglycemia to DKA. Patients being started on clozapine should
      be carefully followed for the development or worsening of diabetes mellitus,
      regardless of the dose of the drug.

TI  - Agranulocytosis and granulocytopenia associated with quetiapine.
PG  - 311-3; discussion 313-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Quetiapine is a recently introduced atypical antipsychotic. Although
      adverse effects are mainly mild, more serious infrequent adverse effects
      including leucopenia are mentioned. METHOD: We describe three case-reports
      concerning haematological adverse effects of quetiapine. RESULTS: Quetiapine was 
      associated with leucopenia in two patients and clinically apparent
      agranulocytosis in one patient. CONCLUSION: Although a definite association has
      not been proven, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of agranulocytosis
      while using quetiapine. Further post-marketing surveys are required.

TI  - 5-HT(1A) receptor dysfunction in female patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 758-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serotonin (5-HT)(1A) receptors are of interest in the pathophysiology
      of schizophrenia (SCH) and the mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic
      drugs. To test the hypothesis that 5-HT(1A) receptor responsivity is
      significantly different in patients with SCH compared to normal control subjects,
      the neuroendocrine study was performed using ipsapirone (IPS), a 5-HT(1A) partial
      agonist, as a probe. METHODS: Ipsapirone 0.5 mg/kg, p.o. or placebo were
      administered, in random order, to patients with SCH (n = 43; 32 male) and normal 
      controls (n = 33; 21 male). Blood samples for plasma cortisol and body
      temperature were obtained from 30 min before to 180 min after administration of
      IPS or placebo. RESULTS: Female normal control subjects had markedly greater
      increases in plasma cortisol following IPS than did male control subjects. The
      placebo response-corrected plasma cortisol response to IPS was significantly
      blunted in female SCH compared to female normal control subjects (p =.0001). The 
      IPS-stimulated plasma cortisol response in male SCH did not differ from that of
      male normal control subjects or female SCH. There were no significant differences
      in the IPS-induced hypothermia in men and women or between patients with SCH and 
      normal control subjects. Behavioral responses to IPS, including nausea,
      dizziness, irritability, and feeling less well, did not differ between groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the post-synaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor
      mediated endocrine response is diminished in female SCH compared to female normal
      control subjects, possibly secondary to an abnormality in intracellular signal
      transduction mechanism.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic
      inpatients with schizophrenia: a randomized double-blind study.
PG  - 325-30
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of risperidone
      and haloperidol in treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenic patients. Subjects
      (n = 78) who met DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to
      receive 6 mg/day of risperidone or 20 mg/day of haloperidol for 12 weeks.
      Clinical efficacy was determined using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS), and side-effects with the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS).
      Risperidone produced a mean 39.8 +/- 24.1% reduction in total PANSS score
      compared to a mean 28.3 + 19.4% reduction in the haloperidol group (P < 0.05).
      Analysis of changes for the three subscores of the PANSS revealed that the
      general psychopathology and negative subscores were significantly improved in the
      risperidone group compared to the haloperidol group. As for the side-effects, the
      risperidone group showed a significantly lower TESS total score, as well as
      nervous system symptoms subscore and cardiovascular symptoms subscore, compared
      to the haloperidol group. Risperidone appears to be a more effective and better
      tolerated antipsychotic drug in treatment-refractory Chinese schizophrenia than
      haloperidol.

TI  - Effects of risperidone on aberrant behavior of persons with developmental
      disabilities: I. A double-blind crossover study using multiple measures.
PG  - 525-38
AB  - The efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone was evaluated in the
      treatment of aberrant behavior (e.g., aggression, self-injury) in 20 individuals 
      with developmental disabilities. A double-blind, crossover design was used to
      compare risperidone with placebo in a 22-week trial with a 6-month follow-up
      phase. Based on a 50% reduction in mean Aberrant Behavior Checklist--Community
      total scores, 50% of the participants were identified as responders. Naturalistic
      observations of a subset of five individuals showed that for 4 out of 5
      participants, risperidone was effective in reducing aberrant behavior. Side
      effects included weight gain (84% of participants) and sedation (40% of
      participants). The advantages of conducting a comprehensive analysis of the
      effects of medication on aberrant behavior are discussed.

TI  - Olanzapine: a review of its use in the treatment of bipolar I disorder.
PG  - 871-904
AB  - Olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine derivative, is a psychotropic agent that has
      shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder. Olanzapine
      has a multireceptorial binding profile including a greater affinity for serotonin
      5-HT(2A) than for dopamine D(2) receptors. Olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day demonstrated
      significantly greater antimanic efficacy than placebo in two double-blind,
      randomised 3- or 4-week trials of patients with bipolar I disorder of either
      manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features. Additionally, in one
      of these trials, improvements in cognitive function and hostility were superior
      with olanzapine. In cohorts of severely depressed and rapid cycling patients,
      improvements in manic and depressive symptoms and in manic symptoms only, were
      superior with olanzapine compared with placebo. Significant improvements from
      baseline in symptoms of mania, depression, cognitive functioning and hostility
      were seen with olanzapine in a 49-week extension phase study. In double-blind
      trials, olanzapine 10 mg/day appeared to have similar antimanic efficacy to oral 
      lithium 400mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with pure mania (4-week
      small study). In patients with acute manic or mixed episodes olanzapine 5 to 20
      mg/day appeared to be more effective than oral valproate semisodium (divalproex
      sodium) 500 to 2500 mg/day (3-week study) and at least as effective as oral
      haloperidol 3 to 15 mg/day (12-week study). Preliminary results from a large
      6-week placebo-controlled study suggest that olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day in
      combination with mood stabilisers (lithium or valproate semisodium) provides
      effective augmentation of antimanic treatment of patients with bipolar I
      disorder, with benefits seen in the first week. Adverse events reported
      significantly more often with olanzapine than with placebo were somnolence, dry
      mouth, dizziness and bodyweight gain, and in comparison with valproate semisodium
      were somnolence, dry mouth, increased appetite and bodyweight gain. Olanzapine
      was generally well tolerated with no clinically relevant abnormalities in
      laboratory tests, vital signs or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSION:
      Olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy compared with placebo in the short-term
      treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes, with 
      or without psychotic features, and was generally well tolerated. According to
      preliminary data the antimanic efficacy of olanzapine appears similar to that of 
      haloperidol and better than that of valproate semisodium in patients with bipolar
      I disorder experiencing a manic or mixed episode; among nonpsychotic patients
      with manic or mixed episodes olanzapine appears to be superior to haloperidol.
      Available data support the choice of olanzapine as an option in the short-term
      management of mania in patients with bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed
      episodes, with or without psychotic features.

TI  - Clinical outcome following neuroleptic discontinuation in patients with remitted 
      recent-onset schizophrenia.
PG  - 1835-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this report was to examine the clinical course following
      neuroleptic discontinuation of patients with recent-onset schizophrenia who had
      been receiving maintenance antipsychotic treatment for at least 1 year. METHOD:
      Fifty-three volunteer patients with recent-onset schizophrenia who had been
      clinically stabilized on a maintenance regimen of fluphenazine decanoate for a
      mean of 16.7 months had their antipsychotic medications withdrawn under clinical 
      supervision. Participants initially entered a 24-week, double-blind crossover
      trial in which fluphenazine and placebo were administered for 12 weeks each. For 
      those who did not experience symptom exacerbation or relapse during this period, 
      fluphenazine was openly withdrawn; participants were then followed for up to 18
      additional months. RESULTS: When a low threshold for defining symptom reemergence
      was used, 78% (N=39 of 50) of the patients experienced an exacerbation or relapse
      within 1 year; 96% (N=48 of 50) did so within 2 years. Mean time to exacerbation 
      or relapse was 235 days. When hospitalization was used as a relapse criterion,
      only six of 45 of individuals (13%) experiencing an exacerbation or relapse who
      continued in treatment in the clinic were hospitalized, demonstrating the
      sensitivity of the psychotic exacerbation criterion. CONCLUSIONS: The vast
      majority of clinically stable individuals with recent-onset schizophrenia will
      experience an exacerbation or relapse after antipsychotic discontinuation, even
      after more than a year of maintenance medication. However, clinical monitoring
      and a low threshold for reinstating medications can prevent hospitalization for
      the majority of these patients.

      pointes and sudden death with antipsychotic drugs. METHOD: They present a review 
      of original concepts, the distinction between familial and drug-induced cases of 
      torsade de pointes, and the recognition of the role of noncardiac drugs in
      torsade de pointes and sudden death. They review the evidence linking QTc
      interval prolongation, potassium channels, and torsade de pointes from both the
      long QT syndrome and drugs. They examine the risk for torsade de pointes from
      antipsychotic drugs and estimate the frequency of sudden death on the basis of
      epidemiological data in normal and schizophrenic populations. RESULTS: All drugs 
      that cause torsade de pointes prolong the QTc interval and bind to the potassium 
      rectifier channel, but the relationships are not precise. Prediction of torsade
      de pointes and sudden death can be improved by examining dose dependency, the
      percent of QTc intervals higher than 500 msec, and the risk of drug-drug
      interactions. Although sudden unexpected death occurs almost twice as often in
      populations treated with antipsychotics as in normal populations, there are still
      only 10-15 such events in 10,000 person-years of observation. CONCLUSIONS:
      Although pimozide, sertindole, droperidol, and haloperidol have been documented
      to cause torsade de pointes and sudden death, the most marked risk is with
      thioridazine. There is no association with olanzapine, quetiapine, or
      risperidone. Ziprasidone does prolong the QT interval, but there is no evidence
      to suggest that this leads to torsade de pointes or sudden death. Only widespread
      use will prove if ziprasidone is entirely safe. To date, all antipsychotic drugs 
      have the potential for serious adverse events. Balancing these risks with the
      positive effects of treatment poses a challenge for psychiatry.

TI  - Effects of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol on hostility among
      patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 1510-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the specific antiaggressive effects of clozapine
      with those of olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol. METHODS: A total of 157
      inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and a history of
      suboptimal treatment response were randomly assigned to receive clozapine,
      olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol in a double-blind 14-week trial. The
      trial was divided into two periods: eight weeks during which the dosage was
      escalated and then fixed, and six weeks during which variable dosages were used. 
      The hostility item of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was the
      principal outcome measure. Covariates included the items that reflect positive
      symptoms of schizophrenia (delusions, suspiciousness or feelings of persecution, 
      grandiosity, unusual thought content, conceptual disorganization, and
      hallucinations) and the sedation item of the Nurses Observation Scale for
      Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE). RESULTS: Patients differed in their treatment
      response as measured by the hostility item of the PANSS. The scores of patients
      taking clozapine indicated significantly greater improvement than those of
      patients taking haloperidol or risperidone. The effect on hostility appeared to
      be independent of the antipsychotic effect of clozapine on other PANSS items that
      reflect delusional thinking, a formal thought disorder, or hallucinations and
      independent of sedation as measured by the NOSIE. Neither risperidone nor
      olanzapine showed superiority to haloperidol. CONCLUSION: Clozapine has a
      relative advantage over other antipsychotics as a specific antihostility agent.

TI  - The effects of olanzapine on neurocognitive functioning in medication-refractory 
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 239-50
AB  - Neurocognitive deficits are an enduring characteristic of schizophrenia, and
      remain prominent in patients whose positive symptoms have decreased after
      treatment with typical neuroleptics. Recent research has reported that olanzapine
      improves cognitive functioning in relapsing schizophrenia followed in an
      outpatient setting. Whether olanzapine will have an effect on improving cognitive
      function in chronic schizophrenics who have been hospitalized for long periods of
      time, and have shown a poor response to other conventional and atypical
      neuroleptics, has not been established. This study investigated cognitive
      function in chronic medication refractory schizophrenics who were treated with
      olanzapine or haloperidol in a double-blind study for 8 wk, and followed in an
      open olanzapine study for several additional months. Patients were evaluated with
      psychopathology rating scales and a battery of neuropsychological tests at
      baseline, end of double-blind and end of open-label phases of the study. At the
      end of the double-blind phase there were no significant differences between
      olanzapine and haloperidol, except for a trend for improvement on the Wisconsin
      Card Sort Test on olanzapine, which was significant at traditional but not
      corrected significance levels. After an additional 3 months of treatment with
      olanzapine doses of 20-40 mg/d, our statistical analysis showed significant
      improvement on overall neuropsychological test performance and specific cognitive
      tasks assessing verbal memory. However, these open-label results are difficult to
      interpret definitively because of the lack of a comparison drug group and the
      olanzapine dose escalation over time. Neurocognitive changes were not correlated 
      with changes in psychopathology as assessed by PANSS or SANS scores.

TI  - A follow-up study of a population of schizophrenic patients treated with
      clozapine.
PG  - 1481-95
AB  - 1. Clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine neuroleptic which presents the advantage of
      not having undesirable neurological side-effects. Its efficacy for the treatment 
      of the symptoms of schizophrenia is known, but the use of clozapine is limited to
      treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients as it induces agranulocytosis with a
      higher incidence than that of other neuroleptic drugs. 2. The present study was
      designed in order to evaluate the benefit/risk of chronic treatment. The analysis
      was performed using the files of schizophrenic patients. These patients were not 
      stabilized by a classical neuroleptic treatment and/or presented individual
      secondary effects. 3. Clozapine induced neutropenia and 1 case of agranulocytosis
      in 3 females. Analysis of leukocyte expression highlighted some premonitory
      symptoms in patients who presented neutropenia. The observation of 2 to 3 early
      successive peaks in leukocyte expression (between the third and tenth week of
      treatment) could be predictive of neutropenia in the 3 to 4 months of treatment. 
      4. The patients who presented a lower leukocyte base-line following a peak had a 
      higher risk, of developing neutropenia. This might explain some late accidents
      beyond the first six months of treatment. 5. The present study confirmed the
      advantages of clozapine treatment and demonstrated that the risk of neutropenia
      may be diminished by the detection of premonitory symptoms and the early
      monitoring of patients at risk i.e. female patients and subjects with a lower
      leukocyte base-line.

TI  - Fluvoxamine as an adjunctive agent in schizophrenia.
PG  - 283-304
AB  - Schizophrenia is a common mental disorder that has an early onset and rates high 
      as a cause of medical disability. Antipsychotic agents are the mainstay of
      treatment but response is often inadequate. Negative symptoms (disturbances in
      volition, social interaction and affective functions) are particularly difficult 
      to treat and form a major obstacle to rehabilitation. A promising approach to
      improve response of negative symptoms has been to add a selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant to antipsychotic treatment. This review 
      examines evidence pertaining to the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the
      SSRI fluvoxamine, combined with antipsychotic agents, in the treatment of
      negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Important methodological issues, such as
      differentiating primary and secondary negative symptoms, are discussed. The
      balance of available evidence indicates that fluvoxamine can improve primary
      negative symptoms in chronic schizophrenia patients treated with typical
      antipsychotics and suggests that it may also do so in some patients treated with 
      clozapine. This combination is generally safe and well tolerated although, as
      antipsychotic drug concentrations may be elevated, attention to dose and drug
      monitoring should be considered appropriately. Combination with clozapine may
      require particular caution because of potential toxicity if serum clozapine
      levels rise steeply. The fluvoxamine doses effective in augmentation are lower
      than those usually used to treat depression. Evidence regarding the use of
      fluvoxamine augmentation to treat phenomena, such as obsessions and aggression,
      which may be associated with schizophrenia, is also examined. An important goal
      of future studies will be to define which patient groups can benefit from
      combined treatment.

TI  - Autonomic responses of blood vessels and sweat glands in patients with
      schizophrenia treated with olanzapine or clozapine.
PG  - 368-72
AB  - RATIONALE: Data comparing the in vivo effects on autonomic nervous system
      function of standard clinical doses of olanzapine and clozapine are sparse.
      OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare the skin conductance response
      (which is peripherally mediated via muscarinic m3-receptors) and the inspiratory 
      gasp response (which is peripherally mediated via adrenergic receptors) between
      healthy controls and schizophrenics treated with clozapine or olanzapine.
      METHODS: Twenty patients with schizophrenia (according to DSM-III-R criteria)
      treated with either clozapine (200-500 mg/day) or olanzapine (10-20 mg/day) as
      well as ten matched controls underwent simultaneous recordings of the skin
      conductance response (SCR) of sweat glands and of the inspiratory gasp response
      (IGR) of acral blood vessels. A single, deep inspiration was used as the
      stimulus. Group differences for the SCR amplitudes and the post-IGR redilation
      times were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Both clozapine- and
      olanzapine-treated patients showed a significant SCR reduction compared to
      controls. Interestingly, the reduction in SCR was significantly larger in the
      clozapine group compared to the olanzapine group (P<0.05). Moreover, only
      clozapine-treated patients showed a statistical trend towards a longer IGR
      redilation time compared to controls. CONCLUSION: The significantly stronger SCR 
      reduction amongst clozapine-treated compared to olanzapine-treated patients
      suggests that olanzapine at a standard clinical dose exhibits a significantly
      smaller anticholinergic effect at peripheral m3-receptors in vivo compared to
      clozapine. The prolongation of IGR redilation can be explained by a prolonged
      release of noradrenaline due to the alpha2-antagonistic effect of clozapine.

      schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 236-42
AB  - RATIONALE: Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using (123)I
      iodobenzamide (IBZM) as tracer substance has been shown to be a useful tool to
      visualize dopamine 2 (D2) receptor occupancy. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the
      striatal D2 receptor occupancy of zotepine which is referred to the class of
      atypical antipsychotic drugs. METHODS: (123)I IBZM and SPECT were used to
      visualize striatal dopamine 2 (D2) receptor occupancy in zotepine-treated
      schizophrenic patients. Two groups of schizophrenic patients receiving either 150
      mg/day zotepine (n=6) or 300 mg/day (n=6) underwent examination. For the
      quantification of striatal D2 receptor occupancy, striatal IBZM binding in
      patients treated with antipsychotics was compared to untreated healthy controls
      (n=8) reported earlier. RESULTS: Zotepine led to a mean overall striatal D2
      receptor occupancy of 73%. Patients with 150 mg daily showed a significantly
      lower occupancy (65.8%, SD=6.2) than patients with 300 mg/day (77.8%, SD=10.7;
      P<0.05). No clinically relevant extrapyramidal side effects occurred during
      treatment with zotepine. CONCLUSIONS: There was no correlation between the degree
      of striatal D2 receptor occupancy and clinical improvement.

TI  - A placebo-controlled pilot study of the ampakine CX516 added to clozapine in
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 484-7
AB  - CX516, a positive modulator of the glutamatergic
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor, improves
      performance in tasks requiring learning and memory in animals. CX516 was added to
      clozapine in 4-week, placebo-controlled, dose-finding (N = 6) and fixed-dose (N =
      13) trials. CX516 was tolerated well and was associated with moderate to large,
      between-group effect sizes compared with placebo, representing improvement in
      measures of attention and memory. These preliminary results suggest that CX516
      and other "ampakines" hold promise for the treatment of schizophrenia.

TI  - Clozapine enhances neurocognition and clinical symptomatology more than standard 
      neuroleptics.
PG  - 479-83
AB  - Neurocognition and clinical symptomatology were evaluated in 27 patients with
      schizophrenia during a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study
      involving clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent, and haloperidol, a
      conventional neuroleptic. Patients were assessed 5 to 6 weeks after initiation of
      each phase. Clinical symptomatology, based on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and 
      Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms ratings, markedly improved after
      treatment with both haloperidol and clozapine. The beneficial effects of
      clozapine were statistically significantly greater than the effects from the
      haloperidol treatment. Regarding neurocognition, both agents proved efficacious
      in improving performance on nearly all measures compared with placebo. In
      addition, as compared with haloperidol, clozapine significantly improved
      performance on Trails B, Verbal Fluency, and measures of delayed verbal memory,
      and it tended to increase performance on most measures. Additional analyses
      indicated that the improvement on neurocognitive measures was not because of
      symptom amelioration; rather, neurocognitive deficits seem to be an intrinsic
      enduring feature of schizophrenia. The superiority of clozapine over haloperidol 
      may be related to clozapine's unique psychopharmacologic profile.

TI  - Use of the Medication Event Monitoring System to estimate medication compliance
      in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 325-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of using the Medication Event Monitoring 
      System (MEMS) to estimate medication compliance in patients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Fourteen of 35 consecutive
      patients admitted to a psychiatric inpatient hospital with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder who met eligibility requirements and gave informed
      consent. INTERVENTION: After random assignment to either risperidone or typical
      antipsychotic treatment, medication upon discharge from hospital was dispensed in
      a bottle with a MEMS cap which recorded the number of bottle openings and the
      date and time of each opening. The first 6 patients were asked to return monthly 
      for data downloading. The next 8 were asked to return weekly during the first
      month and every 2 weeks thereafter; they were also paid $5 for returning each
      bottle. OUTCOME MEASURES: MEMS data collected over a 6-month period and hospital 
      readmission data. RESULTS: Patient medication compliance data were collected from
      10 (71%) of 14 patients during the first month, from 7 (58%) of 12 (2 patients
      dropped out) during the second and from 5 (45%) of 11 (a third patient dropped
      out) during months 3-6. Mean compliance rates were 63% for the first month and
      ranged from 56% to 45% over the next 5. First-month compliance rates were
      significantly lower for those who were subsequently readmitted to hospital (n =
      7) than for those who were not (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Electronic monitoring
      devices can be used to estimate compliance with medication regimens in patients
      with severe schizophrenic disorders, but there are methodological improvements
      that can be made to increase data recovery and compliance, and these are
      discussed.

TI  - New antidepressive and antipsychotic drugs in juvenile neuronal ceroid
      lipofuscinoses--a pilot study.
PG  - 163-6
AB  - Patients with juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) often have severe
      psychiatric symptoms. These are common in their mid-teens and include such
      symptoms as anxiety and affective and psychotic disorders. The older
      antidepressants and antipsychotics do not seem to be effective and often cause
      many adverse effects. Therefore, we wanted to try the new psychotropic drugs in
      Finnish patients with JNCL. We also wanted to determine the profile of these
      drugs in this patient group. Fourteen Finnish patients with JNCL receiving
      psychotropic drug treatment with citalopram, risperidone, olanzapine or
      quetiapine, were included. The mean age at initiation of the new psychotropic
      drugs was 13.8 years. Indications for treatment were psychotic symptoms,
      affective symptoms, anxiety and an inadequate response to other psychotropic
      drugs, or even adverse reactions. Information on psychiatric symptoms and current
      treatment was gathered from interviews and from the medical records. Indications 
      and the clinical outcome of the treatment were determined by a consensus of the
      assessments by parents and physicians. The psychotropic drugs most commonly used 
      in Finnish patients with JNCL are citalopram and risperidone. The clinical
      outcome was good or satisfactory in 70%. The adverse effects most commonly
      reported were fatigue, weight gain and aggravation of extrapyramidal symptoms.
      Little research has been done in this area and there are no good guidelines for
      treatment of psychiatric symptoms in patients with JNCL. Therefore, every patient
      should be treated with the safest and most commonly used drugs in the lowest
      possible doses.

TI  - Ziprasidone: a new atypical antipsychotic.
PG  - 1033-42
AB  - This paper reviews the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety of the new
      atypical antipsychotic, ziprasidone. All published citations regarding
      ziprasidone were retrieved and reviewed using a MEDLINE search (completed for
      citations to early 2001). In addition, abstracts from recent scientific meetings 
      presenting data not yet published were reviewed. Like other new antipsychotic
      medications, ziprasidone fits the profile of an atypical agent, exerting efficacy
      in positive and negative symptoms of psychosis, as well as affective symptoms,
      with a low risk of neurological and neuroendocrinological side effects. Unlike
      newer agents, it does not appear to be associated with weight gain in most
      patients.

TI  - Association of olanzapine-induced weight gain with an increase in body fat.
PG  - 1719-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to explore the pathophysiology of weight
      gain during treatment with olanzapine for schizophrenia. METHOD: The authors used
      a prospective, controlled, open study comparing body weight, body mass index, and
      related biological measures in mentally and physically healthy volunteers and
      olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. Weight, eating behavior, leptin
      serum levels, body mass index, and body composition were assessed over an 8-week 
      observation period. RESULTS: A significant increase in body weight, leptin serum 
      levels, and percentage of body fat was seen in patients treated with olanzapine, 
      but the drug-free comparison group did not show any significant changes. The
      weight gain during antipsychotic treatment with olanzapine was mainly
      attributable to an increase in body fat; patients' lean body mass did not change.
      CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the original finding that an increase in body fat is 
      mainly responsible for olanzapine-induced weight gain, these findings confirm
      results obtained in other studies showing increases in body weight and serum
      leptin levels during treatment with second-generation antipsychotics.

TI  - Use of olanzapine in dysphoric mania.
PG  - 247-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: The simultaneous presentation of both manic and depressive symptoms
      has long been recognized. Nevertheless, a variable prevalence of dysphoric mania 
      has been reported. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of
      dysphoric mania among hospitalized patients and to assess the effectiveness of
      olanzapine in this type of patients. METHODS: Eighty-six patients who met DSM-IV 
      criteria for mania were evaluated at admission with a protocol that included
      McElroy's criteria for dysphoric mania [Am. J. Psychiatry 149 (1992) 1633].
      Treatment was administered according to clinical need, using mood stabilizers
      combined with antipsychotics. Sequential assessments were conducted throughout
      the study. RESULTS: Forty-four patients (51.2%) fulfilled McElroy's criteria for 
      dysphoric mania. Fourteen of these dysphoric patients were treated with
      olanzapine in combination with mood-stabilizers. All patients improved in manic
      symptoms but patients treated with olanzapine improved significantly more than
      those treated with other antipsychotics in depressive symptoms. LIMITATIONS: The 
      lack of randomization is a methodological limitation of this study, so these
      findings should be considered as preliminary. CONCLUSIONS: Dysphoric symptoms are
      common in this population of manic patients. Olanzapine in combination with
      mood-stabilizers may be effective in these patients. Additional controlled
      studies are needed to replicate these results.

TI  - Risperidone in the treatment of psychotic depression.
PG  - 335-7
AB  - Risperidone has been primarily marketed for the treatment of schizophrenia. There
      are reports about its potential role for the treatment of affective illness. We
      report here another case of a patient with psychotic depression who was treated
      successfully with risperidone as monotherapy. This case report suggests that
      risperidone can be an efficient treatment mode for psychotic depression; however,
      it needs more data based on controlled study.

TI  - Risperidone added to clozapine: impact on serum prolactin levels.
PG  - 605-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several years ago, we reported that the addition of risperidone to
      clozapine improved response in some patients with schizophrenia. Risperidone, in 
      general, is well tolerated when administered as monotherapy, but has been linked 
      to a persistent elevation of serum prolactin and associated symptoms. The goal of
      this study was to determine whether the addition of risperidone to clozapine
      results in an elevation of serum prolactin levels in patients with chronic
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. METHOD: Twenty patients on
      clozapine-risperidone combination therapy were matched for age and gender with 20
      patients treated with clozapine monotherapy. Demographic information was gathered
      along with clozapine and risperidone dose and the length of time on risperidone. 
      Serum prolactin levels were measured from a single blood sample. RESULTS: The 2
      groups did not differ in age, race, gender, diagnosis, age at clozapine
      initiation, age at onset, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores, or
      clozapine dose. The mean +/- SD serum prolactin level was 8.42+/-4.17 ng/mL for
      clozapine monotherapy patients and 35.76+/-17.43 ng/mL for combination therapy
      patients. The 2 medication categories showed a significant difference in log
      prolactin values (t = -7.97, df = 38, p < or = .0001). Sixteen combination
      therapy patients (80%) exhibited elevated prolactin levels (range for entire
      group, 9.7-69.8 ng/mL) while only 2 clozapine monotherapy patients (10%)
      exhibited prolactin elevation levels (range for entire group, 2.4-20.2 ng/mL; df 
      = 1, p < .0001). CONCLUSION: The combination of risperidone and clozapine appears
      to result in a moderate elevation of serum prolactin levels. Additionally,
      controlled prospective studies are needed to clarify the risks of long-term
      elevations of serum prolactin level.

TI  - Medication prescribing patterns for patients with bipolar I disorder in hospital 
      settings: adherence to published practice guidelines.
PG  - 165-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this paper were to examine the medication prescribing 
      patterns for bipolar I disorder in hospital settings and to compare them to
      recently published expert consensus guidelines for medication treatment of
      bipolar disorder. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 1996-2000 CQI+SM Outcomes 
      Measurement System, on patients age 18 or older admitted to psychiatric inpatient
      units from over 100 medical-surgical hospitals. A total of 1864 patients with a
      primary discharge diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder were identified from a
      large cohort of hospitalized patients. Patient characteristics were assessed at
      hospital admission and medication usage, at discharge. The medication analysis
      focused on the 1471 individuals with bipolar I mania or bipolar I depression
      (with or without psychotic features), representing 54% and 25% of admitted
      bipolar patients, respectively. RESULTS: At admission, the typical bipolar
      patient (mean age 57) had experienced a relatively severe and chronic course of
      illness. The array of psychotropic agents used was broad, with no single
      prescribing pattern predominant. Only one in three bipolar I (manic or depressed)
      patients with psychotic features was discharged on medications recommended by
      expert guidelines as preferred or alternate recommended treatment. Absent
      psychotic features, this dropped to one in six patients. Surprising was the
      relatively high use of antidepressants for patients with mania, particularly
      those without psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that a substantial
      proportion of patients with bipolar I disorder are discharged from hospitals on
      medications not generally recommended by current practice guidelines.

TI  - Treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia: a combined analysis of double-blind
      studies comparing risperidone with haloperidol and other antipsychotic agents.
PG  - 265-74
AB  - Combined data on efficacy were available from 12 double-blind short-term (maximum
      8 weeks) trials comparing risperidone and other antipsychotics in patients with
      chronic schizophrenia. Patients received risperidone (n = 1056) or other
      antipsychotics (n = 703). Haloperidol (n = 473) was the most frequently
      prescribed other antipsychotic. Efficacy assessments include the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, subscale (positive symptoms, negative
      symptoms and general psychopathology), cluster (cognitive and affective symptoms)
      and item (anxiety and hostility) scores. At endpoint, the mean decrease from
      baseline in PANSS total scores was significantly greater for patients receiving
      risperidone (-20.9) than other antipsychotics (-16.2; P < 0.001), or the subset
      receiving haloperidol (-14.3; P < 0.001). Risperidone-treated patients showed a
      significantly greater decrease in the positive (P < 0.01), negative (P < 0.05)
      and general psychopathology (P < 0.001) scores than patients receiving other
      antipsychotics or haloperidol. Scores for cognition, affective symptoms, anxiety 
      and hostility each improved significantly (P < 0.05) more for patients receiving 
      risperidone than those receiving other antipsychotics or haloperidol. Efficacy
      data on patients with an acute exacerbation were available from seven trials
      (risperidone n = 372, other antipsychotics n = 285, including haloperidol n =
      120). At endpoint, the mean decrease from baseline in PANSS total scores was
      significantly greater for patients receiving risperidone (-24.7) than other
      antipsychotics (-19.8, P < 0.01) including haloperidol (-19.8, P < 0.05).
      Risperidone-treated patients also showed a greater decrease in positive symptom
      scores (-7.8) than those receiving other antipsychotics (-6.3; P < 0.01) or
      haloperidol (-7.1). A > or = 20% reduction in PANSS total score with risperidone,
      haloperidol and other antipsychotics was achieved by 65.9%, 54.3% and 54.9%,
      respectively; a > or = 30% PANSS reduction by 54.0%, 46.6% and 46.5% of patients,
      respectively; and a > or = 40% reduction by 43.8%, 33.7% and 34.4% of patients,
      respectively. These findings are consistent with earlier findings that show
      risperidone is more efficacious than haloperidol for reducing the symptoms of
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes. Risperidone compared with low-
      and high-potency conventional antipsychotic drugs.
PG  - 327-31
AB  - AIM: To compare the risk of extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS) between patients using
      risperidone and those using low-potency conventional antipsychotic drugs (APDs)
      in outpatient clinical practice, as measured by the use of anticholinergic
      medication. We tried to replicate results from previous clinical trials that
      compared risperidone with high-potency APDs. METHOD: Data was obtained from the
      PHARMO database containing filled prescriptions of 450,000 community-dwelling
      people in The Netherlands from 1986 to 1998. From the patients aged 15-54 years
      who had been newly treated with APDs, we defined mutually exclusive cohorts
      according to the APD first prescribed to a patient. APD exposure was followed
      until the first prescription of anticholinergic medication and was censored when 
      APD prescribing was interrupted or switched. We estimated relative risks between 
      risperidone and commonly used low-potency and high-potency APDs using Cox
      proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, gender, dose and other potential 
      confounders. RESULTS: In 4094 patients who had been newly prescribed
      antipsychotic drugs, the overall incidence rate of anticholinergic drug therapy
      was 556 per 1000 person-years, which was dose dependent. Prescribed doses of all 
      antipsychotics were low. While, in accordance with previous trials, risperidone
      showed a lower risk of EPS than the high potency APDs such as haloperidol (RR
      0.26; 95% CI 0.10-0.64), we did not observe a lower EPS rate than low-potency
      APDs (risperidone vs thioridazine RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.49-6.13; risperidone vs
      pipamperone RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.78-8.04). CONCLUSION: The reduced EPS rates
      observed when comparing risperidone with high-potency antipsychotics such as
      haloperidol may not apply to comparisons with low-potency drugs.

TI  - Effects of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone on hostility and aggression in 
      schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of controlled trials.
PG  - 289-93
AB  - Atypical antipsychotics have been hypothesized to be more effective than
      classical antipsychotics in the treatment of hostility and aggression, due to
      their characteristic pharmacological profile, involving serotonergic as well as
      dopaminergic systems. In the present quantitative review the published evidence
      regarding the effects of risperidone on hostility and aggression in schizophrenia
      is evaluated. Meta-analysis of seven controlled trials revealed significant
      differences between risperidone and classical antipsychotics and between
      risperidone and placebo, although the effect size was small. Additional analyses 
      in which only methodological rigorous studies were included showed highly
      significant differences (risperidone versus classical antipsychotics) and the
      effect size approached the 'medium' range. We conclude that risperidone is
      superior to classical antipsychotics and placebo in the treatment of hostility
      and aggression in schizophrenia. Neuropharmacological mechanisms that might
      account for this effect are discussed, and directions for future research are
      outlined.

TI  - Abnormal thermoregulation in drug-free male schizophrenia patients.
PG  - 285-8
AB  - Schizophrenia patients may develop various thermoregulatory disturbances. We
      hypothesized that a standardized exercise-heat tolerance test [two 50-min bouts
      of walking a motor-driven treadmill at 40 degrees C (relative humidity=40%)]
      would reveal abnormal thermoregulation in drug-free schizophrenia patients. Six
      drug-free schizophrenia outpatients and seven healthy comparison subjects
      participated in this study. The schizophrenia patients exhibited significantly
      higher baseline and exertion-related rectal temperature. The relevance of these
      findings to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia-related thermoregulatory
      disorders is as yet unclear.

TI  - Neurotransmitters, temperament and social functioning.
PG  - 261-74
AB  - Dimensional models can be usefully employed to describe both normal and
      disordered personality. Studies in molecular genetics, receptor binding,
      peripheral monoamines and pharmacological challenges have investigated the
      neurochemical basis of personality. Substantial evidence now exists to support a 
      psychobiological model but the specificity of Cloninger's theory has not always
      been confirmed. Clinical studies have shown both temperament and character
      dimensions to improve with pharmacological treatment especially in treatment
      responders. Some personality changes are found to be independent of clinical
      effects and even to occur in normal subjects. Models of personality can help in
      predicting treatment outcome but individual dimensions may not be useful. It is
      hypothesised that social adaptation is related to the character dimensions and
      different sources of evidence link these to serotonergic actions. However, recent
      clinical studies have shown a specific effect of noradrenaline on self-perception
      and social motivation. Drugs with specific actions on different neurotransmitters
      may exert a distinctive pattern of effects on personality and social behaviour.

TI  - Double-blind olanzapine vs. haloperidol D2 dopamine receptor blockade in
      schizophrenic patients: a baseline-endpoint.
PG  - 87-97
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare in vivo striatal D2 dopamine receptor
      occupancy induced by olanzapine and haloperidol in schizophrenic patients using a
      baseline-endpoint [(123)I]IBZM single photon computed emission tomography (SPECT)
      design. The relationships of striatal D2 receptor occupancy with clinical
      efficacy and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were also assessed. Twenty-seven
      inpatients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder were included in a
      4-week prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel and comparative clinical
      trial. Thirteen patients were treated with haloperidol (10 mg/day) and 14 with
      olanzapine (10 mg/day). Ratings of clinical status and EPS were obtained weekly. 
      The percentage of D2 receptor occupancy was estimated by using basal ganglia
      (striatum)/frontal cortex IBZM uptake ratios obtained from each patient before
      and after 4 weeks of maintained antipsychotic treatment. Olanzapine led to a mean
      striatal D2 receptor occupancy of 49% (range 28-69%), which was significantly
      lower than that induced by haloperidol (mean 64%, range 46-90%). The
      baseline-endpoint SPECT design used in this study revealed lower antipsychotic D2
      occupancy percentage values than those reported in the literature, using other
      approaches. The degree of striatal D2 receptor occupancy correlated to the EPS,
      which predominantly appeared in patients on haloperidol. No relationship was
      found between the striatal D2 receptor occupancy and clinical improvement.
      Olanzapine induced a lower striatal D2 occupancy than haloperidol. This low
      striatal D2 occupancy, together with the lower incidence of EPS in
      olanzapine-treated patients, contributed to confirm the atypical behavior of this
      new antipsychotic drug. Nevertheless, conclusions based on SPECT-estimated
      percentages of antipsychotic D2 occupancy should be cautious, since the SPECT
      design could influence the results. In this regard, SPECT studies including
      baseline and endpoint examinations should be encouraged.

TI  - Cost effectiveness of the newer atypical antipsychotics: a review of the
      pharmacoeconomic research evidence.
PG  - 110-7
AB  - A comprehensive evaluation of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of
      schizophrenia involves documentation of clinical effectiveness, quality of life
      and medical cost outcomes. The results of pharmacoeconomic studies assist
      psychiatrists, and other healthcare decision-makers, in identifying
      pharmacotherapies that provide the greatest benefit to patients at the most
      acceptable cost. The cost-effectiveness of the newer atypical antipsychotics has 
      been examined using clinical decision-modeling studies and randomized clinical
      trials. The research evidence suggests that clozapine is a cost-effective
      treatment for neuroleptic refractory schizophrenia. Olanzapine and risperidone
      may be cost-neutral or, at best, slightly cost-saving compared with conventional 
      antipsychotics, although they do improve clinical symptoms and quality of life
      outcomes. There is insufficient published data on pharmacoeconomic outcomes for
      sertindole, quetiapine and ziprasidone to make any conclusions about their
      cost-effectiveness in treating schizophrenia.

TI  - [Evaluated treatment approaches in child and adolescent psychiatry II].
PG  - 206-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The principle of evidence-based medicine is to integrate data
      concerning the efficacy of interventions into clinical practice. This article
      assesses the level of evaluation of psychosocial, psychopharmacological and
      combined interventions for mental disorders in childhood and adolescence
      (schizophrenic disorders, affective disorders, phobias and anxiety disorders,
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, anorexia nervosa,
      and bulimia nervosa). METHODS: Three different levels of evaluation were defined 
      for both psychosocial and psychopharmacological interventions: A (> or = 2
      randomized controlled studies), B (1 randomized controlled study), and C (open
      studies and case studies). The level of evaluation was judged on the basis of
      original papers found in a comprehensive literature search. RESULTS: The number
      of controlled studies examining these disorders in children and adolescents is
      small, especially with regard to pharmacotherapy. However, the efficacy of
      (cognitive) behavior therapy for depressive disorders, phobias and anxiety
      disorders, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder has been demonstrated.
      CONCLUSIONS: There is still a considerable need to evaluate pharmacological
      treatment approaches for schizophrenic and affective disorders. Looking at
      psychosocial interventions in schizophrenic disorders, obsessive-compulsive
      disorder and eating disorders, specific aspects of treatment for young patients
      should be examined. Overall, the psychotherapy approach evaluated best is
      (cognitive) behavioral therapy.

TI  - Guanfacine treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.
PG  - 402-9
AB  - Norepinephrine plays a significant role in the working memory functions of the
      prefrontal cortex by its actions at alpha-2a noradrenergic receptors. Guanfacine 
      has demonstrated efficacy in reversing working memory deficits in non-human
      primate. In the present study the effect of guanfacine adjunctive treatment to
      neuroleptics on the cognitive performance of schizophrenic patients was
      investigated in a four week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel design
      trial. The primary analyses revealed no significant differences between
      guanfacine and placebo treatment; however, exploratory non-parametric statistics 
      revealed some significant and some trend differences between guanfacine and
      placebo on spatial working memory test performance and CPT reaction time in those
      subjects treated with atypical neuroleptics.

TI  - In vivo 5-HT2A receptor blockade by quetiapine: an R91150 single photon emission 
      tomography study.
PG  - 60-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical antipsychotic drugs are thought to show a high degree of
      5-HT2A receptor blockade, which may prevent the emergence of extrapyramidal
      symptoms. METHOD: 5-HT2A binding was estimated using 123I-5-I-R91150 and single
      photon emission tomography (SPET) in six schizophrenic subjects treated with
      quetiapine at a mean (+/-SD) daily dose of 350+/-123 mg for at least 5 weeks and 
      a matched sample of six healthy volunteers. Clinical and side-effect ratings were
      performed at baseline and at the time of SPET scanning. The reference region
      approach was used to define a 5-HT2A binding index in the frontal and temporal
      cortex. Results: Quetiapine treatment resulted in a significant decline in 5-HT2A
      receptor availability in the frontal cortex (mean 0.98+/-0.09) relative to
      healthy volunteers (mean 1.33+/-0.16). All patients showed improvements in
      clinical symptom or side-effect ratings. The mean frontal cortex:cerebellum ratio
      after quetiapine treatment was significantly negatively correlated with reduction
      in the Abnormal Involuntary Rating scale and Simpson-Angus scores (P<0.05
      Bonferroni corrected), but not with the reduction in the scores from the scale
      for the assessment of positive symptoms, the scale for the assessment of negative
      symptoms, the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale or patient age.
      CONCLUSION: Quetiapine treatment results in significant in vivo blockade of
      cortical 5-HT2A, similar to other atypical antipsychotic drugs. This effect may
      contribute to its placebo level extrapyramidal side-effect profile.

TI  - Adherence assessments and the use of depot antipsychotics in patients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic medications significantly ameliorate the symptoms of
      schizophrenia, but patients are often noncompliant with these medications.
      Research evidence supports the use of depot antipsychotics in noncompliant
      patients. METHOD: Between January 9, 1991, and December 19, 1995, 1307 veterans
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (ICD-9) were enrolled in a study
      of enhanced psychosocial programming at 14 Veterans Administration Medical
      Centers. All had a history of high inpatient use. At enrollment, clinicians
      listed patient medications, rated patient compliance, and completed a Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).
      Patients reported medication side effects. We describe depot antipsychotic use
      among these patients and examine the relationship between depot use, assessed
      compliance, and patient characteristics. RESULTS: At enrollment, 18% of patients 
      in this cohort were receiving depot antipsychotics; however, clinicians reported 
      that 49% had been noncompliant with medication in the past year. Depot use varied
      significantly with treatment site; African Americans were more likely to receive 
      depot antipsychotics and less likely to receive atypical antipsychotics than
      white patients. Patients on depot and oral agents had similar levels of
      psychiatric symptoms, but patients on depot antipsychotics were more likely to
      receive high doses and complain of side effects. CONCLUSION: Clinicians
      prescribed depot antipsychotics relatively infrequently, despite high rates of
      noncompliance and high levels of inpatient use. Variation in use with treatment
      site and ethnic group suggests barriers to implementing research-based
      recommendations for depot use in noncompliant patients. Quality improvement
      programs should consider facilitating the appropriate use of depots.

TI  - Olanzapine therapy in treatment-resistant psychotic mood disorders: a long-term
      follow-up study.
PG  - 509-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest a role for the atypical antipsychotic
      olanzapine in the acute treatment of psychotic mood disorders, but long-term data
      are unavailable. The purpose of this naturalistic study was to determine the
      long-term effectiveness and tolerability of olanzapine as add-on therapy in
      psychotic mood disorders. METHOD: Hospital records were reviewed for 125
      inpatients at the state psychiatric hospital in Buffalo, N.Y., who received at
      least 6 weeks of add-on olanzapine treatment for psychotic mood disorders
      (schizoaffective disorders [bipolar and depressive type], bipolar disorders [I,
      II, and NOS], and major depressive disorder). A group of schizophrenic patients
      served as a control group (N = 50). Baseline measures, including age, gender,
      number of hospitalizations in the 2 years prior to olanzapine treatment,
      concomitant medications, the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), and the
      Global Assessment of Functioning-Equivalent (GAF-EQ) and Kennedy Axis V
      psychological impairment, violence, social skills, and activities of daily living
      subscale scores, were obtained. Follow-up information was obtained from the
      patients at least 6 months after initiation of olanzapine or by chart review and 
      discussion with the treating psychiatrist. Patients with a diagnosis of psychotic
      mood disorders were compared with patients with the non-affective psychotic
      disorder (schizophrenia) on a variety of outcome measures. RESULTS: Follow-up
      information was available on 102 patients (82%). Mean follow-up was 15 months; 50
      (49%) of the 102 patients remained on olanzapine treatment at follow-up (32
      psychotic mood disorder, 18 schizophrenic). The primary reason for
      discontinuation in both groups was lack of response. Both the psychotic mood
      disorder and schizophrenic groups had comparable outcomes on the CGI and GAF-EQ. 
      Improvement on the Kennedy Axis V psychological impairment and social skills
      subscales was seen only in the psychotic mood disorders group (p < .01); both
      groups showed significant (p < .02) improvement in the violence subscale.
      Sustained mood-stabilizing effect was evident in only 7/27 (26%) of the psychotic
      mood disorders patients continuing on add-on olanzapine treatment at follow-up.
      CONCLUSION: Lack of response was the primary reason for discontinuation of add-on
      olanzapine in both groups. Mood symptoms predicted a better response to add-on
      olanzapine in patients with psychotic mood disorders on selective outcome
      measures. However, only 26% of the patients with psychotic mood disorders
      sustained a clinically meaningful mood-stabilizing effect with add-on olanzapine 
      treatment at follow-up.

TI  - Psychosis treatment prior to psychosis onset: ethical issues.
PG  - 47-54
AB  - Clinical trials have begun of antipsychotic treatments in persons who are
      prodromally symptomatic and at high risk for schizophrenia but who have not yet
      become psychotic. The ethical issues connected with intervening prior to making a
      diagnosis of psychosis are detailed. Compelling but tentative evidence suggests
      that early treatment may improve course and prognosis, and this has initiated a
      paradigm shift in thinking about the risks and benefits of early intervention.
      The nature of this evidence, its implications, its shortcomings, and its effect
      upon the ethics of treating schizophrenia are elaborated and discussed. It is
      concluded that clinical psychiatry is currently in a state of "equipoise" or
      genuine uncertainty about the comparative merits of early treatment, a state
      which endorses early intervention research, including intervention in the
      prodromal phase.

TI  - Olanzapine for schizophrenia refractory to typical and atypical antipsychotics:
      an open-label, prospective trial.
PG  - 448-53
AB  - The role of olanzapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia is still unresolved. 
      This article presents an open-label, prospective, 14-week trial with olanzapine
      in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder selected for
      unambiguous resistance to either clozapine or risperidone and to typical
      antipsychotics. Forty-three inpatients (mean age, 41.6 years; mean duration of
      illness, 21.7 years) were enrolled and treated after cross-titration from their
      previous antipsychotic treatment with olanzapine 10 to 40 mg daily without any
      concomitant antipsychotic medication. Patients were evaluated with the Positive
      and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions Scale, and
      the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. The change with olanzapine treatment was
      associated with a PANSS total score improvement of 3.7 (SD = 15.6; not
      significant). There was a significant improvement for the PANSS cognitive and
      depression/anxiety factors, whereas the PANSS excitement factor worsened. The
      improvement rate was superior in patients receiving olanzapine doses higher than 
      20 mg. A total of 16.7% of patients reached response criteria set forth by a
      previous study. There was a significant decrease in extrapyramidal side effects
      (t = 2.04; p < 0.05) and statistically significant, yet modest, weight gain.
      These results indicate that olanzapine is only modestly effective in these
      severely treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia. However, a trial with
      olanzapine can be recommended in these patients before moving to augmentation
      strategies, given the lack of proven alternatives and the observation that 16.7% 
      of patients reached the response criteria.

TI  - An evaluation of risperidone drug interactions.
PG  - 408-16
AB  - Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug, is widely used in the treatment of
      psychoses associated with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and other
      psychiatric disorders. Polypharmacology is a necessary condition for the optimal 
      treatment of many patients with comorbid psychiatric and medical illness. One
      concern raised by the widespread use of multiple concurrent pharmacotherapies is 
      the potential for drug-drug interactions to adversely affect patient outcome.
      Accordingly, the biomedical literature was reviewed for reports of drug
      interactions involving risperidone, and the clinical significance of each report 
      was evaluated. Additionally, the potential for risperidone to participate in drug
      interactions was evaluated by considering the drug's pharmacokinetic properties. 
      Controlled studies and case reports indicate that risperidone has a low potential
      for metabolic drug interactions. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 or 
      induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter risperidone plasma concentrations, but the
      clinical significance of such interactions seems to be minimal. Adherence to a
      few guidelines for the design of dosage regimens should limit the effect of
      drug-drug interactions on patient status and contribute to optimal
      pharmacotherapy with risperidone.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized comparison of the efficacy and safety of intramuscular
      injections of olanzapine, lorazepam, or placebo in treating acutely agitated
      patients diagnosed with bipolar mania.
PG  - 389-97
AB  - There are no rapid-acting intramuscular formulations of atypical antipsychotics
      available for quickly calming an agitated patient with bipolar disorder. In this 
      study, 201 agitated patients with bipolar mania were randomly assigned to receive
      one to three injections of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (10 mg, first
      two injections; 5 mg, third injection), the benzodiazepine lorazepam (2 mg, first
      two injections; 1 mg, third injection), or placebo (placebo, first two
      injections; olanzapine, 10 mg, third injection) within a 24-hour period.
      Agitation was measured at baseline, every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours, and
      at 24 hours after the first injection using the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale-Excited Component subscale and two additional agitation scales. At 2 hours 
      after the first injection, patients treated with olanzapine showed a
      significantly greater reduction in scores on all agitation scales compared with
      patients treated with either placebo or lorazepam. At 24 hours after the first
      injection, olanzapine remained statistically superior to placebo in reducing
      agitation in patients with acute mania, whereas patients treated with lorazepam
      were not significantly different from those treated with placebo or olanzapine.
      Furthermore, no significant differences among the three treatment groups were
      observed in safety measures, including treatment-emergent extrapyramidal
      symptoms, the incidence of acute dystonia, or QTc interval changes. These
      findings suggest that intramuscular olanzapine is a safe and effective treatment 
      for reducing acute agitation in patients with bipolar mania.

TI  - Non-linear dynamic analysis of clozapine-induced electroencephalographic changes 
      in schizophrenic patients--a preliminary study.
PG  - 1229-39
AB  - 1. In order to find the electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters that reflect the
      effect of clozapine in schizophrenic patients, the authors applied various
      non-linear analyses on multi-channel EEG data drawn from patients before and
      after a therapeutic trial of clozapine. 2. The correlation dimension was
      difficult to extract from our limited time series EEG data and the authors did
      not find a meaningful association with clozapine use. The primary Lyapunov
      exponent could be reliably calculated but also did not reflect the effect of
      clozapine. 3. However, the mutual cross-prediction (MCP) algorithm showed
      potentially meaningful results. The driving system was shifted to the frontal
      channels after a 4-week trial with clozapine. Moreover, MCP might have a value as
      a predictor of treatment response. 4. Although preliminary in nature, the MCP
      might have greater power for interpreting complex changes from channel to channel
      in EEG induced by clozapine.

AB  - Perospirone is an atypical antipsychotic agent for the treatment of
      schizophrenia. Its primary mode of action is through antagonism of serotonin
      5-HT2A and dopamine D2 receptors. An 8-week course of oral perospirone 8 to 48
      mg/day displayed efficacy in up to 75% of patients with schizophrenia
      participating in phase II and phase III trials. The onset of action of the drug
      was about 2 weeks. Perospirone was effective against positive, negative and
      general symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, as assessed with standard rating
      scales (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale).
      Compared with haloperidol 2 to 12 mg/day, perospirone 8 to 48 mg/day was
      significantly more effective against negative symptoms and tended to be more
      effective against general symptoms and most positive symptoms in a trial in 145
      patients with schizophrenia. Perospirone had efficacy similar to that of
      mosapramine 50 to 300 mg/day in a comparative phase III trial in 159 patients.
      Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) tended to occur less often and were generally
      milder with perospirone than with haloperidol or mosapramine.

TI  - Olanzapine in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder: a pilot study.
PG  - 197-203
AB  - Because the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine may be efficacious in treating
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, we conducted a 10-week,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation in which 15 patients were randomized 
      2:1 to either olanzapine or placebo. The initial dosage was 5 mg/day and was
      titrated to a maximum of 20 mg/day. Eleven patients completed the study. Patients
      in both groups showed improvement in PTSD symptoms, but no between-group
      differences in treatment response were observed and a high placebo response rate 
      was found. Both treatments were tolerated well, although the olanzapine treatment
      group had more weight gain. Olanzapine fared no better than placebo in this
      preliminary study in the treatment of PTSD. The lack of difference between
      olanzapine and placebo may in part be due to olanzapine's not being effective in 
      PTSD or, alternatively, a small sample size, a high placebo response in certain
      forms of PTSD and the chronicity of PTSD symptoms in some patients.

TI  - Risperidone olanzapine drug outcomes studies in schizophrenia (RODOS): efficacy
      and tolerability results of an international naturalistic study.
PG  - 179-87
AB  - The Risperidone Olanzapine Drug Outcomes studies in Schizophrenia (RODOS)
      programme was an international series of naturalistic studies designed to
      evaluate drug use patterns and outcomes. RODOS consisted of retrospective chart
      reviews performed in patients who had been admitted to hospital and treated in 61
      centres in nine countries. The analysed population consisted of 1901 patients
      with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The mean (SD) daily 
      doses of risperidone and olanzapine were 5.3 (2.6) mg/day and 14.5 (5.1) mg/day, 
      respectively. Patients treated with risperidone stayed an average of 3.8 days
      less in hospital compared to those receiving olanzapine (time to discharge was
      43.6 days versus 47.4 days, respectively; P = 0.004). Risperidone was rated as
      effective in significantly more patients than olanzapine (84% versus 79%; P =
      0.01). The time to onset of efficacy was significantly shorter with risperidone
      than with olanzapine (P < 0.001). The numbers of adverse events in the two
      treatment groups were not significantly different (13% risperidone, 11%
      olanzapine; P = 0.1). Correcting for small but statistically significant baseline
      differences between the two treatment groups did not produce a substantive change
      in the magnitude or significance of any outcome parameter. In conclusion, the
      clinical outcomes reported by RODOS suggest that risperidone may be more
      effective as a first-line therapy drug for schizophrenia than olanzapine.

TI  - Comparative study of mortality rates and cardiac dysrhythmias in post-marketing
      surveillance studies of sertindole and two other atypical antipsychotic drugs,
      risperidone and olanzapine.
PG  - 120-6
AB  - Sertindole (Serdolect), an atypical antipsychotic, was voluntarily suspended in
      the European Union in 1998 following regulatory concerns over reports of serious 
      cardiac dysrhythmias and sudden unexpected deaths. The reported causes of death, 
      their frequency, prolongation of the rate corrected QT interval (QTc) and cardiac
      dysrhythmias in patients prescribed sertindole were compared with those for
      patients treated with two other atypical antipsychotics. All patients in England,
      prescribed atypical antipsychotics by general practitioners during each drug's
      immediate post-marketing period, were identified using an observational cohort
      technique, prescription-event monitoring. Mortality rates in the sertindole
      cohort were compared with those in a comparator cohort using standardized
      mortality ratios and incidence rate ratios. Cardiovascular events were reviewed
      and followed up to identify cases of prolongation of QTc interval. There was no
      statistically significant difference in mortality rates between sertindole and
      the comparator cohort, although confidence intervals (CI) were wide due to small 
      numbers in the sertindole cohort. A much smaller number of patients were
      prescribed sertindole than the other antipsychotics. Six cases of prolongation of
      QTc interval were identified in 462 patients (1.3%, 95% CI 0.5-2.8) treated with 
      sertindole and one with unspecified electrocardiogram changes in the comparator
      cohort of 16,542 patients. This study contributes to the understanding of the
      occurrence of prolongation of QTc interval during clinical use of sertindole, the
      incidence of which was similar to that in clinical trials. Although no
      statistically significant difference was shown in mortality rates between
      sertindole and comparator cohort, the sertindole cohort was too small to rule out
      an association between the use of this drug and cardiovascular deaths.

TI  - Effects of long-term treatment with antipsychotics on serum leptin levels.
PG  - 59-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal regulation of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin could
      play a role in body weight gain induced by antipsychotics. AIMS: To study the
      effects of long-term antipsychotic treatment on leptin levels in patients with
      schizophrenia. METHOD: Serum leptin levels were determined in 59 out-patients
      with chronic schizophrenia and in the same number of healthy subjects controlled 
      by gender, age and body mass index. RESULTS: Leptin levels did not differ between
      patients and controls. Leptin levels in patients with schizophrenia correlated
      with weight gain, even after controlling for current weight, but did not show any
      association with clinical variables. Antipsychotic class tended to exert
      different effects over leptin levels (among atypicals, olanzapine induced a
      greater increase). CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of leptin levels induced by chronic
      antipsychotic treatment can be attributed to weight gain, but other mechanisms
      could be involved.

TI  - Dropout rates in randomised antipsychotic drug trials.
PG  - 230-3
AB  - RATIONALE: It has been assumed that new atypical drugs improve treatment
      compliance due to fewer adverse effects. Data supporting this assumption are
      scarce. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to study attrition rates in
      randomised controlled trials of oral administration of conventional antipsychotic
      drugs, atypical antipsychotic drugs and placebo. METHODS: The database of the
      Schizophrenia Module of the Cochrane Library was utilised for the present study. 
      The data in the Cochrane Module are collected by identifying relevant randomised 
      controlled trials from several electronic databases and other sources. Number of 
      dropouts was defined as patients leaving the study preterm due to any reason.
      RESULTS: Data from 328 treatment groups, consisting of 18,585 randomised subjects
      from 163 drug trials, were entered in the analysis. One-third of the subjects had
      dropped out of the trials. The dropout rates significantly increased for each
      calendar year. Year of trial publication, type of drug and trial length remained 
      statistically significant contributors to dropout rates. In a model incorporating
      year of publication and trial length, placebo groups and groups treated with
      conventional antipsychotics had significantly higher attrition rates than groups 
      treated with atypical drugs. When clozapine-treated groups were excluded from the
      analysis, no statistically significant advantage for atypical drugs over
      conventional drugs remained. CONCLUSIONS: Trial data implicate that a better
      compliance can be achieved by favouring atypical drugs rather than conventional
      alternatives in the treatment of schizophrenia. However, this effect is found
      only when groups treated with the atypical antipsychotic clozapine are included
      in the analysis. Our study did not find evidence for a statistically significant 
      superiority in acceptability of novel atypical drugs when compared to
      conventional antipsychotics.

TI  - Long-term care in dementia: patients and caregivers.
PG  - 52-62
AB  - General principles of managing chronic, age-associated diseases apply as much to 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other late-life dementing disorders as they do to
      congestive heart failure or osteoarthritis. Beyond efforts to maintain residual
      tissue or organ function, important physician roles include promoting general
      well-being and helping patients and their caregivers adjust to disease-related
      limitations. Physicians provide essential information to patients and their
      families about the disease, its social and legal ramifications, and community
      resources to facilitate care. Therefore, physicians must be knowledgeable about
      broadly intersecting medical, legal, financial, and ethical issues surrounding
      the long-term management of AD and other dementias. The many challenges faced by 
      patients with dementia and their caregivers over time underscore the need for an 
      ongoing diagnostic and therapeutic alliance with primary care physicians. This
      article reviews salient aspects of long-term care for patients with AD and other 
      dementias, highlighting the vital and varied roles of physicians in managing
      these chronic brain disorders.

AB  - A growing consensus indicates that Alzheimer's disease (AD) results from an
      increase in the production or accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (A beta)
      leading to nerve cell death. Mechanisms by which A beta accumulation leads to
      neuronal death include oxidative damage and inflammation. This article discusses 
      the management of AD patients with antioxidants, cholinesterase inhibitors, and
      psychotropic agents. Studies show that these agents can slow the progression of
      the disease, improve cognition, and reduce behavioral disturbances. A therapeutic
      alliance between physician and caregiver is an essential element in successfully 
      managing the AD patient. The 3Rs--repeat, reassure, and redirect--can help
      caregivers reduce behavioral disturbances in patients with AD and limit the need 
      for pharmacologic management.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of intramuscular olanzapine and
      intramuscular haloperidol in the treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenia.
PG  - 1149-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the comparative efficacy and safety of
      intramuscular olanzapine, intramuscular haloperidol, and intramuscular placebo
      for the treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenia. METHOD: Hospitalized
      patients with schizophrenia received one to three injections of intramuscular
      olanzapine, 10 mg, intramuscular haloperidol, 7.5 mg, or intramuscular placebo
      over a 24-hour period. Agitation was measured with the excited component of the
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and two additional scales. RESULTS:
      According to scores on the excited component of the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale, both intramuscular olanzapine and intramuscular haloperidol
      reduced agitation significantly more than intramuscular placebo 2 and 24 hours
      following the first injection. Intramuscular olanzapine reduced agitation
      significantly more than intramuscular haloperidol 15, 30, and 45 minutes
      following the first injection. No patients treated with intramuscular olanzapine 
      experienced acute dystonia, compared with 7% of those who were treated with
      intramuscular haloperidol. No significant QT(c) interval changes were observed in
      any patients. CONCLUSIONS: Intramuscular olanzapine represents a rapid,
      effective, and safe treatment for acute agitation in schizophrenia.

TI  - A meta-analysis of the use of typical antipsychotic agents in bipolar disorder.
PG  - 85-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential benefits of typical antipsychotic agents in bipolar
      disorder are offset by serious treatment-associated side effects. Despite these
      concerns and the availability of mood stabilizing agents, the treatment of
      bipolar disorder with typical antipsychotic agents appears to be widespread.
      METHODS: A Medline search identified 16 publications that outlined medication use
      among 2378 bipolar disorder patients. Meta-analysis was used to estimate a
      weighted average of the relative proportions of the treatment use, where the
      weights were the reciprocals of the estimated variances for each study. RESULTS: 
      Overall, 84.7% of bipolar patients received typical antipsychotic agents, with a 
      loading toward a greater in-patient (90.7%) relative to out-patient (65.3%) use. 
      Monotherapy accounted for 53.8% of typical antipsychotic use, and typical
      antipsychotic/mood stabilizer combination therapy accounted for 47.4%. In four
      studies where length of treatment data were available, the median of minimum
      typical antipsychotic use was 2.5 months, with 96.0% of the patients receiving
      typical antipsychotic agents. LIMITATIONS: The meta-analytic technique employed
      in this analysis is limited by the possible inclusion of studies with unreliable 
      study designs or biased treatment practices, publication bias in which some
      studies may not have been reported, and possible lack of identification of all
      relevant studies. CONCLUSIONS: Typical antipsychotic agents are commonly used in 
      the treatment of bipolar disorder, possibly due to dissatisfaction with mood
      stabilizer monotherapy especially in psychotic mania, the high prevalence of
      psychotic symptoms in acute mania, inappropriate continuation of typical
      antipsychotic agents after initial stabilization, and/or unavailability or
      unfamiliarity with new treatments. These findings also suggest that typical
      antipsychotics may have not only antipsychotic effects in mania but perhaps also 
      antimanic properties.

TI  - Neurotoxicity as a mechanism for neurodegenerative disorders: basic and clinical 
      aspects.
PG  - 985-9
AB  - This three day meeting focused on chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as
      Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amylotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS). It attracted 69 participants from 10 countries with dominance of
      Chile and USA. Neurodegeneration and its prevention increasingly gain in
      importance as the number of people affected increases year-by-year. The meeting
      addressed various basic aspects having pragmatic implications such as: oxidative 
      stress, inflammatory reaction, glial activation, role of glutamatergic system and
      apoptosis using a plethora of in vitro and in vivo methods.

TI  - Acute necrotizing encephalopathy presenting as a basal ganglia syndrome.
PG  - 461-2
AB  - Acute necrotizing encephalopathy is a relatively new disease. The characteristic 
      clinical findings are of febrile illness followed by rapid deterioration in
      mental status and seizures. The hallmark of the disease is multifocal bilateral
      symmetric lesions affecting the thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem tegmentum,
      cerebral white matter, and cerebellum. The etiology is unknown, but
      immune-mediated mechanism was suggested. We present a 12-year-old previously
      healthy girl who developed increased sleepiness progressing to stupor and coma.
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed the characteristic findings 
      previously described in acute necrotizing encephalopathy. Her mental status
      improved dramatically with steroid treatment, and the MRI findings resolved
      completely within 6 months. Following the acute illness, she developed a complex 
      neuropsychiatric disorder consistent with basal ganglia syndrome.

TI  - Risperidone monotherapy in preschool children with pervasive developmental
      disorders.
PG  - 395-400
AB  - The aim of this preliminary study was to examine the short-term efficacy and
      safety of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone in preschool autistic children. 
      The sample consisted of 10 subjects (7 males and 3 females) aged 3 9/12 to 6 6/12
      years (mean age 4.7 years). A 16-week open-label trial with risperidone
      monotherapy was initiated at a starting dose of 0.25 mg daily and was increased
      to a maximum dose of 0.50 mg (0.027 mg/kg daily). Outcome measures were the
      Childhood Autism Rating Scale, the Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical 
      Global Impression (improvement score), and the Children's Global Assessment of
      Functioning. Two subjects did not complete the trial because of side effects
      (tachycardia and flushes, fever and hyporexia). After the 16-week treatment, data
      from the eight children who completed the trial indicated a modest improvement in
      the Childhood Autism Rating Scale total score, Children's Psychiatric Rating
      Scale total score, and Children's Global Assessment of Functioning. According to 
      the Clinical Global Impression, the global improvement score for four subjects
      was much improved or very much improved; the score for the other four children
      was minimally improved. None of the children exhibited behavioral deterioration. 
      The side effects in the eight children were not severe.

PG  - 404-13
AB  - In this article, we present a method for estimating and comparing the
      treatment-specific distributions of a discrete time-to-event variable from
      right-censored data. Our method allows for (1) adjustment for informative
      censoring due to measured prognostic factors for time to event and censoring and 
      (2) quantification of the sensitivity of the inference to residual dependence
      between time to event and censoring due to unmeasured factors. We develop our
      approach in the context of a randomized trial for the treatment of chronic
      schizophrenia. We perform a simulation study to assess the practical performance 
      of our methodology.

TI  - The apparent effects of ziprasidone on plasma lipids and glucose.
PG  - 347-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the effects of ziprasidone on body mass index (BMI) and
      serum levels of glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. METHOD: As part of a
      multicenter study examining different strategies for switching to ziprasidone
      from other antipsychotics, we evaluated weight and serum glucose, cholesterol,
      and triglyceride measurements at baseline and following 6 weeks on ziprasidone
      treatment in 37 patients at our site. RESULTS: Short-term treatment with
      ziprasidone appeared to lead to significant reduction in serum cholesterol (p <
      .001) and triglyceride levels (p = .018) independent of changes in BMI.
      Ziprasidone treatment appeared to have no significant effect on BMI or glucose
      level, perhaps due to the small number of subjects. CONCLUSION: Ziprasidone
      appears to independently lead to a lowering of serum lipid levels.

TI  - Treatment of suicidality in schizophrenia.
PG  - 44-58; discussion 58-60
AB  - Between 4 and 13% of people with schizophrenia commit suicide and between 25 and 
      50% make a suicide attempt, a reflection of the devastating toll this syndrome
      takes on the quality of life, that is, the subjective and objective sense of
      well-being. Many risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia have been identified, 
      the most important of which are previous suicide attempts, depression,
      hopelessness, substance abuse, and male gender. Insight into having a serious
      mental illness and less severe cognitive impairment are also associated with
      increased risk for suicide in schizophrenia, most likely when accompanied by
      feelings of hopelessness. Typical neuroleptic drugs have not been shown to reduce
      the risk of suicide. However, several types of evidence suggest that clozapine,
      an atypical antipsychotic drug, appreciably reduces the suicide attempt and
      completion rates in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, perhaps by as
      much as 75-85%. Other atypical antipsychotic drugs may have a similar effect, but
      direct evidence is lacking. Improvement in positive and negative symptoms,
      reduced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), a direct antidepressant action,
      improved cognitive function, and improved compliance may contribute to reduced
      suicidality. The International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT) is a large
      prospective, randomized study intended to compare the effectiveness of clozapine 
      with that of olanzapine in reducing suicide and suicide-related events in
      schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. Some information about suicidality in
      the patient sample is reported here.

TI  - Effects of olanzapine and haloperidol on serum prolactin levels in male
      schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 641-7
AB  - It has been proposed that new atypical antipsychotics cause minimal prolactin
      (PRL) elevation compared to traditional antipsychotic agents because they spare
      dopamine blockade within the brain's tuberoinfundibular tract. The aim of this
      study was to compare the effects of olanzapine and haloperidol on PRL secretion
      in male schizophrenic patients. Twenty-nine male schizophrenic inpatients were
      included in the study. Fifteen of them were given olanzapine in a fixed dose of
      10 mg/day PO and 14 of them were given haloperidol in a fixed dose of 10 mg/day
      PO for 6 weeks after a 2-week drug washout period. Fifteen age-matched healthy
      control subjects were used as control group. PRL levels were measured both before
      and after the 6-week treatment period in the patients. At the end of the 6th
      week, the PRL values observed with olanzapine treatment were significantly less
      than those observed with haloperidol, but not different from those of the
      controls. There was a significant positive correlation between the PRL values and
      the severity of extrapyramidal side effects in only the haloperidol group after
      the six week's treatment period. Our data indicate that short-term olanzapine
      treatment at doses of 10 mg/day PO causes minimal elevations in PRL secretion in 
      male schizophrenic patients in contrast to haloperidol. This finding is
      consistent with the previous reports and may be attributed to olanzapine's
      differential effects on dopamine neurotransmission.

TI  - Consensus on the Practical Use of Amisulpride, an Atypical Antipsychotic, in the 
      Treatment of Schizophrenia.
PG  - 41-6
AB  - Clinical expectations in schizophrenia treatment have greatly increased since the
      introduction of new atypical antipsychotics, but the choice of therapeutic
      strategy has become more complex and reference guidelines are scarce. This paper 
      summarizes the consensus of a broad range of professionals after long-term
      commercialization in France of an atypical antipsychotic, amisulpride.
      Participants were from psychiatric hospitals, private clinics, out-patients
      settings and research; all were experienced with the drug. Discussions focused on
      the practical use of amisulpride, as, in addition to the double-blind trials
      information, it may be useful for psychiatrists of other countries to intuitively
      understand the therapeutic properties of amisulpride. The topics selected include
      acute psychotic episodes, short- and long-term follow-up, feasibility of treating
      the initial phase, the elderly and switching treatments. The French experience
      emphasizes the central role of amisulpride as a first-line treatment of
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Intramuscular (IM) ziprasidone 20 mg is effective in reducing acute agitation
      associated with psychosis: a double-blind, randomized trial.
PG  - 128-34
AB  - RATIONALE: Intramuscular (IM) conventional antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines 
      are effective in the short-term treatment of acutely agitated psychotic patients 
      but may be associated with adverse effects. A short-acting IM formulation of the 
      novel antipsychotic, ziprasidone, which may offer advantages over conventional
      agents, has been developed. OBJECTIVE: To compare ziprasidone IM 2 mg (n=38) and 
      20 mg (n=41) in the acute control and short-term management of agitated psychotic
      patients. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, 24-h study assessed
      efficacy using the Behavioral Activity Rating Scale (BARS) and the PANSS. The
      BARS is a validated rating scale for the assessment of treatment response in
      acute agitation associated with psychosis. Following the initial dose, three more
      doses could be given 4 h apart if needed during the 24-h period. RESULTS: The
      mean BARS score had decreased 15 min after the first 20 mg IM dose and was
      statistically significantly lower than the 2 mg group at 30 min post-dose. The
      improvement with the 20 mg dose increased until 2 h, and was maintained until at 
      least 4 h post-dose (P<0.001). Two hours after the first injection, almost all of
      the patients receiving ziprasidone 20 mg were BARS responders compared with just 
      one-third of those receiving 2 mg ziprasidone (P<0.001). The calming effect of
      ziprasidone was also evident by the significant reduction in PANSS agitation
      items (P<0.05) and CGI-severity at 4 h (P=0.008). Both ziprasidone doses were
      very well tolerated. Ziprasidone IM 20 mg was not associated with EPS, dystonia, 
      akathisia, respiratory depression or with excessive sedation. CONCLUSIONS:
      Ziprasidone IM 20 mg substantially and significantly reduced the symptoms of
      acute agitation in patients with psychotic disorders. Ziprasidone 20 mg IM was
      very well tolerated and produced no dystonia or akathisia.

TI  - Rapid capillary electrophoretic method for the determination of clozapine and

PG  - 289-96
AB  - A rapid and sensitive high-performance capillary electrophoretic method for the
      determination of clozapine and its main metabolite desmethylclozapine in human
      plasma was developed. The separation of the two analytes was carried out in an
      untreated fused-silica capillary [33 cm (8.5 cm effective length) x 50 microm
      I.D.] filled with a background electrolyte at pH 2.5 containing
      beta-cyclodextrin. Baseline separation of clozapine and desmethylclozapine was
      recorded in less than 3 min. An accurate sample pretreatment by means of
      solid-phase extraction and subsequent concentration allows for reliable
      quantitation of clozapine in the plasma of schizophrenic patients under treatment
      with the drug. The method showed good precision (mean RSD = 4.0%) as well as
      satisfactory extraction yields (approximately 88%) and a good sensitivity (limit 
      of quantitation = 0.075 microg ml(-1), limit of detection = 0.025 microg ml(-1)).

TI  - Optimal dosing with risperidone: updated recommendations.
PG  - 282-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug dosages utilized during controlled clinical trials are not
      always optimal for patients encountered in day-to-day practice. The original
      trials of risperidone, a novel antipsychotic, suggested that an initial target
      dose of 6 mg/day was appropriate, but these trials were necessarily conducted
      among patients who were chronically impaired, hospitalized, and often partly drug
      resistant. DATA SOURCES: Relevant data relating to the dosage of risperidone
      identified through an online (MEDLINE) search using the keywords risperidone,
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder dementia, bipolar disorder, and dose were
      supplemented by a review of international and U.S. Congress abstracts in which
      the dose of risperidone was specifically described. CONCLUSION: On the basis of
      naturalistic studies, clinical audit, phase 4 trials, positron emission
      tomography data, and 5 years of clinical experience, the currently recommended
      target dose of risperidone is 4 mg/day for most patients, with less-rapid
      titration than previously recommended. Moreover, a lower dose than this and
      slower titration may be appropriate for elderly patients, young patients, and
      first-episode patients.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of risperidone in the treatment of aggression in
      hospitalized adolescents with subaverage cognitive abilities.
PG  - 239-48
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that blocks dopamine as
      well as serotonin receptor systems. The present study was designed to examine the
      efficacy and safety of risperidone in a 6-week double-blind, randomized,
      parallel-group design in the treatment of aggression in adolescents with a
      primary diagnosis of DSM-IV disruptive behavior disorders and with subaverage
      intelligence. METHOD: We randomly assigned 38 adolescents (33 boys; 10 subjects
      with slightly subaverage IQ, 14 with borderline IQ, and 14 with mild mental
      retardation), who were hospitalized for treatment of psychiatric disorders
      associated with severe aggression, to receive risperidone or placebo. The main
      efficacy measures were the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale 
      (CGI-S), the modified Overt Aggression Scale (OAS-M), and the Aberrant Behavior
      Checklist (ABC). Side effects were measured using the Extrapyramidal Symptom
      Rating Scale (ESRS). RESULTS: The mean daily dose of risperidone at the end of
      treatment was 2.9 mg (range, 1.5-4 mg). Risperidone, compared with placebo, was
      associated with significant improvements on the CGI-S (p < .001) and the
      at-school ABC overall and hyperactivity scales (p < .05). During a 2-week washout
      following the 6-week trial, a statistically significant worsening was found in
      the risperidone group on the CGI-S scale, the OAS-M. and the ABC. Extrapyramidal 
      symptoms were absent or very mild during risperidone treatment. Transient
      tiredness was present in 11 (58%) of 19 drug-treated subjects. Other untoward
      effects included sialorrhea, nausea, and slight weight gain (mean = 3.5% of body 
      weight in the risperidone group). No clinically relevant changes were found in
      laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram, heart rate, or blood pressure.
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that risperidone may be effective for severe
      aggression in adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders and subaverage
      intelligence, and these results are consistent with reports suggesting its
      effectiveness for treating severe aggression in adolescents in general.

TI  - Factors influencing acute weight change in patients with schizophrenia treated
      with olanzapine, haloperidol, or risperidone.
PG  - 231-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical factors predicting weight change in patients with
      schizophrenia and related disorders during acute treatment with the antipsychotic
      drugs olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol were sought through retrospective 
      analyses. METHOD: Six-week body-weight data from 2 trials, study 1 comparing
      olanzapine and haloperidol (N = 1,369) and study 2 olanzapine and risperidone (N 
      = 268), were analyzed. Effects of 8 clinically relevant covariates--therapy,
      clinical outcome (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), baseline body mass index
      (BBMI), increased appetite, age, gender, race, and dose--on weight were compared.
      RESULTS: In study 1, olanzapine (vs. haloperidol) therapy, better clinical
      outcome, lower BBMI, and nonwhite race significantly affected weight gain.
      Effects of increased appetite and male gender on weight gain were significant for
      olanzapine but not for haloperidol. In study 2, better clinical outcome, lower
      BBMI, and younger age significantly affected weight gain. Increased appetite was 
      more frequent during olanzapine treatment than during haloperidol, but not
      significantly different from risperidone. Significant differences in effect on
      weight change were found between olanzapine and haloperidol but not between
      olanzapine and risperidone. No evidence was found that lower antipsychotic drug
      doses were associated with lower weight gain. CONCLUSION: This report identifies 
      predictive factors of acute weight change in patients with schizophrenia. Similar
      factors across antipsychotic drugs in predicting greater weight gain included
      better clinical outcome, low BBMI, and nonwhite race. Factors differing between
      conventional (haloperidol) and atypical (olanzapine) agents included increased
      appetite and gender. Choice of atypical antipsychotic drug (olanzapine vs.
      risperidone) was of minor importance with regard to influence on acute weight
      gain.

AB  - Many children of a schizophrenic parent may inherit a portion of the genetic risk
      factors for schizophrenia. The frequency of DSM-IV psychopathology in children of
      a schizophrenic parent and the frequency and type of mental health treatment
      accessed by these youths is not well understood. Twenty-eight adults with
      schizophrenia were identified and 43 of their 6--15 year old children recruited. 
      Clinical diagnoses, based on a structured DSM-IV interview; severity of
      impairment, based on the Child Global Assessment Scale; and treatment histories
      were obtained. Seventy-four per cent of children-with-a-schizophrenic-parent met 
      diagnostic criteria for a current Axis I psychiatric disorder. The most common
      diagnostic categories included attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (40%),
      any anxiety disorder (23%), and any depressive disorder (12%). Psychosis was
      present in 9% of this childhood sample. Of those children with a psychiatric
      diagnosis, 47% demonstrated current moderate or severe impairment. Approximately 
      half of the children had received mental health evaluations and 26% had
      experienced at least one psychiatric medication trial.
      Children-with-a-schizophrenic-parent have frequent, often impairing, psychiatric 
      problems. Despite this high prevalence, mental health evaluation and treatment is
      of similar frequency and type to other at-risk populations. The effectiveness and
      appropriateness of standard treatments remain unstudied in
      children-with-a-schizophrenic-parent.

      double blind randomized trial: a post hoc analysis.
PG  - 89-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients who remain in hospital for an extended time pose a special
      therapeutic challenge. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to examine whether 
      the acute response of long-term hospitalized schizophrenic patients differs
      between haloperidol and risperidone based on a post hoc, sub-analysis of data
      from a large double blind pivotal trial. METHOD: Data on chronic schizophrenic
      patients who had been hospitalized for at least 60 days (median 351 days) prior
      to entering this 8-week randomized double blind controlled trial were examined.
      This included 75 patients treated with 4 mg of risperidone and 69 treated with
      10mg of haloperidol. Changes in symptoms were assessed with the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) and the Clinical Global
      Impression (CGI). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. RESULTS: The
      analyses revealed that patients receiving risperidone improved significantly more
      than those treated with haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the most
      often prescribed dose of risperidone, 4 mg, might be more effective for long-stay
      chronic schizophrenic patients than haloperidol 10mg.

TI  - Improvement of schizophrenic patients' subjective well-being under atypical
      antipsychotic drugs.
PG  - 79-88
AB  - Recent research indicates that subjective well-being is a major determinant of
      medication compliance in schizophrenia. However, it is yet unresolved whether
      atypical neuroleptics differ regarding subjective side-effects. A self-report
      instrument has been constructed to evaluate 'subjective well-being under
      neuroleptics' (SWN). The primary aims of the present study were to develop a
      short form of the SWN and to investigate the extent to which the atypical
      antipsychotic improves the patient's subjective well-being. The short form of the
      SWN was constructed following an item analysis based on data from 212
      schizophrenic patients medicated with either typical or atypical antipsychotics. 
      The short form of the SWN showed sufficient internal consistency and good
      construct validity. The SWN was only moderately correlated with positive and
      negative syndrome scale (PANSS) scores or changes in psychopathology (r=-0.20 to 
      -0.37). SWN-ratings in patients receiving olanzapine were superior compared to
      those of patients medicated with either clozapine or risperidone on three of five
      domains of well-being. Clozapine reduced global psychiatric symptoms
      significantly more than risperidone. It is concluded that the assessment of
      subjective well-being under antipsychotic treatment provides an independent
      outcome measure which is relevant to compliance.

PG  - 41-53
AB  - Topographic quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) power and frequency
      indices were collected in 17 treatment refractory, DSM-III diagnosed
      schizophrenic patients, before and after acute (single dose) and chronic (six
      weeks) clozapine treatment, as well as in 17 healthy volunteers. Prior to
      treatment, patients exhibited greater overall absolute theta power, slower mean
      alpha frequency and elevated absolute delta and total power in anterior regions. 
      Acute dosing increased total spectrum power globally, slow wave power
      posteriorally, mean alpha frequency and beta power anteriorally and decreased
      alpha power posteriorally. Six weeks of clozapine treatment significantly reduced
      clinical ratings of positive and negative symptoms as well as symptoms of global 
      psychopathology. Chronic treatment resulted in EEG slowing as shown by decreases 
      in relative alpha power, mean beta/total spectrum frequency and by widespread
      increases in absolute total and delta/theta power. The preliminary findings
      suggest that brain electric profiling may be a promising tool for assessing and
      understanding the central impact of pharmacotherapeutic interventions in
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Weight gain over 4 months in schizophrenia patients: a comparison of olanzapine
      and risperidone.
PG  - 261-7
AB  - Weight gain frequently accompanies treatment with antipsychotics. In order to
      determine whether newer antipsychotic agents differ from each other with respect 
      to weight gain, we compared two cohorts of patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia who
      had newly started treatment with either risperidone or olanzapine. After
      obtaining informed consent, data regarding body weight and height were culled
      from existing medical records of 100 patients (50 patients in each treatment
      group). Baseline body weight, close to the time of starting the new medication,
      and body mass index [BMI = weight (kg)/height (m) squared] were compared to the
      body weight and BMI following 4 months of treatment. There was no significant
      change in mean body weight or BMI in the group treated with risperidone (baseline
      weight = 83.1 kg +/- 20.5, follow-up = 82.8 kg +/- 19.9; matched pair t = 0.66, P
      = n.s.; baseline BMI = 29.6 +/- 9.4, follow-up = 29.5 +/- 9.1; matched pair t =
      0.79, P = n.s.). However, in the group treated with olanzapine, there was a
      significant increase in both mean body weight and BMI (baseline weight = 84.9 kg 
      +/- 25.0, follow-up = 87.1 kg +/- 25.1; matched pair t = 4.62, P < 0.001;
      baseline BMI = 29.5 +/- 7.4, follow-up = 30.3 +/- 7.5; matched pair t = 4.43, P <
      0.001). In this naturalistic study, treatment with olanzapine was associated with
      a mean weight gain of about 2 kg from baseline, in patients with schizophrenia,
      while treatment with risperidone was associated with no mean weight change.

TI  - Detecting improvement in quality of life and symptomatology in schizophrenia.
PG  - 227-34
AB  - Instrument-based scores are often used as outcome measures. However, little is
      known about what changes in scores mean in terms of a clinical assessment of
      improvement or deterioration. The purpose of this report was to determine how
      much change in standard instrument scores represents a clinically detectable
      improvement or deterioration. The Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Study of
      Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia evaluated 423 patients on clozapine or
      haloperidol. Symptoms and quality of life scales were completed at baseline; 6
      weeks; and 3, 6, and 12 months. Among patients judged as "improved" by
      clinicians, the average percentage changes were a 21 percent decrease in Positive
      and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and a 26 percent increase in Quality
      of Life Scale (QLS) scores across all followup periods. The change in mean
      seven-point item scores were -0.46 (PANSS) and 0.23 (QLS). A major gain in
      clinically assessed improvement to "much better" was associated with a 45 percent
      decline in PANSS scores and 50 percent increase in QLS scores (change in mean
      seven-point item scores -0.88 and 0.92, respectively). Thus, modest changes in
      psychometric scales assessing symptoms and quality of life reflect clinically
      detectable improvement.

TI  - A family-based study of the Cys23Ser 5HT2C serotonin receptor polymorphism in
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 236-8
AB  - The 5HT2C receptor has a high affinity for clozapine, a nontypical neuroleptic,
      and has therefore been postulated to play a role in mediating negative symptoms
      and neuroleptic response in schizophrenia. In the current study, the Cys23Ser
      5HT2C serotonin receptor polymorphism was examined for linkage to schizophrenia
      by genotyping 207 nuclear families consisting of both parents and schizophrenic
      child and using the transmission disequilibrium test to examine possible
      preferential transmission of these alleles from 68 heterozygous mothers to their 
      ill child. No evidence was obtained for preferential transmission of the Cys23Ser
      5HT2C alleles in schizophrenia in either of the two main ethnic groups examined
      (German and Palestinian Arab) or in the combined cohort (TDT chi-square = 0.00,
      NS).

AB  - The cholinesterase inhibitors provide the first clearly effective treatments for 
      the cognitive deficits of AD and appear to have a beneficial effect on activities
      of daily living function and noncognitive behavior. There is increasing support
      for starting donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine early in the disease course 
      and maintaining treatment at least during the early and middle stages of AD.
      Depressive signs and symptoms complicating AD are treated best with SSRIs.
      Placebo-controlled trials support the use of citalopram and sertraline in AD
      complicated by depression. The atypical antipsychotics are the first choice for
      managing psychosis and disruptive agitation in AD and particularly in the Lewy
      body variant of AD. Studies suggest that low-dose treatment with risperidone, 1
      mg/d, or olanzapine, 5 mg/d, offers the optimal ratio of therapeutic to adverse
      effects.

TI  - Olanzapine-induced diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 563-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of new-onset diabetes mellitus resulting after the
      initiation of olanzapine treatment. CASE SUMMARY: A 31-year-old African American 
      man and a 44-year-old white man, both with schizoaffective disorder, developed
      diabetes mellitus within weeks or months of olanzapine initiation. DISCUSSION:
      Our reports of new-onset diabetes due to olanzapine are consistent with those in 
      the literature. Although the mechanism is not yet known, it has been hypothesized
      that perhaps damage to the pancreatic islet cells, weight gain, dysregulation of 
      the sympathetic system, and insulin resistance are contributing factors.
      CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus secondary to olanzapine use seems to be a rare
      occurrence. However, certain risk factors such as obesity, family history, and
      concomitant medications may predispose an individual to development of diabetes
      mellitus while taking olanzapine. An increased awareness of this reaction is
      essential in the treatment of patients at risk. Periodic serum glucose monitoring
      in these individuals may be warranted.

TI  - Special issues in the treatment of paediatric bipolar disorder.
PG  - 613-22
AB  - Paediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is an increasingly diagnosed disorder affecting
      an estimated 1% of children and adolescents. Pharmacological treatment studies in
      PBD have lagged far behind those in adults. Children are currently treated with
      pharmacological agents, most of which have proven efficacy in adults. However,
      PBD is distinct from adult forms of bipolar disorder (BD) and may present unique 
      treatment challenges. PBD often presents with rapid cycling and mixed manic
      states and a high co-morbidity with behavioural and attention disorders. Early
      onset depression may also be an early sign of PBD. Due to developmental
      considerations, the diagnosis of BD may be difficult to make in children without 
      semi-structured interviews. This report discusses the special issues that should 
      be considered when treating PBD and reviews the current literature regarding
      pharmacotherapy of this population. Mood stabilisers have been studied mostly in 
      an open, uncontrolled fashion but there is growing evidence that lithium,
      divalproex and carbamazepine are effective in treating PBD. More recent treatment
      options include atypical antipsychotics and newer anticonvulsants. Other novel
      agents are currently being investigated in adult BD and may prove applicable to
      the paediatric form. Finally, based on the available data, a treatment algorithm 
      for PBD is proposed.

TI  - [Incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms during treatment with olanzapine,
      haloperidol and risperidone: results of an observational study].
PG  - 25-32
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and the
      concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs in outpatients diagnosed of
      schizophrenia treated with olanzapine (OLZ) in comparison with haloperidol (HAL) 
      and risperidone (RIS) under routine clinical practice conditions. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: The analysis was carried out on the basis of the information obtained in
      the EFESO study, an observational, prospective study carried out in outpatients
      diagnosed of schizophrenia and treated with olanzapine compared to other
      antipsychotic agents used in the clinical practice. The incidence of EPS in the
      OLZ treated group compared to the haloperidol and risperidone treatment groups in
      which over 100 patients were included is analyzed in the present work. The study 
      duration was 6 months and the data were collected by 293 psychiatrists from
      mental health care areas. RESULTS: The percentage of patients who presented at
      least one adverse event (AE) (p 3/4 0.001) was less in the OLZ groups (47.8%)
      compared to those of the HAL (79.8%) and RIS (57.2%) subgroups. A lower
      percentage of patients treated with OLZ (36.9%) presented EPS in comparison to
      the RIS (49.6%) and HAL (76%) subgroups (p 3/4 0.001). A lower rate of patients
      from the OLZ group (10.2%) received anticholinergic treatments compared to the
      RIS (19.9%) and HAL (44%) subgroups (p< 0.001 in both cases). CONCLUSIONS:
      OLZ-treated patients presented a lower incidence of EPS and required less
      anticholinergic treatment than the HAL and RIS treated patients. These results,
      obtained in naturalistic conditions, coincide with the conclusions reached in
      randomized clinical trials carried out prior to the marketing of OLZ.

TI  - [Subjective and objective evaluation of treating schizophrenia with classic or
      atypical drugs].
PG  - 5-19
AB  - Subjective and objective evaluation of pharmacological treatment was made in 105 
      schizophrenic in-patients. PANSS and Calgary scale as well as Van Putten scale
      were used. Fifty-four percent of subjects received classic neuroleptics and
      46%--new atypical drugs for an average period of 8 weeks. The severity of
      schizophrenic symptoms during treatment as well as subjective evaluation of first
      effects of the drug did not differ among subjects treated with classic or
      atypical drugs. Depressive symptoms decreased significantly during treatment with
      atypicals but not with classic drugs. Also a significant decrease of depression
      was found under olanzapine treatment. The severity of neuroleptic-induced
      side-effects did not differ in both groups. Neurological side effects were more
      prominent in subjects after 4 weeks of therapy with risperidone, in comparison to
      patients receiving olanzapine. Forty-seven per-cent of patients showed a
      dysphoric reaction to the first dose of medication. After treatment with atypical
      drugs, better subjective evaluation of pharmacotherapy correlated with less
      severe general and depressive schizophrenia symptoms. Patients' better evaluation
      of olanzapine treatment correlated with less severe schizophrenic general
      symptomatology. The subjective evaluation of treatment was better in patients
      with less severe neurological side-effects of atypical drugs (including
      olanzapine but not risperidone) and less severe autonomic side-effects of classic
      drugs. The evaluation of pharmacotherapy made by patients' family members did not
      correlate with subjects' opinions after distribution of the first dose of the
      drugs, but correlated significantly with patients' opinion after 8-weeks of
      treatment. The treatment received by the patients was judged better by the family
      members if less severe neurological side-effects were present.

AB  - Cognitive impairment in multiple domains is common in patients with schizophrenia
      and may be a powerful determinant of poor functional ability and quality of life.
      We report a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of donepezil
      augmentation in a schizoaffective disorder patient stabilized on olanzapine
      pharmacotherapy. The patient showed significant improvements in several cognitive
      measures and increased activation of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia on
      functional MRI during the donepezil augmentation. In addition, the donepezil
      augmentation resulted in a reduction of depressive symptoms and in significant
      improvements in functional abilities and quality of life. Further studies of
      donepezil augmentation of neuroleptics in schizophrenia are warranted.

      of therapy. Amantadine (100-300 mg/day) was started in 12 patients having a mean 
      weight gain of 7.3 kg during olanzapine treatment. The patients' weight
      stabilised and over 3-6 months they lost an average of 3.5 kg. No clinical
      deterioration occurred and no adverse effects were reported. These observations
      merit confirmation in randomised, controlled trials.

TI  - Clinical effects of a randomized switch of patients from clozaril to generic
      clozapine.
PG  - 14-7; discussion 23-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clozapine was discovered in 1959 but withheld from the United
      States market after several deaths due to agranulocytosis. The medication was
      approved in the United States in 1989 on a compassionate-use basis and was first 
      marketed in 1990 as Clozaril. In 1999, following approval by the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration, Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals (ZGP) introduced a generic
      form of clozapine. METHOD: After 5 weeks of data collection (phase I), 24
      patients were randomly assigned to group A and 21 patients to group B. Patients
      had DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder
      with psychosis, or atypical psychosis with mood disorder. In phase II, group A
      received a mean daily dose of 630 mg of generic clozapine, and group B continued 
      to receive Clozaril at a mean daily dose of 610 mg, each for 8 weeks. In phase
      III, group A was reassigned to Clozaril, and group B was switched to generic
      clozapine, each for 8 weeks. At the end of phase III, group B resumed Clozaril.
      Efficacy was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I)
      scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Beck Depression
      Inventory (BDI). RESULTS: Five patients experienced relapse when they were
      switched from Clozaril to generic clozapine. Eleven patients worsened short of
      full relapse, 9 while receiving ZGP generic clozapine and 2 while receiving
      Clozaril. CGI-I scores and BPRS scores favored patients receiving Clozaril
      significantly. Only BDI scores favored patients receiving generic clozapine
      significantly. CONCLUSION: Until more studies have been performed, clinicians and
      administrators should carefully monitor stable Clozaril-treated patients who are 
      being switched to generic clozapine.

TI  - Analysis of the QTc interval during olanzapine treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia and related psychosis.
PG  - 191-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: There may be a temporal association between some antipsychotics and
      prolongation of the heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) representing a delay
      in ventricular repolarization. QTc prolongation significantly exceeding normal
      intra-individual and interindividual variation may increase the risk of
      ventricular tachydysrhythmias, especially torsade de pointes, and therefore,
      sudden cardiac death. METHOD: Electrocardiogram recordings obtained as part of
      the safety assessment of olanzapine in 4 controlled, randomized clinical trials
      (N = 2,700) were analyzed. These analyses were conducted to characterize any
      change in QTc temporally associated with olanzapine, compared with placebo,
      haloperidol, and risperidone, in acutely psychotic patients (DSM-III-R and
      DSM-IV) and to characterize variability and temporal course of the QTc in this
      patient population. Changes from baseline to minimum and maximum QTc were tested 
      for significance, and baseline to acute-phase endpoint change in mean QTc was
      tested for significance within treatments and for differences between olanzapine 
      and comparators. The possibility of a linear relationship between dose of
      olanzapine and mean change in QTc, as well as incidence of treatment-emergent
      prolongation of QTc (change from < 430 msec at baseline to > or =430 msec at
      endpoint), was tested. RESULTS: The incidence of maximum QTc > or = 450 msec
      during treatment was approximately equal to the incidence of QTc > or =450 msec
      at baseline. CONCLUSION: Results of these analyses suggest that olanzapine, as
      therapeutically administered to patients with schizophrenia and related
      psychoses, does not contribute to QTc prolongation resulting in potentially fatal
      ventricular arrhythmias.

TI  - Risperidone liquid concentrate and oral lorazepam versus intramuscular
      haloperidol and intramuscular lorazepam for treatment of psychotic agitation.
PG  - 153-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although agitation associated with psychosis is a common presentation
      in the psychiatric emergency service, there is no consensus concerning the best
      treatment. Standard treatment often consists of intramuscular (i.m.) injection of
      high-potency neuroleptics, sometimes combined with benzodiazepines. The objective
      of this study was to determine the relative efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      oral risperidone versus intramuscular haloperidol, both in combination with
      lorazepam, for the emergency treatment of psychotic agitation in patients who are
      able to accept oral medications. METHOD: A convenience sample of psychotic
      patients admitted to a large psychiatric emergency service who required emergency
      medication for the control of agitation and/or violence was offered risperidone
      (2 mg liquid concentrate) and oral lorazepam (2 mg) as an alternative to standard
      care at the institution, haloperidol (5 mg i.m.) and lorazepam (2 mg i.m.).
      Subjects who refused the oral medications were given the intramuscular treatment 
      as a component of routine care. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled in each
      treatment group. Although men were significantly more likely to choose oral
      medication (chi2 = 5.165, p < .023), other demographic characteristics did not
      differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups. Both groups showed similar
      improvement in agitation as measured by 5 agitation subscales of the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, and
      time to sedation. No patients receiving risperidone demonstrated any side effects
      or adverse events, while 1 patient receiving intramuscular treatment with
      haloperidol developed acute dystonia. One subject receiving risperidone required 
      subsequent treatment with haloperidol for ongoing agitation. CONCLUSION: Oral
      treatment with risperidone and lorazepam appears to be a tolerable and comparable
      alternative to intramuscular haloperidol and lorazepam for short-term treatment
      of agitated psychosis in patients who accept oral medications.

TI  - Adjunctive gabapentin in patients with intellectual disability and bipolar
      spectrum disorders.
PG  - 139-45
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of adjunctive gabapentin 
      (GBP) in the treatment of patients with intellectual disability (ID) and bipolar 
      spectrum disorders. Ten affected subjects with demonstrable increases in
      symptomatology during 'significant' life events which had interfered with or
      induced the interruption of their rehabilitation programmes were chosen for this 
      study. The meaning of 'significant' was defined for each patient as a frequently 
      repeated life event which had elicited a marked increase in symptoms on at least 
      two occasions. Gabapentin (300-900 mg day-1) was added to the standard therapy.
      The subjects' psychopathological conditions during the significant life event
      were assessed by means of standardized tools both before and after adjunctive
      therapy with GBP. A positive response to therapy was observed, with subsequent
      improvement of psychopathological conditions, particularly for anxiety and
      depressive symptoms. The promising results obtained with GBP suggest the need for
      further trials. Adjunctive GBP may become an alternative treatment approach for
      patients with ID in whom traditional mood-stabilizing agents have frequent
      contraindications.

TI  - Subjective response to and tolerability of long-term supraphysiological doses of 
      levothyroxine in refractory mood disorders.
PG  - 35-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although supplementation with supraphysiological doses of
      levothyroxine (T4) has been an effective treatment for refractory affective
      disorders in open studies, questions remain as to the tolerability of this
      treatment. This is the first study to investigate subjective patient response and
      tolerability to long-term treatment with adjunctive T4. METHODS: Of 24 patients
      with refractory affective disorders or schizoaffective disorder who were
      consecutively included into an open trial with supraphysiological T4, 16 were
      eligible for this study. Four measures were used to rate tolerability to T4
      treatment. Subjective response was graded on a scale ranging from -33 (maximal
      negative response) to +33 (maximal positive response). Positive and negative
      effects were assessed on a structured questionnaire. Clinical tolerance was
      assessed with the clinician-rated Thyroid Symptom List and the self-rated Von
      Zerssen Complaint Lists. Outcome was assessed with the CGI for prophylactic
      ratings (CGI-BP). RESULTS: At the time of assessment, patients had been treated
      with supraphysiological T4 (mean dose 368 microg/d) for a mean of 54 months. The 
      total subjective response score was +25.2. Positive subjective response and
      observer-rated treatment success were moderately correlated. Ratings on the
      Thyroid Symptom List indicated an overall favorable side effect profile. General 
      physical and mental symptoms were only slightly higher than in the general
      population. LIMITATIONS: This was an open, cross-sectional study that only
      included responders and partial responders to T4 treatment. CONCLUSIONS:
      Subjective response and side-effect tolerability of long-term supraphysiological 
      doses of T4 is favorable in patients with refractory mood and schizoaffective
      disorders who respond to the intervention.

TI  - Short-term inpatient pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia.
PG  - 89-104
AB  - There is much practice variation in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia on
      short-term acute inpatient units, where the length of stay may be 1 week or less.
      We surveyed relevant practice guidelines, review articles, and individual studies
      and developed summary statements regarding evidence-supported procedures for
      short-term inpatient stabilization. If the patient requires parenteral treatment,
      the combination of intramuscular haloperidol 2-5 mg and lorazepam has the
      earliest effect. For initial oral treatment, monotherapy with one of the new
      "atypical" antipsychotics is favored. Some evidence suggests that risperidone may
      have an earlier onset of action. Olanzapine seems to have a relatively more rapid
      effect when started at a daily dose of 15 mg, rather than 5 or 10 mg. The role of
      quetiapine is somewhat unclear. In the event of nonresponse to the initial
      antipsychotic after 3-7 days, alternatives may include increasing the dose,
      switching to a different antipsychotic, or adding a mood stabilizer.

TI  - An MRI study of basal ganglia volumes in first-episode schizophrenia patients
      treated with risperidone.
PG  - 625-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The basal ganglia may contribute to extrapyramidal movement disorders,
      affective disturbances, and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Basal ganglia
      volumes are putatively affected by antipsychotic medications. The purpose of this
      study was to determine the long-term effects of risperidone treatment in a cohort
      of first-episode patients with schizophrenia. METHOD: The subjects were 30
      patients with first-episode schizophrenia, 12 patients chronically treated with
      typical antipsychotics, and 23 healthy comparison subjects. They were scanned by 
      magnetic resonance imaging at baseline. The first-episode patients received 1
      year of continuous risperidone treatment, after which they and the comparison
      subjects were rescanned. Caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus volumes were
      determined from coronal images. RESULTS: The baseline caudate, putamen, and
      globus pallidus volumes were significantly larger in the chronically treated
      patients than in the untreated first-episode subjects and comparison subjects.
      These volumes did not differ between the first-episode patients and healthy
      comparison subjects. Basal ganglia volumes were unchanged after 1 year of
      exposure to risperidone in the first-episode subjects. Extrapyramidal movement
      disorders were present in the majority of chronically treated patients and more
      than one-third of the never-medicated first-episode patients at baseline.
      CONCLUSIONS: This group of first-episode patients did not exhibit abnormalities
      of basal ganglia volumes, nor were basal ganglia volumes affected by exposure to 
      risperidone. Movement disorders were observed in both first-episode and
      chronically treated patients, suggesting effects of both illness and medications.

TI  - Effectiveness of second-generation antipsychotics in patients with
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a review and meta-analysis of randomized
      trials.
PG  - 518-26
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a review and meta-analysis of studies that
      compared the efficacy and tolerability of typical and second-generation
      antipsychotics for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. METHOD: A
      systematic search revealed 12 controlled studies (involving 1,916 independent
      patients), which were included in the review. For the seven studies that compared
      clozapine to a typical antipsychotic, a meta-analysis was performed to examine
      clozapine's effects on overall psychopathology, response rate, extrapyramidal
      symptoms, and tardive dyskinesia. RESULTS: The meta-analysis confirmed that
      treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients have more favorable outcomes when
      treated with clozapine rather than a typical antipsychotic, as reflected by Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale total score, categorical response rate, Scale for the
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms score, Simpson-Angus Rating Scale score, and
      compliance rate. Clozapine also conferred benefits on the sickest
      treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients. Patients treated with olanzapine also
      had more favorable outcomes with regard to categorical response and compliance
      rates. CONCLUSIONS: In the aggregate, the results of a meta-analysis indicated
      that clozapine exhibits superiority over typical antipsychotics in terms of both 
      efficacy (as measured by improvement in overall psychopathology) and safety (in
      terms of reduced extrapyramidal side effects). However, the magnitude of the
      clozapine treatment effect was not consistently robust. Efficacy data for other
      second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment of patients with refractory
      schizophrenia were inconclusive. There is, therefore, a growing need to consider 
      new and different treatment strategies, whether they be adjunctive or
      monotherapeutic, for schizophrenia that continues to be resistant or only
      partially responsive to treatment.

TI  - Estrogen - a potential treatment for schizophrenia.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - Estrogen has been shown in animal studies to modulate both the dopamine and
      serotonin neurotransmitter systems - the main neurotransmitters implicated in the
      pathogenesis of schizophrenia. A double blind, 28 day, placebo-controlled study
      was conducted with three groups of women of child-bearing age (N=12 in each
      group) who received standardized antipsychotic medication plus 50mcg transdermal 
      estradiol or 100mcg transdermal estradiol or transdermal placebo. Analyses show
      that women receiving 100mcg of estradiol made greater improvements in the
      symptoms of schizophrenia than both the 50mcg estradiol and placebo groups. Women
      receiving 50mcg estradiol had more improvement in their symptoms compared with
      the placebo group. The 100mcg estradiol group had significantly lower mean
      lutenizing hormone (LH) and higher mean prolactin levels across the study period 
      compared with both the 50mcg and placebo groups. The addition of 100mcg
      adjunctive transdermal estrogen significantly enhanced the treatment of acute,
      severe psychotic symptoms in women with schizophrenia. The differential response 
      of adding 50mcg versus 100mcg estradiol on the types of symptom affected may be
      related to the estrogen effect on LH and prolactin. The positive impact of
      estrogen treatment on psychotic symptoms by a direct effect on dopamine and
      serotonin systems or via an indirect prolactin-mediated effect may be very useful
      in the overall treatment of women with schizophrenia.

TI  - Antipsychotic prescription use and costs for persons with schizophrenia in the
      1990s: current trends and five year time series forecasts.
PG  - 281-92
AB  - Real advances in schizophrenia pharmacotherapy have been made over this decade
      with the development of more efficacious treatment options with fewer
      side-effects. These advances have high per-unit direct costs that may have a
      profound effect on drug budgets of systems caring for persons with schizophrenia.
      The objective of this study was to describe the changes in utilization and cost
      for antipsychotic prescriptions by atypical, clozapine, decanoate products, and
      traditional neuroleptics in a large naturalistic setting, i.e. the Georgia
      Medicaid population. Secondly, this study forecasted the categorized
      antipsychotic prescription utilization through the year 2002. Administrative
      claims data spanning 1990-1997 for Medicaid eligible persons suffering from
      schizophrenia in the state of Georgia were supplemented with psychiatric
      institutional data obtained from the Georgia Department of Human Resources. A
      total of 16227 Medicaid-eligible recipients had a code indicative of
      schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM=295.(**)) and were at least 16 years of age at the time
      of their first diagnosis. The mean recipient prescription use and expenditures
      were tallied for each month of the study and stratified by prescription category 
      (atypical, clozapine, decanoate, and traditional antipsychotic). ARIMA time
      series models were identified and estimated using these monthly PMPM utilization 
      and expenditures estimates to forecast 5 years beyond the last month of the
      study. The total use of antipsychotics increased modestly throughout the study
      period, and the use of atypicals, clozapine, and decanoate products increased
      substantially, while a decrease was observed for traditional antipsychotics. In
      1995 dollars, antipsychotic expenditures increased from a mean of approximately
      $10 PMPM in 1990 to $95 projected for the year 2002. This transition from
      traditional oral antipsychotics to atypicals and decanoate products has a
      profound effect on drug expenditures for systems paying for the care of persons
      with schizophrenia. Further studies to determine the value of the transitions of 
      therapy described in this study need to be evaluated using a system-wide- or
      Medicaid perspective.

TI  - Neuroleptic treatment of late-life schizophrenia.
PG  - 77-83
AB  - There is a paucity of studies on the use of neuroleptic medication for treatment 
      of the core symptoms of schizophrenia in elderly patients. The studies that are
      available have significant methodologic problems, including the mixing of early- 
      and late-onset patients, inadequate outcome criteria, and the lack of control
      groups. Studies of conventional neuroleptics suggest that older patients have a
      moderate therapeutic response but are likely to develop side effects. The few
      studies of atypical antipsychotics now available suggest efficacy for treatment
      of behavioral disturbance in the elderly and a more favorable side-effect
      profile. The usefulness of all neuroleptics for the treatment of the core
      symptoms of late-life schizophrenia may depend on the duration and severity of
      the symptoms, with a poor response associated with greater severity and duration.
      It appears that patients with later-onset symptoms may respond better to all
      neuroleptics.

AB  - The rapid and safe reduction of manic symptoms is an important initial goal of
      the pharmacologic treatment of acute mania. The pharmacokinetics and studies of
      pharmacologic loading of lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine were reviewed. In 
      addition, the feasibility of administering other agents with potential efficacy
      in mania, e.g., atypical antipsychotics and new anticonvulsants, was discussed.
      Further double-blind, controlled studies with adequate sample sizes comparing
      loading strategies with more gradual titration schedules of candidate antimanic
      agents are needed.

TI  - The evaluation of multiple surrogate endpoints.
PG  - 81-7
AB  - Surrogate endpoints are desirable because they typically result in smaller,
      faster efficacy studies compared with the ones using the clinical endpoints.
      Research on surrogate endpoints has received substantial attention lately, but
      most investigations have focused on the validity of using a single biomarker as a
      surrogate. Our paper studies whether the use of multiple markers can improve
      inferences about a treatment's effects on a clinical endpoint. We propose a joint
      model for a time to clinical event and for repeated measures over time on
      multiple biomarkers that are potential surrogates. This model extends the
      formulation of Xu and Zeger (2001, in press) and Fawcett and Thomas (1996,
      Statistics in Medicine 15, 1663-1685). We propose two complementary measures of
      the relative benefit of multiple surrogates as opposed to a single one. Markov
      chain Monte Carlo is implemented to estimate model parameters. The methodology is
      illustrated with an analysis of data from a schizophrenia clinical trial.

TI  - The new atypical antipsychotics: a review of pharmacoeconomic studies.
PG  - 249-60
AB  - The pharmacoeconomic evaluation of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of
      schizophrenia involves documentation of clinical effectiveness, quality of life
      and medical cost outcomes. The findings of pharmacoeconomic studies assist
      psychiatrists and mental healthcare decision-makers in identifying therapies that
      provide the greatest benefit to patients at the most acceptable cost. The
      cost-effectiveness of the newer atypical antipsychotics has been examined using
      non-controlled cohort studies (either retrospective or prospective), modelling
      studies or randomised clinical trials. The evidence, from a variety of studies,
      indicates that clozapine is a cost-effective treatment for neuroleptic refractory
      schizophrenia. Risperidone and olanzapine may be cost neutral, or at best
      slightly cost saving, compared with conventional antipsychotics, although they do
      improve patient clinical effectiveness and quality of life outcomes. There is too
      little data on pharmacoeconomic outcomes for sertindole and quetiapine to make
      any conclusions about their cost-effectiveness in treating schizophrenia.

TI  - Adjunctive gabapentin in treatment-resistant depression: a retrospective chart
      review.
PG  - 243-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies in predominantly bipolar patients have suggested
      that gabapentin may be useful in treating mood disorders. This report describes
      its efficacy and tolerability as an adjunctive agent in treatment-resistant
      depression. METHODS: A chart review was conducted on 27 outpatients presenting
      with a depressive disorder in whom gabapentin was added to ongoing treatment with
      a conventional antidepressant to which patients had not responded after at least 
      6 weeks. The majority of patients had either prominent anxiety or a history of
      soft bipolar features, but patients with bipolar I disorder were excluded.
      Clinical state and adverse effects were assessed retrospectively at each visit.
      RESULTS: Mean gabapentin trial duration was 15.2+/-7.8 weeks, with a mean final
      dose of 904+/-445 mg/day (range, 300-1800 mg/day). Clinician-rated measures of
      clinical state improved significantly from baseline to endpoint. Overall, 37.0%
      (n=10) of patients were responders at endpoint; another 18.5% (n=5) manifested a 
      transient response not sustained to endpoint. Gabapentin was well tolerated; the 
      most common adverse effects were fatigue, sedation, dizziness, and
      gastrointestinal symptoms. LIMITATIONS: Treatment was uncontrolled and efficacy
      assessments were retrospective. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that
      gabapentin may be of adjunctive benefit in the management of treatment-resistant 
      depression.

TI  - Tolerability and effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics in male geriatric
      inpatients.
PG  - 223-7
AB  - The atypical antipsychotics are gradually becoming the mainstay of treatment for 
      psychosis in the elderly. The present study examines the effectiveness and
      tolerability of risperidone and olanzapine treatment in 34 matched male patients 
      admitted to a VA Medical Center geriatric inpatient unit. The Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation 
      Inventory (CMAI), the Rating Scale for Side-Effects, the Extra-Pyramidal Rating
      Scale, and the Mini-Mental State Examination were administered at admission and
      discharge. T-tests at admission and discharge across groups indicate that the
      patients as a whole were performing significantly better following their stay on 
      the CMAI (t(30)=4.31, p=0.000), the GAF (t(31)=9.73, p=0.000), the PANSS total
      score (t(29)=3.82, p=0.001), and the positive symptom portion of the PANSS
      (t(28)=4.29, p=0.000). No significant differences were detected between the two
      groups with regard to length of hospitalization, or reduction in scores on the
      PANSS, or CMAI, however the daily cost of risperidone was 1/3 as much as
      olanzapine (p=0.00). The two treatments were comparable in the elderly men
      evaluated in this study.

TI  - Pindolol augmentation in aggressive schizophrenic patients: a double-blind
      crossover randomized study.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - Treatment of aggression in schizophrenic patients is a major challenge. We sought
      to examine the efficacy of augmentation of antipsychotic treatment with pindolol 
      in the amelioration of aggression. Thirty male inpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria
      for schizophrenia, aged 20-65 years involved in four or more aggressive incidents
      in the two previous months, were enrolled in a double-blind crossover study.
      Aggression was evaluated per incident, with the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS).
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was administered at baseline,
      crossover and at endpoint. Patients received either pindolol or placebo
      augmentation 5 mg x three times a day until crossover, then switched. No
      significant differences were found in the PANSS scores between the placebo and
      pindolol treatments. OAS scores were significantly reduced for number of
      aggressive incidents towards objects and other persons during pindolol treatment 
      (0.59 versus 1.46, F = 6.09, P < 0.02; 1.96 versus 3.23, F = 4.17, P < 0.05,
      respectively). Similar results were obtained for severity of incidents (0.89
      versus 3.58, F = 19.42, P < 0.0001; 2.89 versus 6.85, F = 10.11, P < 0.004,
      respectively). Pindolol, with its dual beta and 5-HT1A blocking effect
      ameliorated both number and severity of aggressive acts. Influence on severity
      may be associated with a 5-HT1A antagonistic effect.

TI  - Bodyweight gain with atypical antipsychotics. A comparative review.
PG  - 59-73
AB  - The atypical antipsychotics have been shown to have superior efficacy compared
      with typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol, particularly in the treatment of
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Furthermore, they induce less extrapyramidal 
      effects. However, following clinical use, marked bodyweight gain has been
      frequently observed with some of the atypical antipsychotic drugs. In order to
      examine and compare the frequency, amount and conditions of bodyweight gain
      during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, studies concerning bodyweight gain
      with these agents were identified through a MEDLINE search from 1966 to March
      2000. Although comparison is limited by the different designs and recruitment
      procedures of the reviewed studies, the available data support the notion that
      the frequency as well as the amount of bodyweight gain is high in patients
      treated with olanzapine (average bodyweight gain 2.3 kg/month), clozapine (1.7
      kg/month), quetiapine (1.8 kg/month), and possibly also zotepine (2.3 kg/month). 
      Moderate changes in bodyweight have been observed in the treatment with
      risperidone (average bodyweight gain 1.0 kg/month). Ziprasidone seems to induce
      only slight bodyweight changes (0.8 kg/month). Bodyweight gain most frequently
      occurs in the first 12 weeks of treatment. Patients who were underweight at the
      beginning of treatment are at highest risk of gaining bodyweight. The underlying 
      pathomechanism still remains largely unclear. The relative receptor affinities of
      the atypical antipsychotics for histamine H1 receptors as well as the ratio of
      their affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptors appear to be the
      most robust correlate of bodyweight gain. Furthermore, the induction of leptin
      secretion may have an important impact on bodyweight gain in patients treated
      with atypical antipsychotics. Although many questions concerning the pathogenesis
      of bodyweight gain remain unresolved, this adverse effect has to be taken into
      consideration when prescribing the atypical antipsychotics, particularly in view 
      its affect on compliance during long term treatment and the long term effects of 
      obesity on mortality and morbidity.

TI  - Olanzapine: an updated review of its use in the management of schizophrenia.
PG  - 111-61
AB  - Olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine derivative, is a second generation (atypical) 
      antipsychotic agent which has proven efficacy against the positive and negative
      symptoms of schizophrenia. Compared with conventional antipsychotics, it has
      greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A than for dopamine D2 receptors. In large,
      well controlled trials in patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses,
      olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day was significantly superior to haloperidol 5 to 20
      mg/day in overall improvements in psychopathology rating scales and in the
      treatment of depressive and negative symptoms, and was comparable in effects on
      positive psychotic symptoms. The 1-year risk of relapse (rehospitalisation) was
      significantly lower with olanzapine than with haloperidol treatment. In the first
      double-blind comparative study (28-week) of olanzapine and risperidone,
      olanzapine 10 to 20 mg/day proved to be significantly more effective than
      risperidone 4 to 12 mg/day in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms
      but not on overall psychopathology symptoms. In contrast, preliminary results
      from an 8-week controlled study suggested risperidone 2 to 6 mg/day was superior 
      to olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day against positive and anxiety/depressive symptoms (p 
      < 0.05), although consistent with the first study, both agents demonstrated
      similar efficacy on measures of overall psychopathology. Improvements in general 
      cognitive function seen with olanzapine treatment in a 1-year controlled study of
      patients with early-phase schizophrenia, were significantly greater than changes 
      seen with either risperidone or haloperidol. However, preliminary results from an
      8-week trial showed comparable cognitive enhancing effects of olanzapine and
      risperidone treatment in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
      Several studies indicate that olanzapine has benefits against symptoms of
      aggression and agitation, while other studies strongly support the effectiveness 
      of olanzapine in the treatment of depressive symptomatology. Olanzapine is
      associated with significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol and 
      risperidone. In addition, olanzapine is not associated with a risk of
      agranulocytosis as seen with clozapine or clinically significant
      hyperprolactinaemia as seen with risperidone or prolongation of the QT interval. 
      The most common adverse effects reported with olanzapine are bodyweight gain,
      somnolence, dizziness, anticholinergic effects (constipation and dry mouth) and
      transient asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations. In comparison with haloperidol,
      the adverse events reported significantly more frequently with olanzapine in > or
      = 3.5% of patients were dry mouth, bodyweight gain and increased appetite and
      compared with risperidone, only bodyweight gain occurred significantly more
      frequently with olanzapine. The high acquisition cost of olanzapine is offset by 
      reductions in other treatment costs (inpatient and/or outpatient services) of
      schizophrenia. Pharmacoeconomic analyses indicate that olanzapine does not
      significantly increase, and may even decrease, the overall direct treatment costs
      of schizophrenia, compared with haloperidol. Compared with risperidone,
      olanzapine has also been reported to decrease overall treatment costs, despite
      the several-fold higher daily acquisition cost of the drug. Olanzapine treatment 
      improves quality of life in patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses to 
      a greater extent than haloperidol, and to broadly the same extent as risperidone.
      CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine demonstrated superior antipsychotic efficacy compared
      with haloperidol in the treatment of acute phase schizophrenia, and in the
      treatment of some patients with first-episode or treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. The reduced risk of adverse events and therapeutic superiority
      compared with haloperidol and risperidone in the treatment of negative and
      depressive symptoms support the choice of olanzapine as a first-line option in
      the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for the maintenance of
      treatment response.

TI  - Clozapine for the treatment of drug-induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease:
      results of the 12 week open label extension in the PSYCLOPS trial.
PG  - 135-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the results of the 12-week, prospective, open label
      extension of the 4-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind PSYCLOPS
      (PSYchosis and CLOzapine in the treatment of Parkinsonism) trial. This extension 
      examined the chronic safety and efficacy of clozapine in the treatment of
      drug-induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). BACKGROUND: Psychosis is a
      serious late complication of PD and may be a harbinger to increased mortality.
      Clozapine, the first atypical antipsychotic, was shown in several small open
      label studies to improve psychosis without worsening of motor symptoms. This was 
      recently confirmed in the double-blind PSYCLOPS trial. METHODS: The 53 patients
      who completed the double-blind portion of PSYCLOPS were evaluated on their
      original randomized treatment (clozapine or placebo), then had study medication
      stopped. All were started on clozapine. The patients from both treatment groups
      were evaluated every 4 weeks over a 12-week period using standardized measures
      for psychosis and PD. RESULTS: The mean dose of clozapine was 28.78 mg/day. Those
      originally treated with placebo improved significantly in Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale and clinical global scores for psychosis to the same degree as the
      group originally randomized to clozapine in the double-blind study. Both groups
      maintained their response to week 16 (end of the combined double-blind and open
      label portions). There was no worsening of motor features as measured by the
      Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale. Eighteen patients were either
      hospitalized or died during the trial. The most common reasons were pulmonary.
      CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose clozapine is effective in treating drug-induced psychosis
      without worsening motor features of PD, and the response is maintained for at
      least 4 months. Patients with psychosis and PD were previously described as a
      group with high risk for morbidity and mortality. The high risk continues despite
      antipsychotic therapy.

TI  - Intramuscular ziprasidone compared with intramuscular haloperidol in the
      treatment of acute psychosis. Ziprasidone I.M. Study Group.
PG  - 933-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: This 7-day, randomized, open-label, multicenter, international study 
      compared the efficacy and tolerability of intramuscular (i.m.) ziprasidone with
      haloperidol i.m. and the transition from i.m. to oral treatment in hospitalized
      patients with acute psychotic agitation (related to DSM-III-R diagnoses). METHOD:
      Patients received up to 3 days of flexible-dose ziprasidone i.m. (N = 90) or
      haloperidol i.m. (N = 42) followed by oral treatment to day 7. After an initial
      ziprasidone i.m. dose of 10 mg, subsequent i.m. doses of 5 to 20 mg could be
      given every 4 to 6 hours (maximum daily dose = 80 mg) if needed, followed by oral
      ziprasidone, 80-200 mg/day. Haloperidol i.m. doses of 2.5 to 10 mg were given on 
      entry, followed by 2.5 to 10 mg i.m. every 4 to 6 hours (maximum daily dose = 40 
      mg) if needed, then by oral haloperidol, 10-80 mg/day. RESULTS: The mean
      reductions in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, BPRS agitation items, 
      and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale scores were statistically
      significantly greater (p < .05, p < .01, and p < .01, respectively) after
      ziprasidone i.m. treatment compared with haloperidol i.m. treatment. Further
      reductions in these scores also occurred in both groups following transition to
      oral treatment. Ziprasidone was associated with a lower incidence of movement
      disorders and a reduced requirement for anticholinergic medication during both
      i.m. and oral treatment compared with haloperidol. Movement disorder scale scores
      improved with ziprasidone i.m. and oral treatment, but deteriorated with
      haloperidol. Other adverse events were rare with both treatments. CONCLUSION:
      Ziprasidone i.m. was significantly more effective in reducing the symptoms of
      acute psychosis and was better tolerated than haloperidol i.m., particularly in
      movement disorders. The transition from ziprasidone i.m. to oral ziprasidone was 
      effective and well tolerated.

TI  - Relationship between plasma risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations
      and clinical response in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 238-43
AB  - RATIONALE: Evaluation of relationships between serum antipsychotic drug
      concentrations and clinical response may provide valuable information for
      rational dosage adjustments. For risperidone, this relationship has been little
      investigated to date. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between plasma
      concentrations of risperidone and its active 9-hydroxy-metabolite
      (9-OH-risperidone) and clinical response in schizophrenic patients who
      experienced an acute exacerbation of the disorder. METHODS: Forty-two patients
      (30 males, 12 females, age 24-60 years) were given risperidone at dosages ranging
      from 4 to 9 mg/day for 6 weeks. The design of the study was open and risperidone 
      dosage could be adjusted individually according to clinical response.
      Steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and its 9-hydroxymetabolite
      were measured after 4 and 6 weeks using a specific HPLC assay. Psychopathological
      state was assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, and 6 by means of the positive 
      and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), and patients were considered responders if
      they showed a greater than 20% reduction in total PANSS score at final evaluation
      compared with baseline. RESULTS: Mean plasma concentrations of risperidone,
      9-OH-risperidone, and active moiety (sum of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone
      concentrations) did not differ between responders (n = 28) and non-responders (n 
      = 14). No correlation between plasma levels and percent decrease in total PANSS
      score was found for risperidone (rs = -0.187, NS), 9-OH-risperidone (rs = 0.246, 
      NS), and active moiety (rs = 0.249, NS). Active moiety concentrations in plasma
      were higher (P < 0.001) in patients developing clinically significant
      parkinsonian symptoms (n = 7) than in those with minimal (n = 7) or no
      drug-induced parkinsonism (n = 28). CONCLUSIONS: In chronic schizophrenic
      patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of the disorder, plasma levels of
      risperidone and its active metabolite correlate with the occurrence of
      parkinsonian side effects, whereas no significant correlation appears to exist
      with the degree of clinical improvement.

TI  - Acute tryptophan depletion in schizophrenia.
PG  - 75-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) function is implicated in the
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the action of new generation antipsychotic
      drugs. By the method of acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) 5-HT can be selectively 
      manipulated. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of ATD on symptoms,
      mood and cognition in schizophrenic patients. METHODS: Twenty-eight schizophrenic
      patients participated in a within subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      counterbalanced cross-over study. Patients with a concurrent DSM-IV axis I
      diagnosis were excluded. Symptoms, mood and cognitive function were evaluated
      following ATD or ingestion of a control drink. RESULTS: The depleting drink
      significantly reduced plasma total and free tryptophan. Tryptophan/LNAA ratios
      did not alter with the administration of the control drink, but differed
      significantly with ATD; however there was no significant change in tyrosine/LNAA 
      ratio. ATD led to impairment in executive function that was dependent upon the
      order of administration. Tests of sustained attention, speed of processing, and
      everyday memory were not affected. No effects were observed on subjective mood
      ratings, movement disorders or PANSS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Acute tryptophan
      depletion selectively alters cognition in schizophrenia, but has no effect on
      symptoms, mood ratings or movement disorders.

TI  - The effects of concomitant phenytoin administration on the steady-state
      pharmacokinetics of quetiapine.
PG  - 89-93
AB  - Quetiapine fumarate ('Seroquel') is a newly introduced atypical antipsychotic
      with demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of 
      schizophrenia. It is extensively metabolized, predominantly by cytochrome P450
      3A4. Therefore, concurrent administration of drugs that induce or inhibit this
      enzyme may affect quetiapine pharmacokinetics. This study demonstrated that the
      potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer phenytoin did indeed have a marked effect
      on the metabolism of quetiapine, resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when
      administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. These results indicate that dosage
      adjustment of quetiapine may be necessary when the two drugs are given
      concurrently and that caution may be required when administering other drugs that
      inhibit or induce cytochromes, particularly P450 3A4.

TI  - Effects of newer atypical antipsychotics on autonomic neurocardiac function: a
      comparison between amisulpride, olanzapine, sertindole, and clozapine.
PG  - 8-13
AB  - As part of a prospective clinical study investigating the effects of atypical
      neuroleptics on autonomic neurocardiac function (ANF), serial standardized
      recordings of conventional electrocardiograms and computer-calculated
      measurements of 5-minute resting heart rate variability (HRV) were obtained from 
      51 medication-free inpatients with schizophrenia (DSM-III-R-diagnosed) before and
      after an average of 14.1 days of treatment with amisulpride 400 mg/day (N = 12), 
      olanzapine 20 mg/day (N = 13), sertindole 12 mg/day (N = 13), or clozapine 100
      mg/day (N = 13). Reference values for the HRV data were obtained from a large
      group of well-matched healthy controls (N = 70). The most important findings were
      the following: (1) clozapine, olanzapine, and sertindole all prolonged mean
      frequency-corrected QTc times, which, in the case of sertindole, proved to be
      significant (Wilcoxon test p <0.05); (2) sertindole and clozapine significantly
      increased the mean resting heart rate; and (3) only clozapine significantly
      reduced the parasympathetic resting tone. The results of the HRV studies are
      discussed considering the in vitro receptor profiles of the atypical neuroleptics
      under study. Potential implications for the cardiac safety and tolerance of these
      drugs are also discussed.

TI  - Ziprasidone in the short-term treatment of patients with schizoaffective
      disorder: results from two double- blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter
      studies.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - This study assessed the efficacy of ziprasidone for the treatment of
      schizoaffective disorder. Data were taken from subsets of patients with
      schizoaffective disorder, derived from two separate double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter studies. A total of 115
      hospitalized patients with an acute episode of schizoaffective disorder were
      randomly assigned to receive either fixed oral doses of ziprasidone 40 mg/day (N 
      = 16), 80 mg/day (N = 18), 120 mg/day (N = 22), 160 mg/day (N = 25), or placebo
      (N = 34) for 4 to 6 weeks. Mean baseline-to-endpoint changes in Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale (BPRS) total, BPRS Core, Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale 
      (CGI-S), BPRS Depressive, BPRS Manic, and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale total scores were compared between the placebo and ziprasidone groups.
      Neurological (Simpson-Angus, Barnes Akathisia, Abnormal Involuntary Movement
      Scale [AIMS]) and other side effects were also assessed. Significant dose-related
      improvements on all primary efficacy variables (BPRS total, BPRS Core, CGI-S) and
      for BPRS Manic items were observed with ziprasidone treatment in a combined
      analysis of data from both studies (p < or = 0.01). Ziprasidone 160 mg/day was
      significantly more effective than placebo in improving mean BPRS total, BPRS
      Core, BPRS Manic, and CGI-S scores (p < 0.05). At 120 mg/day, ziprasidone was
      significantly more effective than placebo in improving mean CGI-S scores (p <
      0.05). The incidence of individual adverse events was generally low in all
      treatment groups and was not dose-related. In addition, no significant
      differences were observed between baseline-to-endpoint mean changes in
      Simpson-Angus and AIMS scores with placebo or ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day. These
      results suggest that ziprasidone may have efficacy in the treatment of affective 
      as well as psychotic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder, with a low side-effect
      burden.

TI  - Olanzapine plasma concentrations and clinical response: acute phase results of
      the North American Olanzapine Trial.
PG  - 14-20
AB  - Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is effective in the treatment of
      schizophrenia. Olanzapine plasma concentrations > or = 9.3 ng/mL (24 hours
      postdose) have been identified as a predictor of clinical response in acutely ill
      patients with schizophrenia. The authors report a receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of 12-hour olanzapine concentrations and
      treatment response from the North American Double-Blind Olanzapine Trial. After a
      4- to 7-day placebo lead-in, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for
      schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, haloperidol, or
      placebo. Patients who were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine were given
      daily doses ranging from 2.5 to 17.5 mg/day for up to 6 weeks. Blood samples for 
      the determination of olanzapine plasma concentrations were obtained between 10
      and 16 hours (11.7 +/- 1.7 hours) after the last dose was administered.
      Therapeutic response data and olanzapine concentrations used for analysis were
      obtained from the endpoint visit for each patient if the patient had been
      receiving a fixed olanzapine dose for at least the last 2 weeks of the study.
      Plasma concentrations from previous visits were used if endpoint concentrations
      were invalid. Response was defined as a > or = 20% reduction in Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale (BPRS) scores and a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity scale 
      score of < or = 3 or a final BPRS score of < or = 35. The final ROC analysis
      included data from 84 patients and suggested an olanzapine concentration > or =
      23.2 ng/mL to be a predictor of therapeutic response. Fifty-two percent of
      patients with 12-hour olanzapine concentrations > or = 23.2 ng/mL responded,
      whereas only 25% of patients with concentrations < 23.2 ng/mL responded.
      Furthermore, an olanzapine concentration > or = 23.2 ng/mL was a predictor of
      response in the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (> or = 20%
      decrease and endpoint CGI < or = 3). Olanzapine concentrations were found to be a
      function of olanzapine dose (in milligrams per day) and gender such that
      prospective olanzapine dosing is feasible. A 12-hour olanzapine plasma
      concentration of > 23.2 ng/mL was a predictor of therapeutic response in acutely 
      ill patients with schizophrenia. Males required a higher olanzapine dose to reach
      this threshold concentration than their female counterparts.

TI  - Does risperidone have a place in the treatment of nonschizophrenic patients?
PG  - 1-19
AB  - There is a now a substantial body of evidence that suggests the new antipsychotic
      agent, risperidone, may be safe and effective for treating psychotic, affective
      or behavioural symptoms associated with various disorders other than
      schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder or schizo-affective disorder. These
      conditions include bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's
      syndrome, dementia, Lewy body disease, mental retardation, Parkinson's disease,
      idiopathic segmental dystonia and organic catatonia. Although much of the data is
      anecdotal or in the form of open studies, there is now emerging a small number of
      well controlled investigations supporting efficacy for mania, dementia,
      behavioural disturbance in mental retardation and conduct disorder. Conventional 
      antipsychotics have long been used, either in a primary capacity or as an adjunct
      to treat these disorders; however, they have limited benefit, pose significant
      risks of extrapyramidal side-effects, and may cause the potentially
      life-threatening neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In contrast, risperidone at the 
      recommended low doses may be efficacious and pose reduced risk of motor
      side-effects. This article reviews the evidence that risperidone may be an
      effective new treatment for disorders other than schizophrenia.

      drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia (TD) are significantly greater
      in the older patient than in the younger patient whereas akathisia seems to occur
      evenly across the age spectrum and dystonia is uncommon among older patients. The
      literature on risk factors associated with treatment-emergent movement disorders 
      is highly variable. Treatment practices vary across the age range and the
      interaction between age and antipsychotic dosage confounds our understanding of
      the relative importance of treatment-related risk factors. However, there is
      general agreement that pre-existing extrapyramidal signs (EPS) increase the
      vulnerability of the patient to developing significant drug-induced movement
      disorders. Elderly patients with dementia are at greater risk than patients
      without dementia for persistent drug-induced EPS. Management of drug-induced
      movement disorders in the older patient requires careful consideration of the
      contraindications imposed by such agents as anticholinergics and beta-blockers.
      At present, well-controlled double-blind studies of second-generation
      antipsychotics such as clozapine, risperidone. olanzapine or quetiapine for
      reducing the risk of treatment-emergent movement disorders in the elderly have
      not been published. However, open-label studies of atypical antipsychotics
      demonstrate a markedly lower incidence of both EPS and TD compared with
      conventional antipsychotic treatment in the elderly. There is emerging literature
      in support of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of existing drug-induced 
      movement disorders. More controversial is the use of adjunctive antioxidants in
      newly treated patients who are vulnerable to drug-induced movement disorders.
      While the evidence is mixed in support of antioxidants for the treatment of TD,
      the possibility remains that prophylactic use of antioxidants may help reduce the
      incidence of TD. The development of a drug-induced movement disorder often
      reduces the quality of life in an elderly patient. Effective pharmacological
      management requires cooperation from the patient and family, which can be
      fostered early in the patient's care through proper informed consent. The risks
      and benefits of antipsychotic treatment in the elderly patient need to be
      communicated to the patient and family. At the present time, there is no
      consistently effective treatment for patients with TD once it develops.
      Therefore, attention should focus on its prevention and close monitoring.

TI  - Decreased anterior cingulate myo-inositol/creatine spectroscopy resonance with
      lithium treatment in children with bipolar disorder.
PG  - 359-69
AB  - This project was designed to compare differences in brain proton spectra between 
      children and adolescents with bipolar disorder (BPD) and gender and age-matched
      normal controls, and to measure changes in myo-inositol levels following lithium 
      therapy, utilizing in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). A
      single voxel (2x2x2 cm3) was placed in brain anterior cingulate cortex for
      acquisition of the 1H spectra at baseline and after acute (7 days) lithium
      administration in 11 children (mean age 11.4 years) diagnosed with BPD, and in 11
      normal controls. Acute lithium treatment was associated with a significant
      reduction in the myo-inositol/creatine ratio. This decrement was also significant
      in lithium-responders when analyzed separate from non-responders. Compared to
      normal controls, BPD subjects showed a trend towards a higher
      myo-inositol/creatine during the manic phase. These preliminary data provide
      evidence that a significant reduction in anterior cingulate myo-inositol magnetic
      resonance may occur after lithium treatment, especially among responders.
      Follow-up studies involving a larger sample may allow us to confirm whether
      changes in myo-inositol associated with acute lithium therapy persist in
      long-term clinical response of patients with and without lithium compliance.

      schizophrenia: relationship between interview-based ratings and inpatient ward
      observations.
PG  - 443-7
AB  - The concurrent validity of interview-based ratings of negative symptoms in 35
      inpatients with chronic, treatment refractory schizophrenia was evaluated.
      Correlations were examined between interview-based ratings of negative symptoms, 
      measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale, and the naturalistic behavior of inpatients as assessed by the
      Time Sample Behavior Checklist. Higher levels of interview-based negative
      symptoms were related to reduced interpersonal activity on the inpatient ward,
      but not to entertainment, instrumental or self-maintenance activities. These
      findings offer partial support for the concurrent validity of office-based
      ratings of negative symptoms, and highlight the importance of longitudinal
      observations of patients for accurate identification of negative symptoms.

TI  - Consistency of atypical antipsychotic superiority to placebo in recent clinical
      trials.
PG  - 64-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of control placebos in clinical trials of new antipsychotic
      medications is increasingly under examination. The active controlled equivalence 
      study could offer a potential alternative design. First, however, it must be
      clear that any proposed standard control agent has been consistently superior to 
      placebo in previous studies. METHODS: Through a Freedom of Information Act
      request, we identified nine placebo-controlled trials of risperidone, olanzapine,
      or quetiapine. RESULTS: Meta-analysis indicated that the pooled estimate of the
      true population effect size +/- SE was 0.46 +/- 0.06 for categorical response
      rates and >0.53 +/- 0.07 for the continuous Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale change
      score outcome measure. If the desired detectable effect size is set very
      conservatively at a 95% confidence lower bound for the estimate of true effect
      size, statistical power for random samples of 80 per group drawn from a
      population of subjects similar to that of the nine meta-analyzed studies is.67
      for categorical response rates and >.82 for the continuous measure, based on
      one-sided alpha =.05. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest substantial confidence that
      a therapeutic dose of an atypical antipsychotic will be statistically superior to
      placebo in an adequately sized randomized trial, when reporting a continuous
      measure as the principal outcome.

TI  - Clozapine-associated reduction in arrest rates of psychotic patients with
      criminal histories.
PG  - 270-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the relationship between treatment with clozapine
      and rates of arrest of psychotic outpatients with criminal histories. METHOD:
      Patients who had been given a DSM-IV psychotic diagnosis were selected from an
      urban outpatient clinic database. Background checks performed on 360 patients
      identified 165 (45.8%) with positive criminal histories in Massachusetts. The
      authors reviewed the charts of these patients to determine several variables,
      including whether and when they had received clozapine. A Poisson regression
      model was used to regress arrest rates against the variables of age, sex, onset
      of illness, birth cohort, and clozapine treatment. Risk ratios (i.e., percent
      change in arrest rates) were then calculated by computing the exponential of the 
      Poisson regression coefficients. RESULTS: The 165 patients included in the
      analysis had a total of 1,126 arrests. The mean number of arrests was 6.8.
      Differences were found between the 65 patients who received clozapine and the 100
      patients who did not in number of arrests, sex, and onset of illness. The
      regression revealed significantly higher arrest rate estimates associated with
      more recent birth cohort (4.8%) and with onset of illness (64.6%) and lower
      arrest rate estimates associated with higher levels of education (11.6%),
      receiving clozapine (32.6%), and receiving clozapine during specific periods of
      time (68.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine's effect on arrest rates in this group of
      patients is large enough to warrant further investigation. The data indicate that
      clozapine may reduce recidivism in subjects with criminal histories who are in
      need of antipsychotic medication.

AB  - Agitated, aggressive behavior and psychosis are common manifestations of
      Alzheimer's disease that frequently lead to institutionalization. The usefulness 
      of conventional neuroleptic treatment in this population is limited by narrow
      therapeutic windows because of limited efficacy and high sensitivity to side
      effects. More recently, investigational clinical trials have suggested potential 
      utility for atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine, and

TI  - Ciprofloxacin increases serum clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine: a study in
      patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 585-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A possible pharmacokinetic interaction between a CYP1A2 inhibitor,
      ciprofloxacin, and clozapine was studied in schizophrenia patients with stable
      clozapine treatment. METHODS: A randomised double-blind cross-over study design
      with two phases was used. Seven schizophrenic inpatients volunteered to receive, 
      in addition to their previous drug regimen, either 250 mg ciprofloxacin or
      placebo twice daily (b.i.d.) for 7 days. The phases were separated by a 7-day
      wash-out period. Serum concentrations of clozapine and its main metabolite
      N-desmethylclozapine were measured during both phases before the first dose on
      day 1 and on days 3 and 8. RESULTS: Ciprofloxacin increased mean serum
      concentration of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine by 29% (P < 0.01) and 31% (P 
      < 0.05), respectively. There was a significant positive correlation (r = 0.90, P 
      < 0.01) between the individual concentrations of serum ciprofloxacin and the
      increase in concentrations of clozapine plus N-desmethylclozapine. The increase
      in serum clozapine concentrations correlated significantly (r = 0.89, P < 0.01)
      with the ratios of N-desmethylclozapine to clozapine concentrations. CONCLUSION: 
      Even a low dose of ciprofloxacin can moderately increase serum concentrations of 
      clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine. A probable mechanism of interaction is an
      inhibition of CYP1A2 enzyme by ciprofloxacin. The possibility of clinically
      significant interaction should be considered, especially when higher doses of
      ciprofloxacin are used concomitantly with clozapine.

TI  - Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis and hereditary polymorphisms of clozapine
      metabolizing enzymes: no association with myeloperoxidase and cytochrome P4502D6.
PG  - 218-20
AB  - The pathomechanisms of most drug-induced agranulocytoses are unclear; however,
      there are some studies pointing to genetic determinants. Some drug-induced
      agranulocytoses such as clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CA) may be regarded as
      an idiosyncratic drug reaction because of its preclinical and clinical
      characteristics. To study some aspects of the genetic background of CA further,
      polymorphisms of specific metabolizing enzyme systems of clozapine were examined.
      Thirty-one schizophrenic patients with CA and 77 schizophrenic comparison
      subjects without this adverse effect underwent genotyping of a recently
      discovered G(-463)A polymorphism of myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene and cytochrome
      P4502D6. Neither the MPO mutation nor specific genotypes of cytochrome P4502D6
      were associated with CA. Both were equally distributed among CA patients and
      controls. Thus, our data suggest lack of evidence of an association of CA and
      genetically variable activity of these specific drug metabolizing enzymes;
      however, this may be due to statistical reasons only. Thus, further studies with 
      greater CA samples are necessary to draw final conclusions about these
      genetically based hypotheses.

TI  - Impact of risperidone on seclusion and restraint at a state psychiatric hospital.
PG  - 827-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of risperidone on seclusion and restraint in
      patients at a state psychiatric facility, shortly after risperidone's release.
      METHODS: Patients who were in the hospital for at least 3 months prior to
      receiving risperidone and subsequently received risperidone for at least 3 months
      formed the cohort. A mirror-image design was used with duration to a maximum of 1
      year before and 1 year after initiation of risperidone. The hospital population
      that did not receive either risperidone or clozapine during the same time period 
      was used for comparison of trends of seclusion and restraint. RESULTS:
      Seventy-four patients (most with schizophrenia) met the inclusion criteria of the
      risperidone group. There were statistically significant decreases in the number
      of seclusion hours (2.2 [SD 5.5] to 0.26 [SD 0.06]) and of events (0.23 [SD 0.59]
      to 0.05 [SD 0.14]) per person per month during risperidone treatment, compared
      with the prerisperidone treatment period (P = 0.01). The comparison group also
      evidenced decreases on these measures during the same time period, but the
      risperidone-treated cohort achieved a proportionally greater reduction. There
      were similar trends toward reduction in the restraint measures during risperidone
      treatment compared with prerisperidone, but these did not achieve statistical
      significance. The comparison group also showed slightly decreased use of
      restraints over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone appears to have had a 
      positive impact on seclusion in this state-hospital psychiatric population. These
      data support the positive impact of risperidone on violence found in other
      studies. Violence and aggression are major factors that affect morale among
      psychiatric patients and staff. So, any benefit in this regard as a result of
      antipsychotic drug treatment is salutary for patients, families, and health care 
      providers.

TI  - A novel augmentation strategy for treating resistant major depression.
PG  - 131-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment-resistant depression is a significant public health concern;
      drug switching or augmentation often produce limited results. The authors
      hypothesized that fluoxetine could be augmented with olanzapine to successfully
      treat resistant depression. METHOD: An 8-week double-blind study was conducted
      with 28 patients who were diagnosed with recurrent, nonbipolar,
      treatment-resistant depression without psychotic features. Subjects were randomly
      assigned to one of three groups: olanzapine plus placebo, fluoxetine plus
      placebo, or olanzapine plus fluoxetine. RESULTS: Fluoxetine monotherapy produced 
      minimal improvement on various scales that rate severity of depression. The
      benefits of olanzapine monotherapy were modest. Olanzapine plus fluoxetine
      produced significantly greater improvement than either monotherapy on one measure
      and significantly greater improvement than olanzapine monotherapy on the other
      measures after 1 week. There were no significant differences between treatment
      groups on extrapyramidal measures nor significant adverse drug interactions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine plus fluoxetine demonstrated superior efficacy for
      treating resistant depression compared to either agent alone.

TI  - Practice-related improvement in information processing with novel antipsychotic
      treatment.
PG  - 139-48
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attentional deficits are prominent in schizophrenia, and skill
      learning is impaired. Novel antipsychotic treatment has been reported to improve 
      certain cognitive skills in schizophrenic patients, but no information is yet
      available about the effect of newer medications on skill learning. METHODS:
      Clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (n=16) and chronically hospitalized
      inpatients (n=8) were recruited while receiving conventional antipsychotic
      treatment. Subjects were tested at baseline on a visual continuous performance
      test (CPT), performed alone and simultaneously with an auditory CPT. Normal
      controls (n=8) were also tested at baseline. The inpatients and half of the
      outpatients were switched to treatment with risperidone. All patients then
      performed the visual CPT on a daily basis and performed the dual tasks once per
      week, for 4weeks. RESULTS: Patients who remained on conventional medications did 
      not improve in their performance despite the extensive practice on the test. Both
      chronic and stable patients receiving risperidone treatment manifested a
      statistically significant (P<0.05) improvement from baseline on both single and
      dual-task visual CPT. Stable outpatients performed significantly better at the
      end of the protocol than the normal controls performance at baseline (P<0.05).
      IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that practice-related improvements in the
      performance of information processing tests are enhanced by novel antipsychotic
      medications. Although the specific biological mechanism of this effect is not yet
      known, the results may suggest that use of newer medications will enhance skill
      development and perhaps facilitate rehabilitation of patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Improvement in cognition associated with novel antipsychotic drugs: a direct drug
      effect or reduction of EPS?
PG  - 81-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Administration of novel, versus classic, antipsychotic agents to
      patients suffering from psychosis is associated both with moderately better
      scores on cognitive tests, and with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Because 
      improved motor functioning may enable better performance on some components of
      cognitive test batteries, and because the advantages of the novel antipsychotics 
      on cognitive performance are not very large, it is sometimes difficult to discern
      if improvement in a given cognitive task is due to a direct effect of the novel
      antipsychotic drug, or is secondary to the novel drug's decreased propensity to
      induce EPS. In an attempt to distinguish between these two possibilities, the
      present study examined the ability of patients suffering from schizophrenia
      receiving classic, versus novel antipsychotics, to perform a computerized
      visuo-motor test (VMT). VMT assesses planning capabilities, attention and
      executive functions known to be impaired in schizophrenia, which are suggested to
      be affected by novel antipsychotics. METHODS: Seventy-six patients suffering from
      schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder, receiving haloperidol (23 patients,
      mean dose 10.01+/-6.1mg/day), olanzapine (26 patients, mean dose 10.56 +/- 4.9
      mg/day) or risperidone (27 patients, mean dose 4.35 +/- 1.7 mg/day) were assessed
      for EPS using the parkinsonian subscale of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating
      Subscale (ESRS), and with the VMT. RESULTS: Cognitive functioning as measured by 
      the VMT was better for patients receiving risperidone or olanzapine, compared
      with those receiving haloperidol (F=6.636, df=2,67, P=0. 002), while the patients
      receiving haloperidol or risperidone suffered from more severe EPS compared with 
      the patients receiving olanzapine (F=3.996, df=2,71, P=0.023). DISCUSSION:
      Although the patients receiving risperidone suffered from EPS similar in severity
      to the EPS of the patients receiving haloperidol, their performance on a task
      involving visuo-motor and attentional skills was similar to that of the patients 
      receiving olanzapine. This finding implies that there is a dissociation between
      the antipsychotic drug's ability to affect cognitive functioning, and EPS. This
      dissociation indirectly suggests that the advantages offered by novel
      antipsychotics on cognitive performance are a direct effect, rather than being
      entirely mediated by improved movement abilities.

TI  - Effects of risperidone on affective symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 343-9
AB  - The effects of risperidone on affective symptoms were determined by an analysis
      of pooled data from six double-blind trials of risperidone versus haloperidol in 
      1254 patients with chronic schizophrenia. Symptoms indicating mania were assessed
      by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) excitement and grandiosity
      items and by the excited cluster (excitement, hostility, uncooperativeness, and
      poor impulse control); anxious / depressive symptoms were assessed by the PANSS
      anxious / depressive cluster (somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, and
      depression). Mean change scores from baseline to endpoint were compared in
      patients receiving risperidone, haloperidol or placebo by analysis of variance
      with factors for trial and baseline score included in the model. In all patients,
      change scores on excitement and grandiosity items and excited and anxious /
      depressive clusters were significantly greater for risperidone than for
      haloperidol or placebo. Dropouts due to inefficacy were less frequent with
      risperidone (5 of 59; 8%) than with haloperidol (7 of 38; 18%) or placebo (8 of
      10; 80%). In patients with anxious / depressive symptoms at baseline (anxiety /
      depression cluster score > or = the median), anxiety / depression scores
      decreased significantly more with risperidone than with haloperidol, and symptom 
      reduction occurred faster with risperidone. These results are consistent with
      previous reports and suggest that risperidone is more efficacious than
      haloperidol for affective symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - The effect of clozapine on caudate nucleus volume in schizophrenic patients
      previously treated with typical antipsychotics.
PG  - 47-54
AB  - Typical antipsychotics have been reported to enlarge the caudate nucleus in
      schizophrenic patients. The atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, is associated with
      a decrease in caudate size in patients previously treated with typical
      antipsychotics. The present study investigates whether a change in caudate volume
      after switching from treatment with typical antipsychotics to treatment with
      clozapine is related to improvement in symptoms or tardive dyskinesia (TD).
      Twenty-six schizophrenic patients participated in this open study. Caudate
      nucleus volume and TD were assessed before discontinuing typical antipsychotics
      and after 24 weeks of treatment with clozapine. After discontinuing typical
      antipsychotics, symptoms were assessed in a 3 days drug-free period and
      subsequently once a month. Treatment with clozapine resulted in a decrease in
      caudate volume, improvement in symptoms and amelioration of TD. However, no
      difference in caudate volume changes was found between responders and
      non-responders to clozapine and no correlations were found between caudate volume
      changes and reduction of TD. In conclusion, this study replicates earlier
      findings that clozapine decreases caudate volume in patients previously treated
      with typical antipsychotics and suggests that this effect is unrelated to
      treatment response or to amelioration of TD.

TI  - Hematologic reference ranges in a population of patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 653-7
AB  - The potential hematotoxic effects of antipsychotic drugs are well known and may
      limit the use of some effective therapies. Although some previous studies have
      suggested that patients with schizophrenia may have altered "normal" values, only
      limited data were available. It is now believed that biological values do not
      usually follow a normal distribution; therefore, reference ranges are frequently 
      used when interpreting laboratory tests in clinical practice and in research.
      However, it may be important to use disease-specific hematologic reference ranges
      when evaluating laboratory test results for patients with schizophrenia. In this 
      study, data taken from patients with schizophrenia prior to treatment in previous
      phase II and phase III pharmaceutical studies were analyzed to produce reference 
      ranges for a variety of hematologic parameters. An increased variability was
      shown in the reference ranges for all white blood cell indices between patients
      with schizophrenia and the population without schizophrenia. Certain reference
      values also showed heterogeneity for gender, age, and racial descent. This study 
      suggests that abnormal hematologic findings in patients with schizophrenia should
      be assessed in the context of a valid reference range. This information will be
      of value to psychiatrists, laboratory scientists, and other physicians who
      encounter hematologic problems in patients with schizophrenia, as well as in the 
      assessment of the adverse effects of new therapeutic agents.

TI  - Strategies for switching from conventional antipsychotic drugs or risperidone to 
      olanzapine.
PG  - 833-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy and safety of 4 therapeutically
      relevant strategies for switching clinically stable patients from a conventional 
      antipsychotic drug or risperidone to olanzapine. METHOD: Two hundred nine
      outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder
      who were clinically stable while being treated with a conventional antipsychotic 
      drug or risperidone were openly randomly assigned to either abrupt or gradual
      discontinuation of their prior antipsychotic drug. Patients were further randomly
      assigned in a double-blind fashion to immediate olanzapine initiation
      (olanzapine, 10 mg q.d. for 3 weeks) or stepwise initiation (a sequence of 1 week
      each on placebo; olanzapine, 5 mg q.d.; and olanzapine, 10 mg q.d.). The efficacy
      of these 4 switching paradigms was assessed using the Clinical Global Impressions
      (CGI)-Improvement scale, Patient's Global Impressions (PGI)-Improvement scale,
      and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Safety assessments included
      ratings for extrapyramidal symptoms, cognitive impairment, adverse events,
      laboratory parameters, weight change, and vital signs. RESULTS: The paradigm of
      gradual antipsychotic drug discontinuation combined with an initial full dose of 
      olanzapine, 10 mg/day, had the most favorable efficacy and tolerability profile
      overall. By week 3, the majority of completing patients on all 4 switching
      paradigms were either improved or clinically unchanged (> 90%). No clinically
      significant differences between switching paradigms were seen in laboratory
      values or vital signs. CONCLUSION: In this study, switching clinically stable
      outpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to
      olanzapine was most successful when a full therapeutic dose of olanzapine was
      immediately initiated while gradually discontinuing prior conventional
      antipsychotic drug or risperidone treatment. Overall, switching was achieved
      without increased vulnerability to relapse or to occurrence of clinically
      burdensome antipsychotic drug withdrawal symptoms in the majority of patients.

TI  - Risperidone in the treatment of dopamine-induced psychosis in Parkinson's
      disease: an open pilot trial.
PG  - 1230-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of risperidone in patients with
      Parkinson's disease (PD) who are experiencing significant dopamine-induced
      psychosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients (median age, 72 yrs)
      participated in this 12-week, open pilot study receiving 0.5 to 3 mg oral
      risperidone per day. Maintenance antiparkinsonian medication was continued
      throughout, although psychotropic medication was discontinued. EFFICACY RESULTS: 
      Risperidone produced a substantial improvement in psychotic symptoms, shown on
      the mean total positive subscale score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale (PANSS) by a 30% improvement (-3.1 decrease) after 1 week and a 66%
      improvement (-6.8 decrease) at end point. This improvement was most evident in
      the items delusions, hallucinatory behavior, and suspiciousness/persecution.
      Risperidone also achieved significant improvement from baseline in Clinical
      Global Impression (CGI)-severity and CGI-improvement (p < 0.001, Page test).
      Risperidone treatment did not adversely affect symptoms specific to Parkinson's
      disease, as assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).
      SAFETY RESULTS: Sixteen patients reported at least one adverse event, but only
      two patients withdrew as a result of adverse events. No significant changes or
      clinically relevant abnormalities were observed in laboratory parameters or vital
      signs. CONCLUSION: Short-term use of risperidone (mean dosage, 1.1 mg per day)
      improves the psychopathology of patients with PD who have dopamine-induced
      psychosis without adversely affecting the symptoms of PD. Higher doses and
      long-term use were not addressed in this study and may be precluded by
      extrapyramidal side effects.

TI  - Augmentation with sulpiride for a schizophrenic patient partially responsive to
      clozapine.
PG  - 390-3; discussion 393-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenic patients who are only partially responsive to clozapine 
      pose a therapeutic challenge. In these circumstances some clinicians would
      consider adding in a second antipsychotic. We present a case report and review
      evidence for the efficacy of such augmentation strategies. METHOD: Single case
      report and literature review. RESULTS: The total number of patients in studies
      and case reports of combining clozapine with other antipsychotics is small. There
      has been only one randomized controlled trial. This found the addition of
      sulpiride to clozapine resulted in clinical improvement in some patients.
      CONCLUSION: Further randomized controlled studies of augmentation of clozapine
      therapy are needed to provide scientific justification for this clinical
      practice.

TI  - Association study of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 with clinical phenotype and
      clozapine response in schizophrenia.
PG  - 172-4
AB  - Schizophrenic patients with the apolipoprotein E (APOE = gene; apoE = protein)
      epsilon4 allele exhibited lower psychosis scores than patients without the
      epsilon4 allele in previous reports. The present study tested the hypothesis that
      the APOE epsilon4 allele confers association with the clinical manifestations of 
      schizophrenia or clozapine response. A total of 95 schizophrenic patients who
      were treatment resistant were included in the study. The results demonstrated
      that the presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele did not influence the response to
      clozapine in schizophrenic patients, neither was the baseline psychopathology
      related to the APOE epsilon4 allele. Given the multiple functions of the apoE
      protein in the brain, further study of the influence of APOE on CNS medication
      response is needed.

TI  - An assessment of iloperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 2935-43
AB  - Iloperidone (Novartis' Zomariltrade mark) is an atypical antipsychotic agent for 
      the treatment of schizophrenia. Current trends in the treatment of schizophrenia 
      indicate that some atypical antipsychotics are being recommended as first-line
      therapy. Atypical antipsychotics, in addition to being dopamine (D) receptor
      antagonists, are all relatively potent serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists and 
      are less likely than conventional dopamine antagonists to induce movement
      disorders. However, all of these agents differ in their receptor profiles and
      clinical profiles. Iloperidone, a benzisoxazole, is a mixed
      5-HT(2A)/D(2)antagonist. Iloperidone was found to be more potent than its
      analogues when compared with haloperidol in antagonising climbing behaviour in
      mice. Iloperidone is extensively metabolised and the main circulating metabolite 
      is reduced iloperidone. In patients treated with iloperidone, a low incidence of 
      extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain has been shown. Data from Phase II trials
      demonstrated efficacy in patients at doses of 8 mg/day and tolerability was good 
      up to 32 mg/day. Phase III prospective, double-blind, randomised trials with
      iloperidone are in progress under the ZEUS (Zomariltrade mark Efficacy Utility
      and Safety) programme involving 3300 patients. Iloperidone, with a balance of
      activity at the dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors, has obvious advantages
      over clozapine and olanzapine, both of which have a similar receptor profile as
      they favour serotonergic over dopamine receptors. Iloperidone is likely to reach 
      the market in 2001 and has favourable prospects in the atypical antipsychotic
      market for schizophrenia, which is expanding from US$ 1.5 billion in 2000 to US$ 
      3 billion in 2005.

TI  - Differential efficacy of lithium and carbamazepine in the prophylaxis of bipolar 
      disorder: results of the MAP study.
PG  - 2-10
AB  - In a randomized clinical trial with an observation period of 2.5 years, the
      differential efficacy of lithium versus carbamazepine was compared in 171 bipolar
      patients (DSM-IV). In order to investigate the efficacy of the two drugs in
      clearly defined subsamples, a series of subgroup analyses was carried out. First,
      patients with a bipolar I disorder (n = 114) were analyzed separately. In these
      patients, lithium was superior to carbamazepine. In contrast, carbamazepine was
      at least equally as efficacious as lithium in the subsample of patients with
      bipolar II disorder or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (n = 57). In a
      second analysis on differential efficacy, the whole sample was subdivided into a 
      classical subgroup (bipolar I patients without mood-incongruent delusions and
      without comorbidity; n = 67) and a nonclassical subgroup including all other
      patients (n = 104). Classical bipolar patients had a significantly lower
      hospitalization rate under lithium than under carbamazepine prophylaxis (26 vs.
      62%, p = 0.012). For the nonclassical group, a tendency in favor of carbamazepine
      was found. In a third step, we analyzed the impact of episode sequence on
      differential efficacy. In a global view, the episode sequence prior to the index 
      episode was not correlated to differential efficacy. Our results might, however, 
      indicate that patients with an episode sequence of mania-depression-free interval
      responded better to lithium. Besides differential efficacy, suicidal behavior and
      patients' satisfaction with treatment were investigated. Regarding suicidal
      behavior, a trend in favor of lithium was found. The data on patients'
      satisfaction were significantly in favor of carbamazepine. In conclusion, lithium
      appears to be superior to carbamazepine in classical bipolar cases and might have
      additional impact on proneness to suicide. The distinctly larger group of
      patients with nonclassical features might profit more from carbamazepine which
      seems to be well accepted by the patients. Hence, treatment alternatives to
      lithium are desirable for the majority of bipolar patients.

TI  - Antipsychotic drug use and risk of first-time idiopathic venous thromboembolism: 
      a case-control study.
PG  - 1219-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic drugs have been associated with an increased risk of
      adverse events such as venous thromboembolism. Our aim was to assess this risk in
      users of conventional antipsychotic drugs who had been diagnosed with first-time,
      idiopathic venous thromboembolism. METHODS: From a baseline population of 29,952 
      recipients of conventional and atypical antipsychotic drugs aged younger than 60 
      years, we identified 42 individuals with idiopathic venous thromboembolism and
      172 matched controls. We compared risk of current and recent use of antipsychotic
      drugs with non-use before the index date in cases and controls. FINDINGS: Current
      exposure to conventional antipsychotic drugs was associated with a significantly 
      increased risk of idiopathic venous thromboembolism compared with non-use
      (adjusted odds ratio 7.1 [95% CI 2.3-21.97]). Although we found no difference
      between phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, or other conventional antipsychotic drugs,
      low potency antipsychotic drugs drugs such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine
      were more strongly associated with venous thromboembolism (odds ratio 24.1
      [3.3-172.7]) than were high potency antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol (3.3 
      [0.8-13.2]). The risk for venous thrombosis was highest during the first few
      months of conventional antipsychotic drug use. INTERPRETATION: Current exposure
      to conventional antipsychotic drugs significantly increases the risk of
      idiopathic venous thromboembolism in men and women younger than 60 years of age.

TI  - Immediate effects of risperidone on cortico-striato-thalamic loops and the
      hippocampus.
PG  - 402-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional imaging studies indicate that delusions and hallucinations
      in schizophrenia are associated with overactivity of the left hippocampus and
      ventral striatum. Hippocampal neuronal firing modulates feedback to cortex via
      cortico-striato-thalamic loops. AIMS: To test the hypothesis that recovery from
      psychosis is associated with decrease in activity in cortico-striato-thalamic
      circuits, and, furthermore, that reduction in hippocampal activity predicts the
      degree of alleviation of delusions and hallucinations. METHOD: Positron emission 
      tomography (PET) was used to measure the effects of the atypical antipsychotic,
      risperidone, on glucose metabolism in eight first-episode schizophrenia patients.
      RESULTS: A single dose of risperidone produced decreases in metabolism in ventral
      striatum, thalamus and frontal cortex. The magnitude of decreases in left
      hippocampus predicted subsequent reduction in delusions and hallucinations. After
      six weeks' treatment with risperidone, the decreases in frontal metabolism were
      more extensive. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of antipsychotic action of risperidone
      entails reduction of hippocampal activity together with reduced feedback via
      cortico-striato-thalamic loops.

TI  - Nicotine transdermal patch and atypical antipsychotic medications for smoking
      cessation in schizophrenia.
PG  - 1835-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenic patients have high rates of cigarette smoking. The
      authors compared the outcomes of two group psychotherapy programs for smoking
      cessation in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were
      also treated with the nicotine transdermal patch and with either atypical or
      typical antipsychotic medications. METHOD: Forty-five subjects were randomly
      assigned to 1) the group therapy program of the American Lung Association (N=17) 
      or 2) a specialized group therapy program for smokers with schizophrenia (N=28)
      that emphasized motivational enhancement, relapse prevention, social skills
      training, and psychoeducation. All subjects participated in 10 weeks of treatment
      with the nicotine transdermal patch (21 mg/day) and 10 weekly group therapy
      sessions and continued to receive their prestudy atypical (N=18) or typical
      (N=27) antipsychotic medications. Outcome variables included treatment retention,
      rate of smoking abstinence, and expired-breath carbon monoxide level. RESULTS:
      Smoking abstinence rates did not differ in the two group therapy programs.
      However, atypical antipsychotic agents, in combination with the nicotine
      transdermal patch, significantly enhanced the rate of smoking cessation (55.6% in
      the atypical agent group versus 22.2% in the typical group), which was reflected 
      by a significant effect of atypical versus typical agents on carbon monoxide
      levels. Risperidone and olanzapine were associated with the highest quit rates.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that 1) smoking cessation rates with the
      nicotine transdermal patch are modest in schizophrenia, 2) specialized group
      therapy for schizophrenic patients is not significantly different from American
      Lung Association group therapy in its effect on smoking cessation, and 3)
      atypical agents may be superior to typical agents in combination with the
      nicotine transdermal patch for smoking cessation in schizophrenia.

TI  - The effects of olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol on plasma prolactin
      levels in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 1085-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is relatively little comparative information on elevations in
      plasma prolactin level (PRL) with conventional versus novel antipsychotic agents.
      OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the comparative effects on PRL of olanzapine,
      risperidone, and haloperidol based on data from 3 multicenter, double-blind,
      randomized clinical trials. Magnitude of response, dose dependency, time course, 
      effects of sex and age, and response to switching from haloperidol to olanzapine 
      are assessed. METHODS: The effects of olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol on
      PRL were assessed in patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses
      participating in 3 double-blind clinical trials: (1) a 6-week acute trial
      comparing olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 1,336) and haloperidol 5 to 20 mg/d (n =
      660), with a 1-year, open-label olanzapine extension for responders; (2) a
      54-week study comparing olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 21), risperidone 4 to 10
      mg/d (n = 21), and haloperidol 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 23) in early illness; and (3) a 
      28-week study comparing olanzapine 10 to 20 mg/d (n = 172) and risperidone 4 to
      12 mg/d (n = 167). RESULTS: PRL elevations were significantly greater with
      risperidone than with either olanzapine or haloperidol in study 2. and
      significantly greater than with olanzapine in study 3 (all, P < 0.001). PRL
      elevations were significantly greater with haloperidol than with olanzapine in
      study 1 (P < 0.001 ). A dose-response relationship was not consistently confirmed
      with any of the drug treatments. Risperidone-associated PRL elevations peaked
      relatively early in treatment. In haloperidol- and risperidone-treated patients, 
      the mean change in PRL was greater in women than in men. PRL decreased
      significantly when treatment was switched from haloperidol to olanzapine.
      CONCLUSIONS: This side-by-side analysis of 3 independent studies suggests that
      with the 3 antipsychotic drugs studied, PRL is elevated moderately by olanzapine 
      (mean change, 1-4 ng/mL), intermediately by haloperidol (mean change,
      approximately 17 ng/mL), and strongly by risperidone (mean change, 45-80 ng/mL). 
      No consistent dose-response relationship was observed, and the time course and
      sex-dependency of the response differed between the 3 agents. Patients with
      haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia may benefit from a switch to olanzapine.
      Long-term studies examining the health consequences of chronic hyperprolactinemia
      during antipsychotic treatment are needed.

TI  - The effectiveness of olanzapine in treatment-refractory schizophrenia when
      patients are nonresponsive to or unable to tolerate clozapine.
PG  - 1021-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This multicenter, open-label study was designed to assess the efficacy
      and tolerability of olanzapine in patients with chronic schizophrenia who are
      resistant to therapy with classic neuroleptic agents and are either not
      responsive to or unable to tolerate clozapine. METHODS: Patients received
      olanzapine orally once daily for 18 weeks at doses ranging from 5 to 25 mg. The
      primary efficacy measure was change in the total score on the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to end point. Secondary efficacy
      measures were the total score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); the
      PANSS positive, negative, general psychopathology, and mood subscores; and the
      Clinical Global Impression improvement score. Also recorded were spontaneously
      reported adverse events; extrapyramidal symptoms (assessed by the Abnormal
      Involuntary Movement Scale, Simpson-Angus Scale, and Barnes Akathisia Scale);
      vital signs; and clinical laboratory test results. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients 
      were treated with olanzapine; of these, 45 were assessable over the full 18-week 
      study period. Total scores on the PANSS and BPRS were reduced from baseline by an
      average of 17.7 (14.2%) and 9.8 points (20.2%), respectively. Eighteen patients
      (40.0%) experienced a treatment response, defined as a reduction in PANSS total
      score of > or = 20%. A total of 25 patients (55.6%) achieved a similar reduction 
      in BPRS total score. Significant reductions were seen in both the positive and
      negative symptom scores on the PANSS (P < 0.001). Olanzapine was well tolerated, 
      with minimal treatment-emergent adverse events or clinically relevant changes in 
      vital signs or clinical laboratory test results. No clinically significant blood 
      dyscrasias were observed in olanzapine-treated patients, including those who had 
      discontinued clozapine because of treatment-associated leukopenia or neutropenia.
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that olanzapine may be of benefit
      in patients who are refractory to or unable to tolerate clozapine.

TI  - Clinical and psychopharmacologic factors influencing family burden in refractory 
      schizophrenia. The Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on
      Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia.
PG  - 671-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the effect of clozapine and haloperidol and
      identifies other factors related to family burden as experienced by relatives of 
      patients with refractory schizophrenia (DSM-III-R). METHOD: Of 423 patients
      participating in a multisite randomized clinical trial, 221 identified a family
      member who was actively involved in their care and who agreed to complete a
      standardized measure of family burden at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after
      randomization, simultaneous with comprehensive patient assessments. RESULTS:
      Patient factors most consistently correlated with greater family burden were
      symptom severity, days living in the community (i.e., not in the hospital), and
      frequency of family contact. Among family members, clozapine was associated with 
      significantly (p = .048) greater reduction in feelings of dissatisfaction related
      to providing support to the patient, but not in objective measures of support,
      amount of worry the patient engendered, or days of missed employment or household
      activity. Although clozapine reduces symptoms, thus lowering family burden, it
      also increases days living in the community, which tends to increase family
      burden, perhaps canceling out the benefit to families of reduced symptoms.
      CONCLUSION: Clozapine has a small but significant effect on the experience of
      families of patients. This is the first study to demonstrate that effective
      pharmacotherapy may be of some benefit to families as well as to patients.

TI  - Treatment refractory schizophrenia.
PG  - 373-84
AB  - Treatment resistance constitutes a significant dilemma in schizophrenia since it 
      affects a substantial number of patients, their families and the health care
      professionals involved in their care. Nonresponsiveness needs to be approached as
      a multidimensional syndrome by specifying which symptoms in the spectrum of
      positive symptoms, negative symptoms, excitement/hostility, cognitive symptoms,
      and anxiety/depression are failing to respond to treatment. This review presents 
      some of the clinical, demographic and biological correlates of nonresponse, in
      addition to compliance issues, psychosocial factors or side effects and
      as-yet-untreated comorbidities as a source for nonresponse. The effects of the
      atypicals clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine as compared to
      typicals are reviewed using available double-blind studies in this treatment
      refractory group of schizophrenia patients. The limited number of reports on the 
      comparison of atypical compounds amongst each other are critically presented.
      Given that a subset of patients still do not respond to these agents, clinicians 
      are using various augmentation strategies. We review studies with augmentation
      strategies which remain difficult to interpret given the open label and
      uncontrolled nature of most of these studies.

TI  - Bipolar disorder therapeutics: maintenance treatment.
PG  - 573-81
AB  - Although most of the care received by bipolar patients occurs during the
      maintenance phase, relatively little empirical data is available to guide
      long-term treatment decisions. We review literature pertaining to key questions
      related to use of pharmacotherapy in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder.
      The few double-blind trials with a reasonable sample size are restricted to
      bipolar I patients and address a modest range of questions mostly related to use 
      of lithium. One rigorous multicenter trial found valproate to have prophylactic
      benefit. Other studies with valproate alone and in combination suggest efficacy
      equivalent to lithium and perhaps greater than carbamazepine. Data available for 
      combination treatment are sparse but moderately encouraging. Maintenance
      treatment with standard antidepressant medications appears destabilizing for some
      bipolar patients, particularly following a mixed episode. Although some bipolar
      patients may benefit from combined treatment with a mood stabilizer and a
      standard antidepressant medication, current knowledge does not allow confident
      selection of the bipolar patients who might benefit. Clozapine and perhaps other 
      atypical antipsychotics are promising options for maintenance treatment but have 
      not been evaluated in double-blind trials. The numerous other agents used in
      maintenance treatment are primarily adjuncts to lithium, valproate, or
      carbamazepine, and information about them is largely anecdotal and uncontrolled. 
      Study design for maintenance trials remains an imperfect art. Conclusions must be
      drawn cautiously, given the limited generalizability of study designs that
      accession samples enriched with presumed treatment responders, randomize patients
      after brief periods of partial remission, abruptly taper prior treatment, make no
      attempt to distinguish relapse from recurrence, use no formal outcome
      assessments, or report hospitalization as the only outcome criterion.

TI  - Pharmacologic agents for the treatment of acute bipolar mania.
PG  - 539-57
AB  - The knowledge base regarding the medical treatment of acute bipolar mania is
      rapidly expanding. Information about agents with established antimanic properties
      is increasing, and more agents with putative antimanic properties are being
      identified. We first review the controlled studies supporting the efficacy of the
      established antimanic agents lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine and standard
      antipsychotics. We then review available research on two important classes of
      drugs that are emerging as potential treatments for acute mania: the novel
      antipsychotics, which include clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and
      ziprasidone, and the new antiepileptics, which include gabapentin, lamotrigine,
      oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topiramate, and zonisamide. We conclude that although
      controlled data are accumulating to support the efficacy of several atypical
      antipsychotics in the treatment of acute bipolar mania, particularly olanzapine, 
      ziprasidone, and risperidone, the novel antiepileptics need more extensive study 
      before it can be concluded that any of them possess specific antimanic
      properties. We also conclude that as the medical options for acute bipolar mania 
      expand, treatment guidelines must remain both evidence based and flexible, so
      that they represent cutting edge medical science yet can be tailored to the
      specific needs of individual patients.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of clozapine compared with conventional antipsychotic
      medication for patients in state hospitals.
PG  - 987-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: An open-label, randomized controlled trial compared clozapine with
      physicians'-choice medications among long-term state hospital inpatients in
      Connecticut. The goal was to examine clozapine's cost-effectiveness in routine
      practice for people experiencing lengthy hospitalizations. METHODS: Long-stay
      patients with schizophrenia in a state hospital were randomly assigned to begin
      open-label clozapine (n = 138) or to continue receiving conventional
      antipsychotic medications (n = 89). We interviewed study participants every 4
      months for 2 years to assess psychiatric symptoms and functional status, and we
      collected continuous measures of prescribed medications, service utilization, and
      other costs. We used both parametric and nonparametric techniques to examine
      changes in cost and parametric analyses to examine changes in effectiveness. We
      used bootstrap techniques to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and
      create cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Both groups incurred
      similar costs during the 2-year study period, with a trend for clozapine to be
      less costly than usual care in the second study year. Clozapine was more
      effective than usual care on many but not all measures. With the use of
      effectiveness measures that favored clozapine (extrapyramidal side effects,
      disruptiveness), bootstrap techniques indicated that, even when a payer is
      unwilling to incur any additional cost for gains in effectiveness, the
      probability that clozapine is more cost-effective than usual care is at least
      0.80. These findings were not as evident when outcomes where clozapine was not
      clearly superior (psychotic symptoms, weight gain) were examined. CONCLUSION:
      Clozapine demonstrated cost-effectiveness on some but not all measures of
      effectiveness when the alternative was a range of conventional antipsychotic
      medications.

TI  - Intravenous biperiden in akathisia: an open pilot study.
PG  - 185-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antipsychotic-induced akathisia can be distressing and unendurable for
      prolonged periods. It has been shown that intramuscular biperiden is a relatively
      rapid and effective treatment for akathisia. However, the intravenous
      administration of biperiden may provide a more rapid effect, although this
      remains to be definitively proven. METHOD: The subjects obtained for this study
      met the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia as defined by the Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). The therapeutic effect of i.v.
      and i.m. biperiden was studied in an open clinical trial in twenty-three (12 male
      and 11 female) patients who developed antipsychotic-induced acute akathisia as
      defined by the research criteria of the DSM-IV. Following the development of
      akathisia, 5 mg of biperiden was intravenously injected in seventeen patients and
      intramuscularly in six patients. The therapeutic effect of biperiden on akathisia
      was clinically assessed by using the rating scale of Barnes. RESULTS: Following
      i.v. administration on biperiden, the mean time to onset and maximum effect
      occurred 1.6 (SD = 1.9) and 9.2 minutes (SD = 6.0), respectively. Furthermore, at
      the time of maximal effect, akathisia was completely ameliorated in all patients.
      The side effects reported were mild and transient. Following i.m. administration,
      the mean time to onset and maximum effect were 30.5 (SD = 5.9) and 50 minutes (SD
      = 7.4), respectively. Thus, the time to maximal effect was significantly less (40
      minutes) after i.v. compared to i.m. administration. CONCLUSION: These results
      suggest that i.v. administration of 5 mg of biperiden could be used to provide a 
      rapid and effective treatment for patients with severe akathisia.

TI  - Low-dose olanzapine for levodopa induced dyskinesias.
PG  - 795-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of low-dose olanzapine (2.5 to 7. 5 mg/day)
      for Levodopa-induced-dyskinesias (LID) in patients with PD. METHODS: Ten patients
      with PD and LID took part in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind,
      crossover trial. Patients received a 2-week course of olanzapine or placebo in
      each treatment phase with 1-week washout in between. Dyskinesias were assessed at
      baseline and after each treatment period with an acute dopaminergic challenge and
      unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) questionnaires. Patients also kept on/off and
      dyskinesia diaries for the last 3 days prior to each assessment. RESULTS: There
      was a 41% difference in dyskinesia reduction on olanzapine compared to placebo,
      as measured by objective dyskinesia rating scales (mean percentage reduction
      abnormal involuntary movement score: 30% versus -11.2%, p < 0.02). Similar
      differences were demonstrated by patient diaries (mean reduction: 46% versus -2%,
      p < 0.02) and UPDRS items 32 and 33. Compared with placebo, treatment with
      olanzapine resulted in significant increases in 'off' time as measured by patient
      diaries (30% versus 2%) and reported adverse events (1.7 versus 0.1) including
      increased parkinsonism (1.1 versus 0.1) and a nonsignificant reported increase in
      drowsiness. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose olanzapine is effective in reducing dyskinesias
      in PD, but even at very low doses can result in unacceptable increases in
      parkinsonism and 'off' time.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare olanzapine and clozapine for safety and efficacy measures
      of psychosis and motor function in patients with PD and chronic hallucinations.
      BACKGROUND: Hallucinations occur in approximately one third of patients with PD
      treated chronically with dopaminergic drugs. Although clozapine is known to be an
      effective antipsychotic agent that does not significantly exacerbate
      parkinsonism, its use requires frequent blood count assessment. Olanzapine is
      another novel antipsychotic that is not associated with blood dyscrasia, and if
      equally effective could become the preferred drug for treating hallucinations in 
      subjects with PD. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, parallel comparison of
      olanzapine and clozapine in patients with PD with chronic hallucinations was
      conducted. The primary outcome measure was the Scale for the Assessment of
      Positive Symptoms (SAPS) for psychotic symptoms. The Unified Parkinson's Disease 
      Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor subscale was used as a secondary outcome measure and
      as a safety monitoring tool. RESULTS: After 15 patients had completed the study, 
      safety stopping rules were invoked because of exacerbated parkinsonism in
      olanzapine-treated subjects. UPDRS motor impairment scores from baseline to study
      end significantly increased with olanzapine treatment, and change scores between 
      the olanzapine and clozapine groups significantly differed. The primary clinical 
      domains responsible for the motor decline were gait and bradykinesia. Even with a
      smaller patient number than originally anticipated, clozapine significantly
      improved hallucinations and overall behavioral assessment, whereas olanzapine had
      no effect. CONCLUSIONS: At the doses studied, olanzapine aggravates parkinsonism 
      in comparison with clozapine and should not be regularly used in the management
      of hallucinations in patients with PD.

AB  - Health-related quality of life in schizophrenia can be assessed by direct patient
      response or by a rating based on a structured interview. This study compares both
      types of instruments using a series of five standards: (1) sensitivity to change 
      over time, (2) sensitivity to treatment effect, (3) correlation with symptom
      severity, (4) correlation with global clinical ratings, and (5) correlation with 
      other measures of health-related quality of life. Four hundred and twenty-three
      inpatients with schizophrenia participating in a clinical trial comparing
      clozapine and haloperidol (VA Cooperative Study in Health Services #17) were
      evaluated using multiple measures of health-related quality of life (Lehman
      Quality of Life Interview; Heinrichs-Carpenter-Hanlon Quality of Life Scale;
      Strauss-Carpenter Level of Function scale, and clinical response.) The Quality of
      Life Interview showed less sensitivity to change and treatment effect, as well as
      lower correlations with all other measures than the Quality of Life Scale and the
      Level of Function scale. The latter scales showed high sensitivity to both change
      and treatment effect, and moderate-high correlations with other measures and with
      each other. The Quality of Life Scale and the Level of Function scale rater
      assessments appeared to be substantially more sensitive to subtle change and
      treatment effects than the patient-reported Quality of Life Interview for
      clinical trials. Health-related quality of life in schizophrenia is a more
      heterogeneous concept than previously appreciated.

AB  - Hypodopaminergic and hyponoradrenergic pathophysiology may be a basis for primary
      and/or secondary negative symptoms in schizophrenia. The hypothesis that enhanced
      neurotransmission in these systems would be therapeutic for negative symptoms was
      tested by comparing mazindol and placebo in a double-blind, cross-over design
      trial. Outcome following mazindol supplementation was comparable to placebo
      supplementation (F(1,30) = 0.9; p = .57). Results for deficit and non-deficit
      schizophrenia subjects were similar, and were not affected by whether concurrent 
      the antipsychotic drug treatment was clozapine, fluphenazine, or haloperidol. The
      efficacy hypothesis was not supported for either primary or secondary negative
      symptoms.

PG  - 185-8, 264, 263
AB  - Schizophrenia is associated with brain abnormalities and is typically evidenced
      by disorganized speech and behavior, delusions, and hallucinations; it usually
      requires extended hospitalization. Its incidence in the western world is
      estimated at 4-7 cases/10,000/year. A method of shortening hospitalization and
      improving level of functioning is the use of unique medication, including
      clozapine, which has been in use in Israel for the past 6 years. We report 327
      patients who participated in a community rehabilitation program and were treated 
      with clozapine. They were compared with 417 patients who corresponded to the
      guidelines of the Director of Mental Health Services for treatment with
      clozapine, but were not treated with it for reasons not defined in the
      guidelines. The study included those 25-44 and 45-64 years of age and according
      to the division of the population of patients hospitalized in both government and
      private hospitals. The project demonstrates the savings from use of clozapine as 
      opposed to the alternative of hospitalizing these patients. It also shows the
      complexity and difficulty in assimilating new technologies, in relation to the
      influence of social considerations and supplier/insurer accounting on the
      patterns of technological assimilation.

TI  - Single-dose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine in subjects with renal or hepatic
      impairment.
PG  - 521-33
AB  - 1. The atypical antipsychotic quetiapine ('Seroquel') provides equivalent
      efficacy to the typical antipsychotics chlorpromazine and haloperidol in the
      short-term treatment of schizophrenia. Moreover, the incidence of extrapyramidal 
      symptoms associated with quetiapine treatment is equivalent to that observed with
      placebo treatment, which may lead to increased patient compliance with quetiapine
      compared with typical antipsychotics. 2. This report presents the results from
      two small studies aimed at determining the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine in
      nonpsychotic subjects with renal or hepatic impairment. Equal numbers of impaired
      subjects and healthy control subjects were administered a single, 25 mg dose of
      quetiapine, and plasma concentrations were determined up to 48 hr after dosing.
      3. No clinically significant differences were found when the pharmacokinetic
      parameters for subjects with renal or hepatic impairment were compared with those
      for healthy control subjects. The results indicate that dosage adjustment of
      quetiapine may be unnecessary in psychotic patients with decreased renal
      function. 4. In subjects with hepatic impairment related to alcoholic cirrhosis, 
      the results suggest that no change is needed in the recommended quetiapine
      starting dose (25 mg). However, because of a noted inter-subject variability in
      the clearance of quetiapine in the cirrhotic group, it is recommended that dose
      escalation be performed with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 5. The 
      single dose of quetiapine 25 mg generally was well tolerated in nonpsychotic
      subjects in good health or with either renal or hepatic impairments. Quetiapine
      also had no effect on the endogenous creatinine clearance of renally impaired or 
      healthy control subjects.

TI  - Efficacy, cardiac safety and tolerability of sertindole: a drug surveillance.
PG  - 207-14
AB  - Sertindole is a novel atypical antipsychotic, which has shown efficacy in the
      treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia in phase II and III 
      studies. Furthermore, these studies have demonstrated tolerability and a
      favourable side-effect profile. In contrast to classical antipsychotics,
      sertindole was not associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). We report drug 
      surveillance data in 34 comorbid and comedicated sertindole treated patients
      suffering from different psychotic disorders. The drug surveillance consisted of 
      two distinct phases: inpatient treatment and outpatient follow-up. Clinical
      global impression (severity and improvement of illness), psychotic symptoms,
      side-effects, and blood parameters have been carefully documented. With special
      respect to cardiac safety electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been recorded twice
      (during sertindole treatment and during treatment with an antipsychotic different
      from sertindole). Recommended ECG-parameters for assessment of the proarrhythmic 
      risk of a drug have been calculated (QTc-, QTc2-interval; QT-, QTc-dispersion).
      The majority of patients (n = 29) have been treated previously with several
      typical and/or atypical antipsychotics. We observed a clinical response to
      sertindole treatment in 29 patients (85%). Both positive and negative symptoms
      improved with sertindole and no severe side-effects have been documented. EPS
      occurred at placebo level. A mean QTc-interval prolongation of 19.7 ms (4.7%) has
      been detected. None of the patients developed clinical or electrocardiographic
      evidence of cardiac dysrhythmia during sertindole treatment, or other clinical
      evidence of cardiac abnormalities. In summary, sertindole did show efficacy for
      positive and negative symptoms together with a favourable side-effect profile. No
      evidence for an increased proarrhythmic risk has been found.

PG  - 157-70
AB  - Sir Ronald Fisher used a single-subject design to derive the concepts of
      appropriate research design, randomization, sensitivity, and tests of statistical
      significance. The seminal work of Broca demonstrated that valid and generalizable
      findings can and have emerged from studies of a single patient in
      neuropsychology. In order to assess the reliability and/or validity of any
      clinical phenomena that derive from single subject research, it becomes necessary
      to apply appropriate biostatistical methodology. The authors develop just such an
      approach and apply it successfully to the evaluation of the functioning, quality 
      of life, and neuropsychological symptomatology of a single schizophrenic patient.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of risperidone and clozapine in the treatment of patients
      with refractory schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder: a retrospective
      analysis.
PG  - 498-504
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine is effective in up to 60% of patients with refractory
      schizophrenia, whereas the efficacy of risperidone remains unknown. This
      retrospective study examined the relative efficacy of these drugs in chronically 
      institutionalized patients refractory to conventional antipsychotic agents.
      METHOD: A total of 24 patients who at different time periods had received
      adequate trials of both clozapine and risperidone and met our inclusion criteria 
      for minimum dose and duration of each trial were included; for clozapine, a
      minimum dose of 300 mg/day had to be maintained for at least 12 weeks, and for
      risperidone, a minimum dose of 6 mg/day for at least 6 weeks. Information
      obtained from systematic retrospective chart review was blindly rated by 2
      psychiatrists using the 7-point Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I)
      scale on overall clinical state and along specific symptom domains of positive
      symptoms, negative symptoms, and aggressive behavior. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD
      dose was 520+/-94 mg/day for clozapine and 7.5+/-2.2 mg/day for risperidone.
      Fourteen patients (58%) were classified as responders to clozapine, while 6 (25%)
      responded to risperidone (CGI-I score of 1 or 2); on specific symptom domains,
      response rates to clozapine were 38% (9/24) on positive symptoms, 29% (7/24) on
      negative symptoms, and 71% (12/17) on aggressive behavior. For risperidone,
      response rates were 17% (4/24) on positive symptoms, 8% (2/24) on negative
      symptoms, and 41% (7/17) on aggressive behavior. CONCLUSION: The results of this 
      study support the utility of first giving a risperidone trial in a treatment
      algorithm for refractory patients because of its better risk/benefit profile
      compared with clozapine. Clozapine, however, remains our gold standard in the
      management of these patients.

TI  - Olanzapine in severe Gilles de la Tourette syndrome: a 52-week double-blind
      cross-over study vs. low-dose pimozide.
PG  - 443-6
AB  - We selected four patients with severe Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, high
      frequency of tics (two to ten per minute), vocalizations, and lack of
      comorbidity. These patients (aged 19-40 years) underwent a 52-week double-blind
      cross-over study with olanzapine (5 and 10 mg daily) vs. low-dose pimozide (2 and
      4 mg daily). The reduction in rating scale scores for the syndrome was highly
      significant with 10 mg olanzapine vs. basal and vs. 2 mg pimozide, and was
      significant for 5 mg olanzapine vs. 4 mg pimozide. Only moderate sedation was
      reported by one patient during olanzapine treatment while three complained of
      minor motor side effects and sedation during pimozide treatment. At the end of
      the study all patients opted for olanzapine treatment.

TI  - Risperidone for the treatment of stuttering.
PG  - 479-82
AB  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the 
      efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of developmental stuttering in 16
      adults. Eight subjects received placebo and eight received risperidone at 0.5 mg 
      once daily at night, increased to a maximum of 2 mg/day. After 6 weeks of
      treatment, decreases in all measures of stuttering severity were greater in the
      risperidone group than in the placebo group; the between-treatment difference was
      significant (p < 0.05) on the most important measure, the percentage of syllables
      stuttered. In the risperidone group, reductions from baseline in scores for the
      percentage of syllables stuttered, time stuttering as a percentage of total time 
      speaking, and overall stuttering severity were significant (p < 0.01); changes in
      scores on the fourth measure of stuttering, duration, were not significant. No
      significant decreases occurred in the placebo group. Among the eight patients in 
      the risperidone group, five responded best to 0.5 mg/day, with stuttering
      recurring at higher doses. The remaining three patients responded better with
      increasing doses of risperidone. Risperidone was generally well tolerated. The
      results of this small study indicate that risperidone may be effective in the
      treatment of developmental stuttering. This finding needs to be confirmed in a
      larger trial.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone addition in serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 794-801
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, only 1 controlled study has found a drug (haloperidol) to be
      efficacious in augmenting response in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder
      (OCD) refractory to serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) monotherapy; patients with
      comorbid chronic tic disorders showed a preferential response. This report
      describes the first controlled study of risperidone addition in patients with OCD
      refractory to treatment with SRI alone. METHODS: Seventy adult patients with a
      primary DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD received 12 weeks of treatment with an SRI.
      Thirty-six patients were refractory to the SRI and were randomized in a
      double-blind manner to 6 weeks of risperidone (n = 20) or placebo (n = 16)
      addition. Behavioral ratings, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive
      Scale, were obtained at baseline and throughout the trial. Placebo-treated
      patients subsequently received an identical open-label trial of risperidone
      addition. RESULTS: For study completers, 9 (50%) of 18 risperidone-treated
      patients were responders (mean daily dose, 2.2 +/-0.7 mg/d) compared with 0 of 15
      in the placebo addition group (P<. 005). Seven (50%) of 14 patients who received 
      open-label risperidone addition responded. Risperidone addition was superior to
      placebo in reducing OCD (P<.001), depressive (P<.001), and anxiety (P =.003)
      symptoms. There was no difference in response between OCD patients with and
      without comorbid diagnoses of chronic tic disorder or schizotypal personalty
      disorder. Other than mild, transient sedation, risperidone was well tolerated.
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that OCD patients with and without comorbid
      chronic tic disorders or schizotypal personality disorder may respond to the
      addition of low-dose risperidone to ongoing SRI therapy.

TI  - Striatal and temporal cortical D2/D3 receptor occupancy by olanzapine and
      sertindole in vivo: a [123I]epidepride single photon emission tomography (SPET)
      study.
PG  - 132-40
AB  - RATIONALE: Previous work suggests clozapine preferentially targets limbic
      cortical dopamine systems, which could help account for its lack of
      extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and superior therapeutic efficacy. OBJECTIVES: 
      To test the hypothesis that olanzapine, a novel atypical antipsychotic drug,
      occupies temporal cortical D2/D3 receptors to a greater extent than striatal
      D2/D3 receptors in vivo. METHODS: Nine schizophrenic patients taking either
      olanzapine [(n=5; mean (SD) age: 32.5 (6.5) years; daily dose: 18.3 (2.6) mg] or 
      sertindole [(n=4; mean (SD) age: 30.3 (7.4) years; daily dose: 16 (5.6) mg] were 
      studied with [123I]epidepride
      ((S)-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-5-iodo-2,3-dimethoxybenz amide) and
      single photon emission tomography (SPET). An estimate of [123I]epidepride
      'specific binding' to D2/D3 receptors was obtained in patients and age-matched
      healthy volunteers. A summary measure was generated representing striatal and
      temporal cortical relative %D2/D3 receptor occupancy by antipsychotic drugs.
      Occupancy data were compared with previously studied groups of patients receiving
      typical antipsychotic drugs (n=12) and clozapine (n=10). RESULTS: Mean striatal
      and temporal cortical %D2/D3 receptor occupancy in olanzapine-treated patients
      was 41.3% (SD 17.9) and 82.8% (SD 4.2), respectively. Unexpectedly low levels of 
      striatal relative %D2/D3 receptor occupancy were seen in two patients with
      typical antipsychotic-drug-induced movement disorder prior to switching to
      olanzapine. In the temporal cortex, mean D2/D3 dopamine receptor occupancy levels
      above 80% were seen for all antipsychotic drugs studied. CONCLUSIONS: The
      atypical antipsychotic drugs olanzapine and sertindole, in common with clozapine,
      demonstrate higher occupancy of temporal cortical than striatal D2/D3 dopamine
      receptors in vivo at clinically useful doses. This could help mediate their
      atypical clinical profile of therapeutic efficacy with few extrapyramidal side
      effects. Limbic selective blockade of D2/D3 dopamine receptors could be a common 
      action of atypical antipsychotic drugs.

TI  - H(2) antagonist nizatidine may control olanzapine-associated weight gain in
      schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 167-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Olanzapine is temporally associated, in a number of patients with
      schizophrenia, with weight gain. H(2) antagonists, like nizatidine, have been
      shown to control appetite in overweight patients. METHODS: A patient with
      olanzapine temporally associated weight gain was treated with nizatidine as
      "add-on" therapy. RESULTS: Nizatidine treatment was associated with good control 
      and subsequent reduction of weight after 4 to 5 weeks of therapy in a patient
      with repetitive episodes of weight gain during olanzapine treatment. Olanzapine
      was otherwise well tolerated and effective in controlling psychopathology.
      CONCLUSIONS: H(2) antagonist treatment with olanzapine may be a valid medical
      strategy in preventing and/or reducing weight gain in patients with
      schizophrenia. Controlled studies are recommended to confirm this observation.

TI  - The pharmacotherapy of target symptoms associated with autistic disorder and
      other pervasive developmental disorders.
PG  - 45-63
AB  - Research into the pharmacotherapy of autistic disorder has steadily increased
      over the past two decades. Several psychoactive medications have shown efficacy
      for selected symptoms of autistic disorder and can be used to augment critical
      educational and behavioral interventions that are the mainstays of treatment. A
      comprehensive review of medication trials conducted in individuals with autistic 
      disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders is presented. The typical
      antipsychotic haloperidol is the best-studied medication in autistic disorder but
      is associated with a high rate of dyskinesias. Investigations to date suggest
      that the atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone have efficacy for certain
      symptoms of autistic disorder and may be better tolerated than typical
      antipsychotics. Preliminary results from trials with serotonin-reuptake
      inhibitors are favorable, although efficacy has not been demonstrated in younger 
      age groups. Recent controlled studies of nalfrexone suggest that the drug has
      minimal efficacy. In two small controlled investigations, clonidine was more
      effective than placebo for a variety of symptoms, including hyperactivity and
      irritability; in one of these studies, however, the majority of patients relapsed
      within several months. Psychostimulants reduced hyperactivity and irritability in
      one small double-blind crossover study in children with autistic disorder,
      although these agents are frequently reported to exacerbate irritability,
      insomnia, and aggression in clinical populations. Recent controlled trials of
      secretin have not shown efficacy compared to placebo. Several other medications, 
      including buspirone, mood stabilizers, and beta-blockers, have produced symptom
      reduction in some open-label studies and may warrant controlled investigation.

TI  - Electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients treated with clozapine.
PG  - 441-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular side effects of clozapine are not uncommon, but few
      systematic studies of these effects have been performed. In this study, we
      reviewed data on the electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities in patients treated
      with clozapine. METHOD: Sixty-one patients treated with clozapine were selected
      from the Seoul National University Hospital Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia
      Clinic. A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify ECG abnormalities 
      and cardiovascular side effects. RESULTS: The prevalence of ECG abnormalities in 
      patients who had been using antipsychotics other than clozapine was 13.6% at
      baseline, which increased significantly to 31.1% after commencement of clozapine 
      treatment. Among the 53 patients without baseline ECG abnormalities, 13 showed
      new-onset ECG abnormalities after using clozapine. Normal ECG under previous
      antipsychotic medication reduced the risk of new-onset ECG abnormalities, whereas
      increased age was found to increase the risk. The occurrence of orthostatic
      hypotension or tachycardia was not related to the development of ECG
      abnormalities. Most of the newly developed abnormalities had little clinical
      significance, and they tended to occur during the initial phase of treatment. In 
      10 patients, ECGs normalized despite the continued use of clozapine. Clozapine
      increased corrected QT interval (QTc) in a dose-dependent fashion; however, the
      clinical significance of this observation is uncertain. Pathologic prolongation
      of QTc was found to be rare. CONCLUSION: Although a substantial portion of
      patients treated with clozapine developed ECG abnormalities, most of the
      abnormalities were benign and did not hinder further treatment.

TI  - The effects of clozapine on alcohol and drug use disorders among patients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 441-9
AB  - Several case studies indicate that clozapine use is associated with reductions in
      the use of nicotine, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Although not designed to assess
      clozapine, this study explored a posteriori the effects of clozapine on alcohol
      and drug use disorders among schizophrenia patients. Among 151 patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and co-occurring substance use disorder
      who were studied in a dual-disorder treatment program, 36 received clozapine
      during the study for standard clinical indications. All participants were
      assessed prospectively at baseline and every 6 months over 3 years for
      psychiatric symptoms and substance use. Alcohol-abusing patients taking clozapine
      experienced significant reductions in severity of alcohol abuse and days of
      alcohol use while on clozapine. For example, they averaged 54.1 drinking days
      during 6-month intervals while off clozapine and 12.5 drinking days while on
      clozapine. They also improved more than patients who did not receive clozapine.
      At the end of the study, 79.0 percent of the patients on clozapine were in
      remission from alcohol use disorder for 6 months or longer, while only 33.7
      percent of those not taking clozapine were remitted. Findings related to other
      drugs in relation to clozapine were also positive but less clear because of the
      small number of patients with drug use disorders. This study was limited by the
      naturalistic design and the lack of prospective, standardized measures of
      clozapine use. The use of clozapine by patients with co-occurring substance
      disorders deserves further study in randomized clinical trials.

TI  - Clozapine augmentation: safety and efficacy.
PG  - 421-40
AB  - While clozapine has been demonstrated to be efficacious in refractory
      schizophrenia and possibly schizoaffective as well as bipolar disorders, a
      substantial number of patients still remain unresponsive. One strategy in
      treating these refractory patients is to augment clozapine with other somatic
      treatments. This article reviews the efficacy and safety of the combination of
      clozapine with other somatic treatments. A total of 70 articles were obtained
      from a manual, as well as computerized (Medline), search of the English language 
      literature from 1978 to March 1998. Few controlled studies exist; most were case 
      reports/series. From these data, the greatest risk of adverse effects seems to be
      associated with clozapine combined with benzodiazepines, valproate, or lithium,
      but no currently evaluated combination is absolutely unsafe. In terms of
      efficacy, the data suggest a number of potential augmentation strategies,
      although controlled data are few. Combination therapies with clozapine are common
      in clinical practice, despite a lack of empirical data, and the benefits and
      risks of these combinations need to be systematically reviewed.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone in plasma by
      liquid chromatography/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 718-24
AB  - A simple and highly sensitive liquid chromatographic/electrospray tandem mass
      spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) assay was developed for the simultaneous determination
      of risperidone (RSP) and its major circulating metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone
      (9-OH-RSP) in the plasma of humans and rats. A simple one-step solvent extraction
      with 15% methylene chloride in pentane was used to isolate the compounds from
      plasma. The compounds were eluted from a phenyl-hexyl column and detected with a 
      Perkin-Elmer SCIEX API2000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer using positive ion
      atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization and multiple reaction monitoring.
      The assay was linear over the range 0.1-100 ng ml(-1) when 0.5 ml of plasma was
      used in the extraction. The overall intra- (within-day) and inter- (between days)
      assay variations were < 11%. The variations in the concentrations of two
      long-term quality control samples from pooled patient plasma samples analyzed
      over a period of 6 months were approximately 10%. The analysis time for each
      sample was 4 min and more than 100 samples could be analyzed in one day by
      running the system overnight. The assay is simple, highly sensitive, selective,
      precise and fast. This method is being used for the therapeutic drug monitoring
      of schizophrenic patients treated with RSP and to study the pharmacokinetics and 
      tissue distribution of RSP and 9-OH-RSP in rats.

      quality of life.
PG  - 135-45
AB  - This study compared the effectiveness of conventional and novel antipsychotic
      drugs from a patient's perspective. Five comparable groups of schizophrenic
      patients (n=230) clinically stabilized on conventional antipsychotic drugs,
      risperidone, olanzepine, quetiapine or clozapine for a period of 6months or
      longer were cross-sectionally evaluated. Patients' clinical symptom profile,
      subjective responses and attitudes toward drugs, prevalence of dysphoria,
      akathisia, abnormal involuntary movements and Parkinsonian symptoms, and quality 
      of life were ascertained using standardized rating scales. Between-group
      differences were examined with analysis of variance and chi-square tests.
      Patients receiving novel antipsychotic drugs experienced fewer side-effects,
      reported positive subjective responses and favourable attitudes toward their
      treatment, and revealed a lower prevalence of neuroleptic dysphoria. The
      differences were statistically significant (p<0.05) with the risperidone,
      olanzepine and quetiapine groups. Self-rated quality of life, measured with the
      sickness impact profile, was also significantly better among patients receiving
      novel antipsychotic drugs. These perceived benefits, however, were not reflected 
      in the clinician rated (objective) measures of psychosocial functioning and
      quality of life. These findings substantiate the general notion that novel
      antipsychotic medications are uniformly better tolerated as indicated by the
      measures of subjective responses, side-effects and self rated quality of life.

TI  - A comparison of the effects of clozapine and olanzapine on the EEG in patients
      with schizophrenia.
PG  - 109-11
AB  - Clozapine is known to induce epileptic seizures and changes in EEG-patterns,
      including slowing and the appearance of epileptiform activity. Olanzapine, a new 
      antipsychotic drug, shares many pharmacological and clinical properties with
      clozapine. However, in patients treated with olanzapine, no case of seizure
      induction has been reported so far, and the EEG has not been studied
      systematically. We examined the EEGs of patients with schizophrenia treated with 
      either olanzapine (N = 9) or clozapine (N = 9) prior to medication and 3 to 7
      weeks afterwards. Clozapine induced significant EEG slowing present in 78% of the
      patients, and definite epileptiform activity appeared in 33%. Olanzapine also
      induced significant EEG slowing, but less frequently (in 44% of the patients) and
      less pronounced than clozapine. Olanzapine had no significant effect an
      epileptiform activity, but in one patient, an isolated sharp/slow-wave complex
      was observed. These preliminary data suggest that olanzapine induces EEG slowing 
      to a lower extent than clozapine. Olanzapine's possible effect an the seizure
      threshold deserves further attention.

TI  - Medication continuation and compliance: a comparison of patients treated with
      clozapine and haloperidol.
PG  - 382-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares medication continuation and regimen compliance
      with the atypical antipsychotic medication clozapine versus the conventional
      antipsychotic haloperidol. METHOD: Data from a 15-site double-blind, randomized
      clinical trial (N = 423) were used to compare patients with DSM-III-R
      schizophrenia assigned to clozapine or haloperidol in terms of duration of
      participation while taking the randomly assigned study drug (continuation) and
      the proportion of prescribed pills that were taken (compliance). Multiple
      regression analysis was used to determine the relationship of baseline
      characteristics and measures of clinical change to continuation for the entire
      sample and for patients assigned to each medication. RESULTS: Patients assigned
      to clozapine continued taking the study drug for a mean of 35.5 weeks as compared
      with only 27.2 among patients assigned to haloperidol (F = 4.45, df = 1,422; p = 
      .0001). No differences were found between the groups in the proportion of
      prescribed pills that were returned at any timepoint. Among patients assigned to 
      haloperidol, poorer continuation was associated with being older and greater
      continuation with receiving public support. Among patients on clozapine
      treatment, continuation was poorer among African American patients and greater
      among patients who showed reduced clinical symptoms and akathisia. Continuation
      with clozapine was greater even after adjusting for these factors. CONCLUSION:
      Continuation with medication is greater with clozapine than haloperidol and is
      partly explained by greater symptom improvement and reduced side effects. No
      differences were found in regimen compliance.

TI  - Clozapine for treatment-refractory schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and
      psychotic bipolar disorder: a 24-month naturalistic study.
PG  - 329-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the 24-month response to
      clozapine in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic 
      bipolar disorder. METHOD: Ninety-one psychotic patients with a principal
      DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia (N = 31), schizoaffective disorder (N = 26),
      or bipolar disorder with psychotic features (N = 34) were treated
      naturalistically with clozapine at flexible dosages over a 24-month period.
      Improvement was assessed by the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the
      Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale. RESULTS: All patients
      showed significant improvement 24 months from intake (p < .001). Such an
      improvement was significantly greater among patients with schizoaffective
      disorder or bipolar disorder than in patients with schizophrenia (p < .05). The
      presence of suicidal ideation at intake predicted greater improvement at
      endpoint. CONCLUSION: Clozapine appears to be effective and relatively well
      tolerated in acute and long-term treatment of patients with psychotic bipolar
      disorder or schizoaffective disorder who have not responded to conventional
      pharmacotherapies.

TI  - [New i.e. atypical neuroleptic agents for negative symptoms of schizophrenia:
      results and methodological problems of evaluation].
PG  - 345-53
AB  - The results of controlled studies of the efficacy of the new atypical
      neuroleptics in treating negative symptoms show that these antipsychotics have a 
      more pronounced effect on negative symptoms in acute schizophrenic patients than 
      the classical neuroleptics. Supplementary complex statistical analyses
      substantiate that the increased efficacy of the atypical neuroleptics in treating
      negative symptoms can only partially be explained by indirect effects of better
      extrapyramidal tolerability, better effects on productive psychotic symptoms,
      etc. Instead, it is due largely to the stronger direct effect of these atypical
      neuroleptics. Clinical studies to evaluate their efficacy in chronic
      schizophrenic patients with stable, predominantly negative symptoms are still
      mostly lacking. First results support the presumption that atypical neuroleptics 
      have a direct effect. Parallel to the evaluation of the new atypical
      neuroleptics, important progress has been made in the methodology of clinical
      studies in this area.

TI  - A positron emission tomography study of quetiapine in schizophrenia: a
      preliminary finding of an antipsychotic effect with only transiently high
      dopamine D2 receptor occupancy.
PG  - 553-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quetiapine is a new atypical antipsychotic medication. As such,
      relatively little has been published regarding its in vivo effects at the
      dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2a (5-HT2a) receptor systems. The
      following study was undertaken to explore these effects across the clinical dose 
      range and relate this information to its clinical profile. METHODS: Twelve
      patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to doses of 150 to 600 mg/d
      (n=3, at 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/d) of quetiapine. After 3 weeks of treatment, 
      D2 and 5-HT2a occupancy were measured using positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging, 12 to 14 hours after the last dose. Clinical efficacy and adverse effect
      ratings were obtained at baseline, at the time of PET scanning, and at 12 weeks. 
      Two additional patients were included to examine the effects of the drug 2 to 3
      hours after last dose. RESULTS: Quetiapine was an effective antipsychotic and
      improved the extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation noted at
      baseline. It achieved these results with minimal (0%-27%) D2 occupancy 12 hours
      after the last dose. Study of the additional subjects revealed that quetiapine
      does give rise to transiently high (58%-64%) D2 occupancy 2 to 3 hours after a
      single dose that then decreases to minimal levels in 12 hours. CONCLUSIONS:
      Quetiapine shows a transiently high D2 occupancy, which decreases to very low
      levels by the end of the dosing interval. Quetiapine's low D2 occupancy can
      explain its freedom from extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation.
      The data suggest that transient D2 occupancy may be sufficient for its
      antipsychotic effect. Future studies controlling for nonpharmacological effects
      as well as activities on other receptors will be necessary to confirm this
      suggestion.

TI  - Reduced phosphodiesters and high-energy phosphates in the frontal lobe of
      schizophrenic patients: a (31)P chemical shift spectroscopic-imaging study.
PG  - 954-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: (31)Phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been widely used 
      to evaluate schizophrenic patients in comparison to control subjects, because it 
      allows the investigation of both phospholipid and energy metabolism in vivo;
      however, the results achieved so far are inconsistent. Chemical shift imaging
      (CSI) has the advantage that instead of only one or a few preselected voxels the 
      tissue of a whole brain slice can be examined. The aim of the present
      investigation was to determine whether the results of previous studies of our
      group, showing that phosphodiesters (PDE) are decreased in the frontal lobe of
      schizophrenic patients as compared to control subjects, might be confirmed in an 
      independent unmedicated patient sample using the CSI technique. METHODS: A
      carefully selected new cohort including 11 neuroleptic-free schizophrenic
      patients and 11 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects was recruited.
      CSI was applied and an innovative analysis method for CSI data based on a general
      linear model was used. RESULTS: PDE, phosphocreatine, and adenosine triphosphate 
      (ATP) were found to be significantly decreased in the frontal lobe of patients
      with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Because PDE was decreased in schizophrenic
      patients, the membrane phospholipid hypothesis of schizophrenia could not be
      corroborated. Further results indicate decreased ATP production in the frontal
      lobe of patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Long-term safety and efficacy of amisulpride in subchronic or chronic
      schizophrenia. Amisulpride Study Group.
PG  - 13-22
AB  - Amisulpride is an atypical antipsychotic with selective affinity for dopamine
      D2/3 receptors. In this long-term, open, randomised, multicentre trial, patients 
      with chronic or subchronic schizophrenia received amisulpride (n =370) or
      haloperidol (n = 118) for 12 months. Dosage regimens were flexible (amisulpride
      200-800 mg/day, haloperidol 5-20 mg/day). Improvement in mean Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale total score was significantly greater for amisulpride than
      haloperidol (17.0 versus 12.8, P = 0.01). Positive symptoms (Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] positive) improved in a similar way in each group
      but amisulpride caused a significantly better improvement in negative symptoms
      (PANSS negative) (7.1 versus 3.7, P < 0.0001). Improvements in Global Assessment 
      of Functioning (GAF) and Quality of Life Scale (QLS) scores were also
      significantly greater in the amisulpride group (GAF -20.1 versus -13.6, P =
      0.001; QLS -0.64 versus -0.30, P = 0.02). Adverse events were mainly psychiatric 
      in nature, and occurred with similar frequency in each group (amisulpride
      254/370, 69%; haloperidol 82/118, 70%). Extrapyramidal symptoms were more
      frequent for haloperidol (48/118, 41% versus 96/370, 26% for amisulpride),
      leading to a greater requirement for antiparkinsonian medication (haloperidol
      66/118, 56% versus amisulpride 118/370, 32%). Haloperidol significantly
      aggravated parkinsonism, akathisia and involuntary movement compared to
      amisulpride. The overall incidence of endocrine events was comparable between
      groups (4% for amisulpride, 3% for haloperidol). Maintenance of efficacy was
      comparable in both treatment groups; 59% of amisulpride patients and 55% of
      haloperidol patients improved after 1 month of therapy remained improved
      throughout the study period. Amisulpride is effective following flexible
      long-term administration and significantly improves social functioning and
      quality of life.

TI  - Risperidone for the treatment of cocaine dependence: randomized, double-blind
      trial.
PG  - 305-10
AB  - A partial blockade of the multiple actions of cocaine is one strategy by which
      cocaine dependence may be treated. Risperidone, a 5-hydroxytryptamine and
      dopamine D2 antagonist, is an atypical antipsychotic and was a candidate
      medication for the treatment of cocaine dependence. One hundred ninety-three
      cocaine-dependent subjects were enrolled in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial. Subjects initially received either placebo or 4 or 8 mg
      of risperidone, with a subsequent change to active doses of 2 mg and 4 mg.
      Subjects attended the clinic twice each week, provided urine samples, obtained
      medication, and underwent one behavioral therapy session per week. The study was 
      terminated at the interim analysis. Retention was worse for the 4- and 8-mg
      active medication groups. Side effects were primarily associated with the 8-mg
      dose, although neither 2 mg nor 4 mg was well accepted by subjects. There was no 
      reduction in cocaine use associated with risperidone. The results suggest that
      although antagonists might be a useful treatment approach, such as in the
      treatment of opiate dependence, risperidone is unlikely to find broad acceptance 
      with the treatment-seeking population.

TI  - Second-generation antipsychotics in the emergency care setting. A prospective
      naturalistic study.
PG  - 107-14
AB  - The objective of this subject was to examine the impact of the replacement of
      standard neuroleptics with atypical antipsychotic agents in an intensive
      psychiatric care unit. A mirror-image study was conducted. Cases admitted in the 
      first semester of the year (when most of patients were treated with standard
      neuroleptics) were compared to cases admitted in the second semester of the year,
      when atypical antipsychotic agents were routinely utilized as first line
      treatment of patients with psychotic signs. Cases admitted in the first semester 
      received a significantly higher daily dosage of antipsychotic drugs and more
      frequently received anticholinergics. In the second semester, a significantly
      higher number of patients received anticonvulsants, in particular valproate and
      gabapentin. There was no significant difference between the two groups of cases
      in the number of patients treated with antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, lithium, 
      and carbamazepine and in the mean daily dose of benzodiazepines, lithium,
      carbamazepine, or valproate on the first day of hospitalization, the day of
      evaluation, and on discharge. On discharge, similar percentages of patients went 
      home, were transferred to other Psychiatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) or to
      private clinics, or left our PICU against medical advice. The length of
      hospitalization was similar in the two groups. There was no significant
      difference in the rate of aggressive or violent behavior registered in the two
      groups of cases. The risk of increasing violence rates, lengthening
      hospitalization, and facilitating patients' non-compliance should not be major
      concerns for physicians prescribing second-generation antipsychotics in the
      emergency care setting. Since these drugs have been shown to have at least
      similar efficacy (or greater efficacy in the case of clozapine) in the treatment 
      of psychotic disorders as typical neuroleptics and to have a better side-effects 
      profile, they should become first line treatment for patients with psychotic
      signs admitted to emergency care psychiatric facilities.

TI  - Psychosocial correlates of prepartum and postpartum depressed mood.
PG  - 31-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to delineate the influence of
      maternal stress, social support and coping styles on depressed mood during
      pregnancy and the early postpartum period. METHODS: Beginning in the third month 
      of pregnancy, data on numerous variables including daily stress (Hassles),
      state-anxiety (STAI-state), pregnancy-specific stress (PEQ) and depressed mood
      (DACL) were collected monthly. In each trimester social support (SSQ), coping
      strategies (CISS) and pregnancy progress were assessed. Approximately 4-5 weeks
      following delivery, information on labor, delivery and infant status was
      collected and the DACL and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were
      administered. The final sample consisted of 80 women. RESULTS: Approximately 16% 
      of the women in this sample experienced depressed mood in the postpartum and 25% 
      of the sample reported depressed mood only during pregnancy. Women depressed only
      during pregnancy and those depressed in the postpartum reported more emotional
      coping and higher trait and state anxiety during gestation. More hassles during
      pregnancy was related to prepartum depressed mood, but not postpartum depressed
      mood. Consistent with the literature, the best predictor of postpartum depressed 
      mood was depressed mood during pregnancy. Limitations: The sample size was
      relatively small and we relied solely on self-reported depressive symptomology.
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to specific psychosocial variables which can be
      targeted early in pregnancy to reduce the rate of depressed mood in the prepartum
      and postpartum periods.

TI  - Switching outpatients between atypical antipsychotics.
PG  - 351-5
AB  - 1. Some reports have suggested an increase in symptoms when switching patients
      with psychosis from clozapine to other atypical antipsychotics. 2. No data are
      available on switching between atypical antipsychotics other than clozapine,
      though this is common in clinical practice. 3. Six patients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type were switched to quetiapine after
      finishing a clinical trial of sertindole. 4. During the observation period of two
      to ten weeks no subjects worsened and one improved. Side effects were mild. 5.
      These preliminary data suggest that switching between some atypical agents may be
      well tolerated. Larger controlled trials are needed to confirm this observation.

TI  - Placebo-controlled trial of glycine added to clozapine in schizophrenia.
PG  - 826-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of high-dose
      oral glycine on positive and negative symptoms and cognitive function when added 
      to clozapine in adults with schizophrenia. METHOD: The authors conducted a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial of 60 g/day of glycine
      added to clozapine for 8 weeks in 30 adults with schizophrenia. Clinical ratings 
      were performed every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients completed the trial.
      Glycine augmentation of clozapine produced no statistically significant change in
      positive or negative symptoms or cognitive functioning. No subjects showed
      clinically significant worsening of clinical ratings. CONCLUSIONS: These data,
      combined with data from previous trials with D-cycloserine and glycine, suggest
      that agonists at the glycine site may be less effective when combined with
      clozapine than they are when combined with conventional antipsychotics.

TI  - Subject selection for the placebo- and comparator-controlled trials of
      neuroleptics in schizophrenia.
PG  - 240-5
AB  - It has been suggested that inclusion of a placebo treatment arm in controlled
      clinical trials might bias the selection of study subjects. Presumably, patients 
      in the placebo-controlled studies are more stable, but there are no data
      available to support such an assumption. The authors tested the hypothesis in a
      set of randomized trials of neuroleptics in treating schizophrenia by comparing
      placebo-controlled (PCTs) and comparator-controlled trials (CCTs) in terms of
      basic patient characteristics. The results, based on a total of 296 studies,
      showed that the patients in PCTs, compared with those in CCTs, were older (p <
      0.002), had a longer duration of illness (p < 0.001), and a lower initial symptom
      severity (p < 0.02). No difference was found in the number of subjects per
      treatment arm or in the proportion of female subjects. However, investigation of 
      studies which used same-gender study subjects revealed that female-only
      populations were more likely to be tested in PCTs (p < 0.03) than in CCTs. To
      investigate current trends in psychopharmacologic research, the authors tested
      separately a subset of trials of new atypical antipsychotics. The results
      indicated a significantly smaller number of females participating in the latest
      PCTs (p < 0.0003). Moreover, our findings suggest that the characteristics of
      patients in the current controlled trials are rather uniform; thus, the
      generalizability of new study findings for certain groups of patients with
      schizophrenia (e.g., with early or late onset or brief duration of illness) may
      be compromised.

PG  - 128-33
AB  - Pharmacogenetic research into neurotransmitter-related genes is helping to
      unravel genetic factors that determine antipsychotic response. Several genetic
      mutations in neurotransmitter receptors targeted by antipsychotic drugs have been
      found to be related to clinical response. Modern molecular genetic techniques
      will facilitate the identification of those mutations that determine treatment
      response. Future psychiatric prescription will include the genetic
      characterization of neurotransmitter receptors for the selection of the most
      beneficial drug according to the individual's pharmacogenetic profile.

TI  - Influence of methodology on outcomes of randomised clozapine trials.
PG  - 54-9
AB  - The aim of this study was to clarify the impact of various methodological quality
      factors on reported outcome of randomised clozapine trials. Trials comparing the 
      atypical antipsychotic clozapine with other antipsychotic drugs were identified
      in extensive electronic searches. Two independent reviewers extracted data on
      methodology and primary outcomes, and assessed trial quality by use of three sets
      of criteria (Cochrane, Delphi, and Jadad). There was no association between trial
      quality, as measured by any of the criteria sets, and primary measures of
      outcome. Trials with the best score for randomisation and concealment according
      to the Delphi scale had a significantly lower relative risk for relapse in
      clozapine-treated groups, and studies with well reported random order generation 
      according to Jadad criteria tended to have better odds ratios for clinical
      improvement on clozapine. These findings strengthen the evidence of true
      clozapine superiority in these aspects. No other quality items correlated to the 
      primary outcomes. Inadequate randomisation techniques may be a source of bias in 
      clozapine studies, but much more research is needed on the connections between
      trial quality and trial outcome.

TI  - The newer, 'atypical' antipsychotic drugs--their development and current
      therapeutic use.
PG  - 745-9
AB  - General practitioners (GPs) need to become more aware of a new generation of
      antipsychotic drugs that are 'atypical' in that, unlike traditional neuroleptics,
      they do not cause extrapyramidal side-effects; they may also be more effective
      against both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia by their actions
      on various neurotransmitter pathways in the brain. This is a non-systematic
      review of the development of these new drugs and outlines how they are currently 
      being used. It includes information found from an electronic search of the
      databases MEDLINE (from 1966 to June 1998) and EMBASE (from 1980 to January 1998)
      using the combined search terms 'antipsychotic agents', 'atypical', and
      'schizophrenia'.

TI  - Eicosapentaenoic acid treatment in schizophrenia associated with symptom
      remission, normalisation of blood fatty acids, reduced neuronal membrane
      phospholipid turnover and structural brain changes.
PG  - 57-63
AB  - The administration of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to a
      drug-naive patient with schizophrenia, untreated with conventional antipsychotic 
      medication, led to a dramatic and sustained clinical improvement in both positive
      and negative symptoms. This was accompanied by a correction in erythrocyte
      membranes of abnormalities in both n-3 and n-6 highly unsaturated fatty acids and
      with reduced neuronal membrane phospholipid turnover, as evidenced by serial
      31-phosphorus cerebral magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Using recently developed 
      techniques of image segmentation, subvoxel registration and quantitation,
      analysis of serial high-resolution 3D cerebral MRI scans showed that, in the year
      before EPA treatment, cerebral atrophy was taking place and that this atrophy was
      reversed by six months of EPA treatment. These results demonstrate that EPA can
      reverse both the phospholipid abnormalities previously described in schizophrenia
      and cerebral atrophy. They provide strong further evidence in support of the
      membrane phospholipid model of schizophrenia.

TI  - Impaired prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle in schizophrenia.
PG  - 662-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenics show deficits in sensorimotor gating, as measured by
      prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle (PPI). The goal of this investigation is 
      to further characterize PPI and habituation deficits in schizophrenia, and to
      examine whether differing subgroups of schizophrenics would show comparable PPI
      deficits. METHODS: PPI was measured in 24 male schizophrenic subjects (9 acutely 
      decompensated inpatients and 15 stable outpatients) and in 20 age-matched normal 
      control subjects. Schizophrenic subjects were rated for positive and negative
      symptoms at the time of testing. RESULTS: Schizophrenic subjects showed deficits 
      in prepulse inhibition and habituation as compared to normal subjects. Similar
      latency facilitation was produced by the prepulse in both groups. Acutely
      decompensated inpatients and stable outpatients did not differ in percent PPI.
      PPI did not correlate with severity of positive or negative symptoms.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that schizophrenic subjects have impaired
      central inhibitory mechanisms as measured by PPI, and support the hypothesis that
      periods of relative clinical remission are not accompanied by normalization of
      sensorimotor gating.

TI  - Relationship between dopamine D(2) occupancy, clinical response, and side
      effects: a double-blind PET study of first-episode schizophrenia.
PG  - 514-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since all antipsychotics block dopamine D(2) receptors, the authors
      investigated how well D(2) receptor occupancy in vivo predicts clinical response,
      extrapyramidal side effects, and hyperprolactinemia. METHOD: In a double-blind
      study, 22 patients with first-episode schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 1.0
      or 2. 5 mg/day of haloperidol. After 2 weeks of treatment, D(2) receptor
      occupancy was determined with [(11)C]raclopride and positron emission tomography,
      and clinical response, extrapyramidal side effects, and prolactin levels were
      measured. Patients who showed adequate responses continued taking their initial
      doses, those who did not respond had their doses increased to 5.0 mg/day, and
      evaluations were repeated at 4 weeks for all patients. RESULTS: The patients
      showed a wide range of D(2) occupancy (38%-87%). The degree of receptor occupancy
      predicted clinical improvement, hyperprolactinemia, and extrapyramidal side
      effects. The likelihood of clinical response, hyperprolactinemia, and
      extrapyramidal side effects increased significantly as D(2) occupancy exceeded
      65%, 72%, and 78%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that D(2)
      occupancy is an important mediator of response and side effects in antipsychotic 
      treatment. The data are consistent with a "target and trigger" hypothesis of
      antipsychotic action, i.e., that the D(2) receptor specificity of antipsychotics 
      permits them to target discrete neurons and that their antagonist properties
      trigger within those neurons intracellular changes that ultimately beget
      antipsychotic response. While limited to haloperidol, the relationship between
      D(2) occupancy and side effects in this study helps explain many of the observed 
      clinical differences between typical and atypical antipsychotics.

TI  - Management of negative symptoms among patients with schizophrenia attending
      multiple-family groups.
PG  - 513-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Outcomes for negative symptoms over a one-year period were examined in
      two groups of patients, one receiving psychoeducational multiple-family group
      treatment and one receiving standard care. METHODS: A total of 63 outpatients,
      ages 18 to 45 years, with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenic disorders were
      randomly assigned to standard care or multiple-family group psychoeducation
      treatment at a large mental health center in Spokane, Washington. Treatment
      assignment was stratified by whether patients were taking typical or atypical
      antipsychotic medications. Negative symptom status was monitored monthly for one 
      year by raters blind to group assignment and measured as a composite of five
      symptoms using the Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms.
      RESULTS: When the analysis controlled for baseline negative symptoms,
      participants in the multiple-family group experienced significantly reduced
      negative symptoms compared with those receiving standard care. Taking atypical
      antipsychotic medication or having a diagnosis of substance abuse was not
      associated with the severity of negative symptoms. An additional analysis of the 
      five individual negative symptoms indicated small but consistent group
      differences on all dimensions except inattention. Negative symptoms were
      significantly correlated with relapse to acute illness but not with outpatient or
      inpatient service use. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that a
      psychoeducational multiple-family group intervention was more effective than
      standard care in managing negative symptoms over a 12-month period. The results
      are particularly relevant because negative symptoms are associated with relapse, 
      poor social and occupational functioning, cognitive impairment, and lower
      subjective quality of life.

TI  - A multicentre, double-blind, randomized comparison of quetiapine (ICI 204,636,
      'Seroquel') and haloperidol in schizophrenia.
PG  - 95-105
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quetiapine (ICI 204,636, 'Seroquel') is a new atypical antipsychotic 
      agent with a similar binding profile to the original atypical antipsychotic,
      clozapine. Its clinical efficacy has already been demonstrated at multiple fixed 
      doses (150-750 mg/day) and has been suggested to be comparable with haloperidol
      (12 mg/day). METHODS: This international, 6-week, multicentre, double-blind,
      randomized, parallel-group trial compared quetiapine with haloperidol (455 mg and
      8 mg mean total daily doses, respectively) in 448 hospitalized patients with
      acute exacerbation of chronic or subchronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R), in order
      to establish their equivalence in terms of efficacy, and the nature of their
      tolerability profiles, especially in terms of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and
      serum prolactin levels. RESULTS: Both quetiapine and haloperidol produced a clear
      reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and Clinical
      Global Impression (CGI) Severity of Illness and Global Improvement scores. At day
      42, the PANSS total score was reduced by -18.7+/-1.63 in the quetiapine group,
      and -22.1+/-1.63 in the haloperidol group (P = 0.13, between-treatment).
      Quetiapine was better tolerated than haloperidol in terms of EPS as demonstrated 
      by the significant differences in the Simpson Scale and Abnormal Involuntary
      Movement Scale scores (P < 0.05). Although patients in both groups had elevated
      serum prolactin concentrations at baseline, mean serum prolactin concentration
      decreased (by 16.5 microg/l) in quetiapine-treated patients, yet increased (by
      5.9 microg/l) in patients treated with haloperidol. CONCLUSION: Quetiapine is an 
      effective and well tolerated antipsychotic of comparable efficacy to haloperidol 
      and lacks the latter compound's effect on prolactin and EPS.

TI  - Mexiletine in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder.
PG  - 249-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
      mexiletine, a medication with antiarrhythmic, anticonvulsant and analgesic
      properties, in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder patients. METHODS: Twenty
      subjects with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder who had failed to respond or were
      intolerant to lithium, valproic acid and carbamazepine were entered into the
      6-week, open label study. Subjects were followed on a weekly basis for dosing of 
      mexiletine, blood levels, and completion of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 
      (HAM-D) and the Manic State Rating Scale (MSRS). "Burden of Mood Symptoms" (BMS) 
      was calculated by combining scores for the HAM-D and MSRS. RESULTS: Thirteen
      subjects (10 female, 3 male), mean age 41 years (S.D.=7.6), and mean duration of 
      illness 20 years (S.D.=7.7) completed the study. The dose range of mexiletine was
      200-1200 mg/day. Full response (>/=50% reduction in BMS) was seen in 46% of the
      subjects, and a partial response (25-49% reduction in BMS) in 15%. Of note, 5/5
      subjects with a mixed or manic state demonstrated a full or partial response.
      LIMITATIONS: This study has an open label design, and a small number of subjects.
      CONCLUSIONS: Mexiletine may be effective and safe in patients with highly
      treatment-resistant, chronic bipolar disorder. Randomized, controlled trials are 
      required to confirm the current results.

TI  - Effects of atypical antipsychotics on the inflammatory response system in
      schizophrenic patients resistant to treatment with typical neuroleptics.
PG  - 119-24
AB  - There is now some evidence that schizophrenia may be accompanied by an activation
      of the inflammatory response system (IRS) and that typical antipsychotics may
      suppress some signs of IRS activation in that illness. This study was carried out
      to examine (i) the serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-6 receptor
      (IL-6R), IL-1R antagonist (IL-1RA) and Clara Cell protein (CC16), an endogenous
      anticytokine, in nonresponders to treatment with typical neuroleptics and (ii)
      the effects of atypical antipsychotics on the above IRS variables. The above
      parameters were determined in 17 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia 
      (TRS) to treatment with neuroleptics and in seven normal volunteers and 14
      schizophrenic patients who had a good response to treatment with antipsychotic
      agents. Patients with TRS had repeated measurements of the IRS variables before
      and 2 and 4 months after treatment with atypical antipsychotics. Serum IL-6 was
      significantly higher in schizophrenic patients, irrespective of their response to
      typical antipsychotics, than in normal controls. Serum IL-1RA was significantly
      higher in the TRS patients than in controls, whereas responders took up an
      intermediate position. The serum concentrations of CC16 were significantly lower 
      after treatment with atypical antipsychotics during 4 months than before
      treatment. It is concluded that (i) schizophrenia and, in particular, TRS is
      characterized by an activation of the monocytic arm of cell-mediated immunity and
      (ii) atypical antipsychotics may decrease the anti-inflammatory capacity of the
      serum in TRS patients.

TI  - Executive functioning and verbal memory in young patients with unipolar
      depression and schizophrenia.
PG  - 171-87
AB  - Although neuropsychological studies have consistently reported executive deficits
      in schizophrenia, studies of executive functions in depression have produced
      equivocal results. The aim of this study was to examine the profile and the
      specificity of the executive impairment and its association with memory
      performance in young patients with unipolar depression. We compared patients with
      depression to normal control subjects and schizophrenics. Twenty young inpatients
      with unipolar depression, 14 schizophrenics and 20 age-, education- and
      IQ-matched control subjects were assessed with a neuropsychological battery
      including: (1) verbal memory task; (2) frontal tasks (WCST, Cognitive Estimate,
      Verbal fluency, verbal and visuo-spatial span) and a new complex sorting test
      (Delis test). Depressed patients and schizophrenics exhibited executive deficits.
      Unlike schizophrenics, depressed patients did not show memory impairment.
      Deficits in several 'higher-level' functions combined to produce executive
      impairments in patients with depression including complex integration for concept
      formation, spontaneous cognitive flexibility and initiation ability. Impaired
      functions in schizophrenia and in depressed patients were similar but were
      differently related to clinical variables. The pattern of memory failure in our
      schizophrenics is believed to reflect retrieval and encoding deficits. Our
      findings highlight the heterogeneity of skills grouped under the term 'executive 
      functions' that are vulnerable in depression or schizophrenia.

TI  - Olanzapine increases slow-wave sleep: evidence for blockade of central 5-HT(2C)
      receptors in vivo.
PG  - 468-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study aimed to determine the effects of the atypical
      antipsychotic agent, olanzapine, on the polysomnogram in healthy subjects. We
      predicted that olanzapine, via serotonin(2C) (5-HT(2C)) receptor blockade, would 
      increase slow-wave sleep (SWS). METHODS: We studied the effects of single evening
      doses of olanzapine (5 mg and 10 mg orally) on the polysomnogram of 9 healthy
      male volunteers, using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design.
      RESULTS: Compared to placebo, the 5-mg and 10-mg doses of olanzapine
      significantly increased SWS, sleep continuity measures, and subjective sleep
      quality. In addition, 10 mg of olanzapine suppressed rapid eye movement (REM)
      sleep and increased REM sleep latency. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine (5 mg and 10 mg)
      produced substantial (59.1% and 83.3%) and highly significant dose-related
      increases in SWS in humans probably via blockade of brain 5-HT(2C) receptors.
      5-HT(2C) receptor antagonism may account for some of the therapeutic and adverse 
      effects of olanzapine therapy.

TI  - Extrapyramidal symptoms and oestrogen.
PG  - 130-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate neuroleptic side-effect
      severity in women with psychosis, and to investigate their putative association
      with variations in sex steroids over the menstrual cycle. Based on the oestrogen 
      hypothesis, which postulates a synergistic relationship between oestrogen and
      neuroleptics, it was hypothesized that oestrogen would exacerbate extrapyramidal 
      symptoms. METHOD: Twenty-five psychotic women were assessed using the ESRS and
      blood hormone analysis. Testing was conducted twice, 2 weeks apart, in a
      randomized cross-over design. RESULTS: Contrary to expectation the results
      indicated that high levels of oestrogen reduce hyperkinetic symptoms in women
      with psychosis, and this effect appears to be further potentiated when both
      oestrogen and progesterone are high. CONCLUSION: On the basis of these findings, 
      and receptor studies in animals, it was concluded that oestrogen has different
      effects on dopamine dynamics in the mesolimbic and mesostriatal pathways.

TI  - Dopamine D2 receptor occupancy by olanzapine or risperidone in young patients
      with schizophrenia.
PG  - 33-44
AB  - A crucial characteristic of antipsychotic medication is the occupancy of the
      dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. We assessed striatal DA D2 receptor occupancy by
      olanzapine and risperidone in 36 young patients [31 males, 5 females; mean age
      21.1 years (16-28)] with first episode schizophrenia, using [123I]iodobenzamide
      (IBZM) SPECT. The occupancy of DA D2 receptors was not significantly different
      between olanzapine and risperidone. However, in subgroups of most prescribed
      doses, DA D2 occupancy was higher in the risperidone 4-mg group (79%) compared to
      the olanzapine 15-mg group (62%). [123I]IBZM binding ratios decreased with
      olanzapine dose (r = -0.551; P < 0.01), indicating higher DA D2 receptor
      occupancy with higher olanzapine dose. Akathisia and positive symptoms were
      correlated with [123I]IBZM binding ratio (r = -0.442; P < 0.01; and r = -0.360; P
      < 0.05, respectively). Prolactin (PRL) levels were elevated in the risperidone,
      but not in the olanzapine group, at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels. In
      the olanzapine group, PRL levels were correlated with [123I]IBZM binding ratio (r
      = -0.551; P < 0.01). In conclusion, both olanzapine and risperidone induce a high
      striatal D2 receptor occupancy, dependent on dose and group formation. The lower 
      incidence of prolactin elevation with olanzapine, compared to risperidone, may
      not be attributed to a lower D2 receptor occupancy.

TI  - Combined electroconvulsive-clozapine therapy.
PG  - 14-6
AB  - We reviewed 36 reported psychiatric patients who were treated with a combination 
      of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and clozapine. The indication of the
      ECT-clozapine treatment was resistance to classical antipsychotic agents,
      clozapine, or ECT alone. Sixty-seven percent of the patients benefited from the
      combined treatment. In most of the patients, the combined treatment was safe and 
      well tolerated. Adverse reactions occurred in 16.6% of the patients and included 
      prolonged ECT-induced seizures (one case), supraventricular (one case) and sinus 
      tachycardia, and blood pressure elevation. It seems that combined ECT-clozapine
      treatment is effective and safe. This strategy may be a therapeutic option in
      treatment-resistant patients.

TI  - Atypical antipsychotic agents: a critical review.
PG  - 238-55
AB  - The pharmacology, efficacy, and adverse effects of atypical antipsychotic agents 
      when used to treat schizophrenia and other disorders are reviewed. Atypical
      antipsychotic agents were developed in response to problems with typical agents, 
      including lack of efficacy in some patients, lack of improvement in negative
      symptoms, and troublesome adverse effects, especially extrapyramidal symptoms
      (EPSs) and tardive dyskinesia CTD). Atypical antipsychotics differ from typical
      psychotics in their "limbic-specific" dopamine type 2 (D2)-receptor binding and
      high ratio of serotonin type 2 (5-HT2)-receptor binding to D2 binding. In
      clinical trials in patients with non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia,
      risperidone and olanzapine were superior to placebo for positive and negative
      symptoms. Risperidone and olanzapine were superior to haloperidol on some
      measures. Quetiapine was better than placebo but was not better than typical
      antipsychotics. Head-to-head comparisons of atypical antipsychotics in
      non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia have been inconclusive. Clozapine remains
      the standard agent for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Atypical agents are
      substantially more expensive than their typical antipsychotic counterparts. To
      fully determine the overall efficiency of these drugs, other potential benefits, 
      such as improved quality of life, need to be factored in. Atypical antipsychotics
      are associated with a decreased capacity to cause EPSs, TD, neuroleptic malignant
      syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. Clozapine carries a risk of agranulocytosis;
      the white blood cell count must be monitored. Atypical antipsychotics are
      increasingly being used for indications other than schizophrenia, such as the
      management of aggression, mania, and depression. Atypical antipsychotics are
      often considered first-line agents for treating schizophrenia and are promising
      treatment alternatives for other psychiatric and neurologic conditions.

      response to clozapine and conventional antipsychotic medication in refractory
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 709-19
AB  - This study compared the time course to clinical improvement with clozapine and
      with conventional antipsychotic medications. A double-blind trial compared
      clozapine and haloperidol in patients with schizophrenia who were refractory to
      conventional antipsychotic medication and were hospitalized for 30 to 364 days at
      15 Veteran Affairs medical centers during the year before study entry. Patients
      in the original study were randomly assigned to haloperidol or clozapine and
      followed for 12 months, at maximum tolerable doses. Patients who completed a full
      year of treatment with clozapine (n = 122), or with either haloperidol or another
      conventional antipsychotic medication (n = 123) and who also completed the 9- or 
      12-month assessment were included. Response to treatment was defined as 20
      percent improvement on standard scales of symptoms and quality of life at the
      latter of the 9- or 12-month interviews. More patients assigned to clozapine
      achieved 20 percent improvement in symptoms at each followup. Among patients who 
      did not improve at 6 weeks, 3 months, or 6 months, there were no significant
      differences between clozapine and comparison patients in outcomes at 1 year.
      Among patients who did improve, maintenance of that improvement also did not
      differ between the groups at 1 year on symptom measures. Maintenance of
      improvement in quality of life at 1 year was significantly greater for clozapine 
      patients who had improved at 6 months (p < 0.04). Significant differential
      symptom response to clozapine occurred exclusively during the first 6 weeks of
      treatment.

      However, reviews of this nature may lead to spurious results and should not be
      accepted uncritically. This article, the second in a series on evidence-based
      psychopharmacology, is intended to illustrate the process of critical appraisal
      of a systematic review. In this example, a systematic review of studies comparing
      risperidone with conventional antipsychotics is appraised. Interpretation of the 
      results of the systematic review may be hampered by the way in which studies were
      selected.

TI  - Effective neuroleptic medication removes prepulse inhibition deficits in
      schizophrenia patients.
PG  - 61-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: The magnitude of the startle eyeblink response is reduced if the
      startle eliciting stimulus is shortly preceded by another stimulus. There is
      evidence that schizophrenia patients exhibit impairments in this so-called
      prepulse inhibition. Our study investigated whether prepulse inhibition is
      affected by neuroleptic drug treatment as is suggested by animal research.
      METHODS: Prepulse inhibition was tested in five unmedicated and 20 medicated
      inpatients with schizophrenia, and 12 normal controls. RESULTS: The unmedicated
      schizophrenia patients showed a strong impairment of sensorimotor gating as
      indexed by the absence of prepulse inhibition. By contrast, the medicated
      patients showed a pronounced prepulse inhibition that did not differ from that of
      the normal controls. There was a substantial covariation between the rated
      severity of the positive syndrome and the amount of prepulse inhibition--i.e.,
      the patients whose positive symptoms were rated as more severe showed less
      prepulse inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the impaired
      sensorimotor gating of schizophrenia patients is not a stable vulnerability
      indicator, but may rather be related to the positive syndrome and may be improved
      by treatments with neuroleptic medication.

TI  - Lack of drug interactions between mirtazapine and risperidone in psychiatric
      patients: a pilot study.
PG  - 51-7
AB  - An open-label, non-randomized, pilot study has been performed in inpatients in
      need of treatment with an antipsychotic (risperidone) and an antidepressant
      (mirtazapine) with the objective to preliminarily assess a possible
      pharmacokinetic interaction and the tolerability of this combination. A 1-4-week 
      single drug treatment phase (risperidone 1-3 mg bid or mirtazapine 30 mg nocte)
      was followed by a 2-4-week combined drug treatment phase at unchanged doses.
      Twelve patients were enrolled, nine of whom were treated with risperidone in the 
      single drug phase. Results of plasma level measurements are available for six
      patients and indicate that adding mirtazapine to risperidone does not alter
      steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and its 9-hydroxy metabolite.
      Data from one patient suggest that adding risperidone to mirtazapine does not
      result in clinically relevant changes in plasma concentrations of either
      compound. The combination was well tolerated and no major or relevant adverse
      events were observed. Adding risperidone to mirtazapine probably does not
      necessitate a change of the dosage of either drug, but more extensive
      investigations are needed.

TI  - Pharmacoepidemiology of psychotropic drugs in patients with severe mental
      disorders in Italy. Italian Collaborative Study Group on the Outcome of Severe
      Mental Disorders.
PG  - 685-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of psychotropic drug use in a sample of
      Italian outpatient psychiatric services. METHODS: Drug-utilisation survey
      conducted within the framework of a broader prospective follow-up study with 67
      Italian outpatient psychiatric services. RESULTS: The data concern 2322 patients 
      recruited over a 3-year period. Three-quarters of the cohort were prescribed
      antipsychotic drugs, one-half received benzodiazepines and nearly one-third
      received antidepressants. The trends in drug use from 1994 to 1997 show that for 
      patients with schizophrenia there has been a decrease in the prescription of
      typical neuroleptics: the use of haloperidol passed from 56% to 42.4% and that of
      chlorpromazine dropped from 13.5% to 6.1%; during the same period, an increasing 
      use of the atypical compound risperidone was observed. Among patients suffering
      from unipolar affective psychosis, the prescriptions of tricyclic antidepressants
      (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have not changed in
      time, while the proportion of patients receiving neuroleptic drugs has increased 
      from 41% to 45.2%. In addition, the use of antiepileptic drugs and lithium
      increased, irrespective of diagnosis. Almost 40% of the patients on psychotropic 
      drugs received three or more drugs. Finally, a positive association was found
      between the number of prescribed compounds and the daily dose administered.
      CONCLUSION: These data indicate that in the absence of a rational approach to
      drug use, a symptomatic approach is generally adopted, by which common sense,
      experience, information provided by non-independent agencies and other cultural
      parameters play an important role in the prescription strategy.
      Pharmacoepidemiology should more often consider the use of drugs as a dependent
      variable, to be investigated within the context of other clinical, cultural,
      social and setting-related parameters; this approach would enable a more
      comprehensive assessment of prescribing practices and strategies in routine
      clinical care.

TI  - Dementia in developing countries. A consensus statement from the 10/66 Dementia
      Research Group.
PG  - 14-20
AB  - Less than one-tenth of all population-based research into dementia is directed
      towards the two-thirds or more of cases living in developing parts of the world. 
      The 10/66 Dementia Research Group has been formed to redress this imbalance,
      encouraging active research collaboration between centres in different developing
      countries and between developed and developing countries. The 10/66 group
      consisted initially of researchers attending a symposium on dementia research in 
      developing countries, held at the 1998 Alzheimer's Disease International
      conference. They noted a growing interest in this area, with many active
      researchers and others wishing to start new studies. There was felt to be an
      urgent need for more research: quantifying prevalence and incidence, exploring
      regional variations in international collaborations using harmonized
      methodologies, describing care arrangements for people with dementia, quantifying
      the impact on caregivers and evaluating the effectiveness of any newly
      implemented services. Methodological problems need to be addressed, particularly 
      development of culture- and education-fair dementia diagnostic procedures.
      Good-quality research can generate awareness, pioneer service development and
      influence policy.

TI  - Prevalence and correlates of parkinsonism in an institutionalized population of
      geriatric patients with chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 7-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Geriatric patients with chronic schizophrenia are at increased risk
      for parkinsonism and cognitive impairment, but the relationship between the two
      has been insufficiently studied. OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine the prevalence of
      parkinsonism in a cohort of institutionalized geriatric patients with chronic
      schizophrenia (N=79). (2) To examine the relationship of parkinsonism to
      potentially relevant variables including cognitive functioning, positive and
      negative symptoms, sex, age, age at first hospitalization, psychopharmacological 
      regimen and tardive dyskinesia (TD). METHOD: Tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia
      were rated on a five-point severity scale. Clinically significant parkinsonism
      was defined by the unambiguous presence of at least two of those signs. TD was
      assessed with the Modified Simpson Dyskinesia Scale. Schizophrenic symptoms were 
      rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and cognitive functioning
      with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Consortium to Establish a Registry
      for Alzheimer's Disease battery. RESULTS: The prevalence of parkinsonism was 19% 
      and was significantly higher in women than in men. Age was a significant
      predictor of parkinsonism. Independent of age, bradykinesia was significantly
      correlated with MMSE, fluency and naming. Tremor, rigidity and medication status 
      did not correlate with any cognitive variable assessed. Cognitive measures did
      not differ between subjects meeting and not meeting criteria for clinically
      significant parkinsonism. Rigidity and bradykinesia were significantly correlated
      with negative symptoms but no parkinsonism sign correlated with positive
      symptoms. Twelve subjects received ratings consistent with both TD and
      parkinsonism; however, no parkinsonian variable predicted the co-occurrence of
      TD. CONCLUSIONS: The present correlations suggest potential overlap among the
      neural substrates for bradykinesia, cognitive impairment and negative symptoms;
      however, further research is required to clarify that issue.

TI  - Differential memory span--abnormal lateralization pattern in schizophrenic
      patients and their siblings?
PG  - 303-11
AB  - The recurring digit span test is hypothesized to assess consolidation memory and 
      hypothetically addresses neuropsychological left-temporohippocampal functioning, 
      an area of the brain which is presumed to play a crucial role in schizophrenia.
      The present study applied the recurring digit span memory test and the recurring 
      block span memory test (assumed to be an indicator of right-temporohippocampal
      functioning) to 106 acute schizophrenic patients (DSM-III-R), 49 siblings of
      these patients without DSM-III-R lifetime diagnoses as well as 53 non-related
      control subjects without DSM-III-R lifetime diagnoses. Results of our
      investigation indicate that schizophrenic patients differ from control subjects
      regarding recurring digit span in a reduced number of correct reproductions of
      recurring trials. Since performance of schizophrenic patients was only
      non-significantly different from control subjects regarding recurring block span 
      memory, our findings point to a task-specific memory impairment in schizophrenia 
      and argue against a generalized deficit in this disease. Furthermore, individuals
      at risk for schizophrenia also differed from control subjects concerning the
      recurring digit span memory test but not with regard to the recurring block span 
      test. Therefore we conclude that the reduced cumulative learning curve of verbal 
      material (reduced number of correct reproduction of recurring digit trials) in
      schizophrenic patients and their healthy siblings might represent a marker for
      the liability to schizophrenia and parallels neuroimaging findings concerning
      left-sided temporohippocampal abnormalities in this disease, which presumably
      play a key role in the etiology of schizophrenia.

TI  - Brain event-related potentials (ERPs) in schizophrenia during a word recognition 
      memory task.
PG  - 249-65
AB  - Impairments of recognition memory for words and attenuation of the ERP 'old-new' 
      effect have been found in patients with left medial temporal lobe damage. If left
      temporal lobe dysfunction in schizophrenia involves medial structures (e.g.
      hippocampus), then schizophrenic patients might show similar abnormalities of
      verbal recognition memory. This study recorded ERPs from 30 electrode sites while
      subjects were engaged in a continuous word recognition memory task. Results are
      reported for 24 patients having a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 16) or
      schizoaffective disorder (n = 8) and 19 age-matched healthy controls. Both
      patients and controls showed the expected 'old-new' effect, with greater late
      positivity to correctly recognized old words at posterior sites, and there was
      also no significant difference between groups in P3 amplitude. However, accuracy 
      of word recognition memory was poorer in patients than controls, and patients
      showed markedly smaller N2 amplitude. Reduced amplitudes of N2 and N2-P3 were
      associated with poorer performance, with highest correlations over the left
      inferior parietal (N2) and left medial parietal (N2-P3) region. Moreover,
      patients failed to show significantly greater left than right hemisphere
      amplitude of N2-P3 at posterior sites, which was seen for healthy controls. These
      findings suggest that impaired word recognition in schizophrenia may arise from a
      left lateralized deficit at an early stage of processing, beginning at 200-300 ms
      after word onset.

TI  - CYP2D6 mutations and therapeutic outcome in schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 1057-63
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a relationship exists between the most
      common known cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozyme 2D6 mutations and schizophrenia.
      Because most antipsychotic and antidepressant agents interact with CYP2D6, we
      also investigated clinical outcomes in schizophrenic poor metabolizers (PMs) and 
      extensive metabolizers (EMs). DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: 
      Two psychiatric hospitals and a university-affiliated nonpsychiatric hospital.
      SUBJECTS: Thirty-nine consecutive schizophrenic patients (POP 1), 89
      schizophrenics of French Canadian origin (POP 2), and 384 healthy French
      Canadians (POP 3). INTERVENTION: All study subjects were genotyped for CYP2D6
      mutant alleles. POP 1 patients were evaluated before and after 21 or more days of
      treatment with antipsychotic drugs metabolized at least in part by CYP2D6.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Whole blood was collected to determine CYP2D6
      alleles *1, *3, *4, *5, *6, and *7 using standard restriction fragment length
      polymorphisms and polymerase chain reaction techniques. In comparison, CYP2D6
      genotypes were determined in POP 2 and POP 3. Twenty-three (59.0%) of 39 patients
      in POP 1 were genotypically EM homozygotes, 15 (38.4%) were EM heterozygotes, and
      1 (2.6%) was a PM. Similar genotype distributions were determined in POP 2 and in
      POP 3. Genotype distributions for all three populations were in Hardy-Weinberg
      equilibrium (p>0.05), and there was no significant difference among them
      (p=0.857). In POP 1, no differences were seen among genotypes in disease symptom 
      severity, number and severity of adverse drug effects, or attitudes toward drug
      treatment at baseline and at the end of the study. In fact, all patients improved
      significantly during their hospital stay (all p<0.05), although independent of
      the CYP2D6 genotype. CONCLUSION: Common CYP2D6 mutant alleles were not associated
      with schizophrenia or with disease symptoms, antipsychotic-related adverse
      effects, or attitudes toward treatment.

TI  - Effect of caffeine on clozapine pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 59-63
AB  - AIMS: To assess the effects of caffeine on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine in
      healthy volunteers. METHODS: This was an open label randomized crossover study in
      12 nonsmoking healthy male volunteers. The subjects received a single oral dose
      of 12.5 mg clozapine in each phase with or without concomitant intake of caffeine
      (mean dose: 550 mg day-1, range: 400-1000 mg day-1 ). Serum concentrations of
      clozapine and its metabolites desmethyl-clozapine and clozapine-N-oxide were
      measured during a 48 h period in each phase. In addition, serum concentrations of
      caffeine and the metabolite paraxanthine were monitored. RESULTS: A 19% increase 
      in mean clozapine AUC(0,infinity) (P=0.05) and a 14% decrease of mean oral
      clearance of clozapine were observed during concomitant intake of caffeine
      (P=0.05) compared with intake of only clozapine. Statistically significant
      decreases of mean ratios between AUC(0, 12h) for desmethyl-clozapine and
      AUC(0,12h) for clozapine (-18%), and between AUC(0,12h) for clozapine-N-oxide and
      AUC(0,12h) for clozapine (-23%) were observed during the caffeine phase (P=0.03
      and 0.02, respectively). Oral clearance of clozapine and the ratio AUC(0, 12h)
      for desmethyl-clozapine/AUC(0,12h) for clozapine were correlated with the
      paraxanthine/caffeine ratio in serum after intake of caffeine (rs=0.62; P=0.03
      and rs=0.77; P=0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that
      caffeine in daily doses of 400-1000 mg inhibits the metabolism of clozapine to an
      extent that might be clinically significant in certain individuals.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic analysis of felodipine-grapefruit juice interaction based on an
      irreversible enzyme inhibition model.
PG  - 49-58
AB  - Aims Ingestion of grapefruit juice (GFJ) alters the pharmacokinetics of various
      orally administered drugs. Quantitative evaluation of this GFJ-drug interaction
      is required for the proper clinical management of patients. Methods Using
      felodipine as a model drug, we constructed a pharmacokinetic model based on
      irreversible inhibition of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by GFJ. We
      fitted previously published data [5, 6] for felodipine ER (extended release
      formulation) to the ratio of CLGI,int before and after grapefruit juice ingestion
      by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis to estimate the reaction rate
      constant between GFJ and CYP3A4 (K) and the elimination rate constant of CYP3A4
      (k ). RESULTS: The model gave a turnover rate of CYP3A4 of 0.0849 h-1,
      corresponding to a half-life of 8.16 h, in agreement with reported values. The
      AUC-time profiles of felodipine ER in the case of different amounts and schedules
      of GFJ ingestion were simulated using the parameter values estimated from the
      model. CONCLUSIONS: The modelling leads to the important conclusion that
      GFJ-felodipine interaction increases with increasing frequency and amount of GFJ 
      ingestion, and that an interval of 2-3 days between GFJ intake and felodipine
      administration is necessary if GFJ-felodipine interaction is to be avoided.

TI  - Measuring neuroleptic-induced akathisia by three-channel actometry.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - Three-channel actometry was used to study neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA), a 
      common and often serious disorder in association of traditional neuroleptic
      therapy. The aim was to explore the diagnostic possibilities of actometry in NIA 
      and to examine in detail the motor phenomenology of the disorder in detail. The
      actometers were attached to the ankles and waists of ten patients, suffering from
      NIA, and to ten matched healthy controls. Five of the patients were changed to
      olanzapine treatment, and these patients were re-examined during the no-NIA
      condition. NIA was associated with manyfold movement activity during controlled
      rest (sitting) but not with increased daily overall motor activity. Movement
      frequencies in NIA seemed to be pathognomonic. Actometry is promising for
      investigation and clinical assessment of NIA. Olanzapine proved to be an adequate
      treatment choice for NIA patients.

PG  - 101-4
AB  - This study examined plasma concentrations of olanzapine by sex (20 males and
      seven females) in an 8-week fixed-dose study. Dosing was 12.5 mg/day for the
      first week, then 25 mg/day. Trough plasma concentrations were drawn at weeks 1,
      3, 5 and 8. Women volunteers were found to have significantly higher plasma
      concentrations than men. This difference was first evident at study week 5. Women
      have higher plasma concentrations of olanzapine, possibly due to differences in
      metabolism of the CYP450 isoenzyme system.

TI  - Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy associated with clozapine.
PG  - 1841-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine is effective for resistant schizophrenia. After two sudden 
      deaths in physically well young men soon after starting clozapine, we
      investigated the cardiovascular complications for this drug. METHODS: From
      January, 1993, to March, 1999, 8000 patients started clozapine treatment in
      Australia, and were registered with a mandatory monitoring service. We identified
      cases of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy from voluntary reports to the Australian 
      Adverse Drug Reaction Committee and sought details of the relevant diagnostic
      studies, necropsies that had been done in suspicious cases, or both. FINDINGS: 23
      cases (20 men, three women, mean age 36 years [SD 9]) were identified: 15 of
      myocarditis and eight of cardiomyopathy associated with clozapine treatment. Six 
      patients died. All cases of myocarditis (five deaths) occurred within 3 weeks of 
      starting clozapine. Cardiomyopathy (one death) was diagnosed up to 36 months
      after clozapine was started. Necropsy results showed mainly eosinophilic
      infiltrates with myocytolysis, consistent with an acute drug reaction.
      INTERPRETATION: Clozapine therapy may be associated with potentially fatal
      myocarditis and cardiomyopathy in physically healthy young adults with
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Hospital days in risperidone-treated patients.
PG  - 909-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare inpatient hospital days of a group of "real world"
      schizophrenia-spectrum patients for 3 years prior to and 3 years after
      risperidone initiation. METHOD: This is a retrospective cohort study using a
      mirror-image design of hospital days in 120 patients over a 6-year period.
      Hospital admission and discharge information was obtained from chart review and
      database extraction at 3 outpatient treatment sites. The sample comprised all
      patients attending these clinics who were prescribed risperidone during the first
      year of the drug's release. RESULTS: Patients separated into 3 treatment groups: 
      those who were prescribed risperidone for 3 uninterrupted years (N = 35), those
      who interrupted but resumed risperidone use and were prescribed the drug at 3
      years (N = 8), and those who discontinued risperidone during the 3-year follow-up
      period (N = 77). The group continuing risperidone to 3 years demonstrated a
      significant decrease in hospital days after risperidone treatment, in contrast to
      the other 2 groups. The reduction in inpatient days for the total sample was not 
      statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In this outpatient clinic sample, the 29% 
      of patients who continued on risperidone showed a significant reduction in
      inpatient hospital days, from an average of 17.2 days per year in the 3 years
      before risperidone treatment to an average of 2.1 days per year for the 3 years
      of risperidone treatment.

      schizophrenia.
PG  - 887-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if the inclusion of a placebo control in clinical trials 
      of schizophrenia affects retention rates in the first 35 days of inclusion
      relative to trials that did not have a placebo control. METHOD: This was a
      retrospective study of 8 double-blind clinical trials, 5 of which had a placebo
      control while 3 did not. Using survival analysis, retention rates between the
      placebo-controlled trials (PCTs) and the nonplacebo-controlled trials (NPCTs)
      were compared. Screening and percentage improvement on Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores were compared. RESULTS:
      Significantly more patients were retained in the 35-day period for NPCTs. Also,
      the PCT group had significantly more psychopathology at screening than did the
      NPCT group. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in retention rates between PCTs and NPCTs
      cannot be uniquely attributed to placebo itself.

TI  - D-serine added to clozapine for the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 1822-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: D-Serine is a full agonist at the glycine site on the
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Previous administration of D-serine to
      schizophrenic patients taking nonclozapine antipsychotics improved positive,
      negative, and cognitive symptoms, whereas the partial agonist D-cycloserine
      improved negative symptoms of patients taking conventional antipsychotics but
      worsened symptoms in clozapine-treated patients. To study the difference between 
      full and partial agonists at the NMDA receptor glycine site, the clinical effects
      of adding D-serine to clozapine were assessed. METHOD: In a 6-week double-blind
      trial, 20 schizophrenic patients received placebo or D-serine (30 mg/kg per day) 
      in addition to clozapine. Clinical efficacy, side effects, and serum levels of
      D-serine were determined every other week. RESULTS: The patients exhibited no
      improvement with D-serine, nor did their symptoms worsen, as previously reported 
      with D-cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest either that clozapine may
      have an agonistic effect on the NMDA system or that clozapine-treated patients do
      not respond to D-serine.

TI  - Double-blind study of clozapine dose response in chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 1744-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explored the relative efficacy of three different doses of 
      clozapine. METHOD: Fifty patients who met Kane et al.'s criteria for
      treatment-refractory schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were studied. All 
      subjects were randomly assigned to 100, 300, or 600 mg/day of clozapine for 16
      weeks of double-blind treatment. Forty-eight patients completed this first 16
      weeks. Of the 50 patients, 36 went on to second and third 16-week trials of
      double-blind treatment at the remaining doses. RESULTS: Four subjects (8%)
      responded to the first 16-week condition, and one subject (2%) responded to the
      next 16-week crossover condition. A chi-square comparison of the response rates
      from the three dose groups failed to show a significant effect. An analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) comparison of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Anchored (BPRS-A)
      total change scores from baseline to last observation carried forward showed a
      significant dose effect (600>300>100 mg/day) at 16 weeks of treatment. A
      crossover ANOVA of the BPRS-A total scores from the 48-week study also showed
      that the main effect for dose was highly significant; the 100-mg/day dose gave
      the higher (poorer) values, and the 300- and 600-mg/ day doses gave equal
      (better) values. Gender played a role in clinical response to treatment at 100
      mg/day. CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine treatment at 100 mg/day was less effective than at
      300 or 600 mg/day. At 100 mg/day, women responded better than did men. The 600
      mg/day group had the best results, but an occasional patient required up to 900
      mg/day. Overall response rates were lower than expected.

TI  - Lack of efficacy of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron in the treatment of
      acute neuroleptic-induced akathisia.
PG  - 357-60
AB  - The specific mechanism underlying the apparent involvement of the serotonergic
      (5-HT) system in the pathophysiology of extrapyramidal side-effects, particularly
      neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA), remains unknown. We hypothesized that the
      5-HT3 receptor subtype may play a role in the light of the moderate-to-high
      affinity to this receptor of some of the atypical antipsychotic agents which have
      a low propensity to cause akathisia, as well as our earlier findings with the
      5-HT2/5-HT3 antagonist mianserin. In an open-label pilot study, we administered
      the selective 5-HT3 antagonist granisetron (fixed dose, 2 mg/day) for 4 days to
      10 neuroleptic-treated patients with acute NIA. Three patients discontinued
      granisetron because of a lack of response. The remainder showed no significant
      change in score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale during the trial. NIA symptoms
      remained unchanged or worsened in five patients (71.4%) and improved to a certain
      degree in only two. It seems that the 5-HT3 subtype of serotonergic receptor is
      not involved in the development of NIA, and 5-HT3 antagonists are ineffective in 
      the serotonin-related pharmacotherapy of NIA.

TI  - Olanzapine compared to lithium in mania: a double-blind randomized controlled
      trial.
PG  - 339-43
AB  - Neuroleptics are of established efficacy in mania. Controlled data on the use of 
      olanzapine in mania is however, absent. In this study, 30 patients meeting DSM-IV
      criteria for mania were randomly allocated to receive either olanzapine or
      lithium in a 4 week double-blind randomized controlled design. There were no
      significant outcome differences between the two groups on any of the primary
      outcome measures, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (lithium 28.2; olanzapine
      28.0; P = 0.44); Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale (lithium
      2.75, olanzapine 2.36; P = 0.163) or the Mania Scale (lithium 13.2, olanzapine
      10.2; P = 0.315). Olanzapine was however, significantly superior to lithium on
      the CGI-severity scale at week 4 (lithium 2.83, olanzapine 2.29; P = 0.025).
      Olanzapine did not differ from lithium in terms of treatment emergent
      extrapyramidal side-effects as measured by the Simpson-Angus Scale. Olanzapine
      appears to be at least as effective as lithium in the treatment of mania.

TI  - [Atypical antipsychotic profiles of sigma receptor ligands].
PG  - 13-23
AB  - This is a review on the recent results of research on sigma-receptor antagonists.
      NE-100, a selective sigma1-receptor antagonist, shows improvement of abnormal
      behaviors and cognitive dysfunction induced by phencyclidine (PCP). However,
      NE-100 does not inhibit dopamine agonist-induced behaviors nor induces catalepsy.
      The mode of action of NE-100 is estimated to be the indirect modulation of the
      NMDA/PCP-receptor ion channel complex and the modulation of dopamine release from
      the dopaminergic nerve terminals. The recently reported MS-355/MS-377, which is
      also a selective sigma1-receptor antagonist, has a similar pharmacological
      profiles as NE-100, but in addition, MS-355/MS-377 inhibits
      methamphetamine-induced formation of reversal tolerance and also inhibits
      apomorphine-induced climbing behavior like dopamine D2-receptor antagonists. The 
      report on clinical trial targeting schizophrenia shows results on rimcazole,
      remoxipride, BMY 14802, panamesine (EMD 57445) and SL 82.0715. Rimcazole was
      effective in the open study, but the double blind trial was discontinued due to
      seizure induction. Remoxipride showed efficacy different from those of dopamine
      D2-receptor antagonists (less extrapyramidal adverse effects), but the trial was 
      discontinued due to occurrence of aplastic anemia. Panamesine and SL 82.0714
      showed favorable efficacy in the open studies, but BMY 14802 showed no efficacy
      in clinical trials.

TI  - Differences in frontal cortical activation by a working memory task after
      substitution of risperidone for typical antipsychotic drugs in patients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 13432-7
AB  - Antipsychotic drug treatment of schizophrenia may be complicated by side effects 
      of widespread dopaminergic antagonism, including exacerbation of negative and
      cognitive symptoms due to frontal cortical hypodopaminergia. Atypical
      antipsychotics have been shown to enhance frontal dopaminergic activity in animal
      models. We predicted that substitution of risperidone for typical antipsychotic
      drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia would be associated with enhanced
      functional activation of frontal cortex. We measured cerebral blood oxygenation
      changes during periodic performance of a verbal working memory task, using
      functional MRI, on two occasions (baseline and 6 weeks later) in two cohorts of
      schizophrenic patients. One cohort (n = 10) was treated with typical
      antipsychotic drugs throughout the study. Risperidone was substituted for typical
      antipsychotics after baseline assessment in the second cohort (n = 10). A matched
      group of healthy volunteers (n = 10) was also studied on a single occasion. A
      network comprising bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral premotor cortex,
      the supplementary motor area, and posterior parietal cortex was activated by
      working memory task performance in both the patients and comparison subjects. A
      two-way analysis of covariance was used to estimate the effect of substituting
      risperidone for typical antipsychotics on power of functional response in the
      patient group. Substitution of risperidone increased functional activation in
      right prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, and posterior parietal cortex 
      at both voxel and regional levels of analysis. This study provides direct
      evidence for significantly enhanced frontal function in schizophrenic patients
      after substitution of risperidone for typical antipsychotic drugs, and it
      indicates the potential value of functional MRI as a tool for longitudinal
      assessment of psychopharmacological effects on cerebral physiology.

TI  - Rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. An overview of research and clinical experience.
PG  - 585-607
AB  - Although many studies of RCBD have been reported over the last 2 decades,
      knowledge remains limited. Higher incidence in women is the sole clearly
      replicated finding in most studies. This finding might be mediated by
      cyclothymia, a temperament that is of higher prevalence in women and that might
      be considered as a normal variant of RC. Many questions remain unanswered. Review
      of putative risk factors, such as hypothyroidism and treatment with
      antidepressants, provides no conclusive answers. There is clinical evidence to
      implicate both factors. In principle, the thyroid connection can be approached
      rationally, yet there seems to be no relationship between thyroid status and
      response to thyroid augmentation. For this reason and given the potential risks
      of long-term thyroid use, this strategy should not be the first one to be tried
      in RC. Cumulatively, naturalistic studies over the past 30 years have strongly
      implicated antidepressants in switching and cycle acceleration, yet the
      double-blind, controlled, prospective studies that are needed to provide
      definitive answers are unlikely to be conducted for ethical reasons discussed in 
      this article. Bipolar family history of RC probands appears indistinguishable
      from non-RC probands, indicating that most likely RCBD does not breed true.
      Although RC seems to be more lithium resistant with less likelihood of being
      symptom-free after 2 to 5 years of follow-up, many of these patients nonetheless 
      have resolution of the RC course. There is no marked difference in suicide rates.
      An association of RC with bipolar type II, D-M-I pattern and those who switch
      into mania or hypomania on antidepressants is a provocative possibility:
      Antidepressants might introduce RC by first inducing a switch during a depressive
      episode, creating a D-M-I pattern, a pattern that is poorly responsive to
      lithium, which eventually degenerates into RC. Again, this sequence might be
      mediated by the high prevalence of cyclothymia in bipolar II patients. Thus, data
      from phenomenology, family history, and long-term outcome do not support RC as a 
      separate entity. RC appears to be a temporary complicated phase in the illness,
      not a stable feature. This was noted by Kraepelin: I think I am convinced that
      that kind of classification must of necessity wreck on the irregularity of the
      disease. The kind and duration of the attacks and the intervals by no means
      remain the same in the individual case but may frequently change, so that the
      case must be reckoned always to new forms. Data by Gottschalk et al testify to
      the chaotic mood swings of contemporary bipolar disorder. Moreover RC is seen in 
      other medical diseases, such as epilepsy, in which patients have phases of
      increase in frequency of episodes (seizures) that become refractory to treatment.
      Further longitudinal prospective studies are required to understand the
      complexity of this intriguing phenomenon and to provide better treatments.
      Algorithms deriving from tertiary research or university-based clinical
      experience may not generalize to RC or otherwise treatment-resistant bipolar
      patients seen in more routine practice. Illness severity in RCBD generally
      precludes double-blind controlled investigations. Meanwhile, clinicians may rely 
      on discontinuing antidepressants, maintaining patients on combined mood
      stabilizers--of which valproate is probably the most useful--and making judicious
      use of atypical neuroleptics. Benzodiazepines and alcohol (which produce
      withdrawal), caffeine, stimulants, exposure to bright light, and sleep
      deprivation during excited phases should be avoided. Thyroid and nimodipine
      augmentation can be considered in those with the most malignant course. These are
      patients who need the maximal support that their psychiatrist can provide them.
      Office visits must be arranged as the last appointment of the day.

TI  - A comparative effectiveness study of risperidone and olanzapine in the treatment 
      of schizophrenia.
PG  - 658-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risperidone and olanzapine have each been demonstrated to be
      efficacious and safe in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia. To 
      evaluate their relative effectiveness, and to better understand the advantages
      and limitations of each neuroleptic during actual clinical use, we compared one
      directly against the other. METHOD: Forty-two subjects with DSM-IV schizophrenia 
      had received open-label treatment with either risperidone or olanzapine.
      Symptoms, global functioning, and extrapyramidal side effects before and after
      acute treatment were compared within and across groups. At 6-month follow-up, the
      relative effectiveness of these 2 atypical neuroleptics on symptoms and quality
      of life were further evaluated. RESULTS: Following an average of 4 weeks of acute
      treatment, both risperidone and olanzapine were effective in reducing negative,
      psychotic, and disorganized symptoms. Although both neuroleptics were associated 
      with low occurrence of treatment-emergent parkinsonism, risperidone was more
      likely to induce akathisia. The measures for parkinsonism were no different
      across treatment groups, even after taking into account the higher rate of
      anticholinergic use in the risperidone group. Following 6 months of treatment
      with these 2 atypical neuroleptics, there was a significantly greater reduction
      in psychotic symptoms among risperidone-treated subjects. Otherwise, risperidone 
      and olanzapine appear to be equally effective in reducing disorganized and
      negative symptoms and in improving the quality of life. CONCLUSION: Risperidone
      and olanzapine were equally effective as acute treatments. Risperidone was more
      effective for treatment of psychotic symptoms at 6 months, but otherwise the 2
      medications were equally effective in the routine clinical care of patients with 
      schizophrenia. If low (<6 mg/day) doses of risperidone are used, the 2
      medications have comparable rates of parkinsonian side effects.

TI  - [Economic comparison of olanzapine versus haloperidol in treatment of
      schizophrenia in France].
PG  - 281-6
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to provide an economic comparison of
      olanzapine-treated and haloperidol-treated patients from the subset of French
      patients who participated in a large, international, randomised clinical trial in
      schizophrenia. METHODS: Patients were evaluated from randomisation until
      discontinuation, drop out or completion of the 52-week study. The primary
      clinical measure was "clinically important response" (derived from BPRS total
      scores). The secondary measure was "clinically important improvement" (derived
      from CGI severity of illness scores). The primary economic measure was mean per
      diem, per patient total direct medical costs. RESULTS: A total of 275 French
      patients where included in the study. Demographics and other baseline differences
      between olanzapine- and haloperidol-treated patients were not statistically
      significant. Olanzapine-treated patients (205 +/- 142 days) experienced
      significantly (p < 0.001) longer evaluation periods than haloperidol-treated
      patients (132 +/- 129 days). Olanzapine-treated patients (54%) were significantly
      (p = 0.03) more likely to experience a clinically important response than
      haloperidol-treated patients (40%). Olanzapine-treated patients (69%) were
      significantly (p = 0.02) more likely to experience clinically important
      improvement than haloperidol-treated patients (54%). The mean per diem, per
      patient total direct medical cost was statistically lower (p = 0.033) for
      olanzapine-treated patients (FF619 +/- 509) compared to haloperidol-treated
      patients (FF756 +/- 478). CONCLUSION: Olanzapine treatment was associated with
      significantly better clinical outcomes and per diem total direct medical cost
      than haloperidol treatment. The findings indicate that olanzapine is dominant
      compared to haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia, in the context of
      analysed data. These findings produce increased relevance in France to the
      existing evidence supporting olanzapine's cost and effectiveness profiles.

TI  - Clinical and economic outcomes of olanzapine compared with haloperidol for
      schizophrenia. Results from a randomised clinical trial.
PG  - 469-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare, from the payor perspective, 
      the clinical and economic outcomes of olanzapine to those of haloperidol for the 
      treatment of schizophrenia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Clinical, quality-of-life and
      resource utilisation data were prospectively collected for US-residing patients
      with schizophrenia who were participating in a multicentre, randomised,
      double-blind clinical trial comparing olanzapine and haloperidol. Direct medical 
      costs were estimated by assigning standardised prices (1995 values) to the
      resource utilisation data. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: 817 patients with
      schizophrenia who had a baseline Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score (BPRS) > or
      = 18 (items scored 0 to 6) and/or were no longer tolerating current antipsychotic
      therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day (n = 551) or haloperidol 5 to
      20 mg/day (n = 266) for 6 weeks. Patients showing a predefined level of clinical 
      response entered a 46-week maintenance phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: 
      After acute treatment, BPRS-based clinical improvements were seen in 38 and 27%
      of olanzapine and haloperidol patients, respectively (p = 0.002). Clinically
      important improvements on the Quality of Life Scale were achieved during acute
      treatment in 33% of olanzapine recipients and 25% of haloperidol recipients (p = 
      0.094). Olanzapine treatment in the acute phase led to significantly lower
      inpatient ($US5125 vs $US5795, p = 0.038) and outpatient ($US663 vs $US692, p =
      0.001) costs, resulting in a significant overall reduction in mean total medical 
      costs of $US388 (p = 0.033). This significant reduction in total costs was found 
      despite olanzapine mean medication costs being significantly greater than
      haloperidol medication costs ($US326 vs $US15, p < 0.001). No significant
      differences in clinical improvement were observed in the maintenance phase.
      Maintenance phase olanzapine mean total medical costs were $US636 lower than
      haloperidol total costs (p = 0.128). Although olanzapine medication costs were
      significantly higher than haloperidol medication costs ($US3461 vs $US95, p <
      0.001), this difference was offset by significantly lower inpatient ($US8322 vs
      $US10,662, p = 0.044) and outpatient ($US3810 vs $US5473, p = 0.038) costs.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study, olanzapine treatment was more effective than
      haloperidol in producing clinical response in the acute phase. In addition,
      olanzapine treatment led to reductions in inpatient and outpatient costs that
      more than offset olanzapine's higher medication costs relative to haloperidol.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 375-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease afflicts millions of older Americans, with an
      estimated cost to society approaching $100 million annually. Family physicians
      will care for an increasing number of patients with Alzheimer disease as well as 
      their caregivers and families. METHODS: A comprehensive and systematic review of 
      the literature published between 1985 and 1998 about diagnosing and treating
      Alzheimer disease was conducted, using "dementia," "Alzheimer's disease," and
      "treatment" as search strategy key words. Data and information that reported
      significant conclusions were critically reviewed. Potentially important new data 
      about new agents that might be of benefit when caring for patients with Alzheimer
      disease are discussed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The primary goals when treating
      Alzheimer disease patients are enhancing autonomy and functional abilities and
      maintaining quality of life for patients and caregivers. In addition to
      diagnostic and pharmacologic treatment, primary care physicians will be called
      upon to provide nonpharmacologic support to assist with behavioral, social, and
      living environment problems faced by these patients and their families. The most 
      common pharmacologic treatment is cholinesterase inhibition. Two cholinesterase
      inhibitors, tacrine and donepezil, are effective in treating cognitive and global
      function. Newer cholinesterase inhibitors should soon be available that might
      offer safety advantages as well as efficacy in treating behavioral and
      psychiatric symptoms related to Alzheimer disease. Other agents, including
      vitamin E, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogen, and Ginkgo biloba, are
      under investigation. Nonpharmacologic measures are important components in the
      management of Alzheimer disease. Support groups can help to diminish behavioral
      problems, maintain the patient's independence, and provide relief for caregivers 
      and families.

AB  - In a randomized prospective clinical trial with an observation period of 2.5
      years, a subgroup analysis was carried out for the 114 patients with bipolar I
      disorder (DSM-IV) regarding the prophylactic efficacy of lithium and
      carbamazepine. Treatment outcome was evaluated taking rehospitalization,
      recurrence, subclinical recurrence, concomitant medication and severe adverse
      effects into consideration. Special interest was paid to the enzyme-inducing
      properties of carbamazepine, which might lessen the efficacy of psychotropic
      comedication. Lithium was superior to carbamazepine in bipolar I patients for
      various outcome criteria. Analyses in patients without psychotropic comedication 
      indicate that the superiority of lithium is not the result of carbamazepine
      reducing plasma levels of concomitant drugs.

TI  - The brain metabolic patterns of clozapine- and fluphenazine-treated female
      patients with schizophrenia: evidence of a sex effect.
PG  - 632-40
AB  - The regional cerebral glucose metabolic rates of clozapine-treated and
      fluphenazine-treated women with schizophrenia and normal controls were obtained
      by positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
      (FDG) as the tracer. The regional metabolic patterns were compared to each other 
      and to the changes previously observed in men. In women, as in men, both
      clozapine- and fluphenazine-treatment were associated with lower metabolism in
      the superior prefrontal cortex and higher metabolism in the medial temporal lobe.
      In both men and women, clozapine treatment led to a greater lowering of inferior 
      prefrontal cortex activity than fluphenazine, which was statistically significant
      in the larger male cohort. Fluphenazine led to higher metabolic rates in the
      lateral temporal lobe than clozapine did, but the differences between the two
      neuroleptics were not statistically significant in either group. The greatest
      differences in the female as compared to the male responses to fluphenazine and
      clozapine were in the cingulate and striatum. As compared to controls, the
      cingulate metabolic rates of women were reduced by 9.1% and 11.4% on clozapine
      and fluphenazine, respectively; whereas, men have a statistically nonsignificant 
      reduction of 0.1% with clozapine and a 3.2% increase with fluphenazine. In men,
      fluphenazine was associated with a much greater elevation in basal ganglia
      metabolic rates than was clozapine, 23.5% as compared to 3.75%; whereas, in
      women, basal ganglia metabolic rates are nearly equally increased by fluphenazine
      (21.6%) and clozapine (15.1%).

TI  - Olanzapine. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile.
PG  - 177-93
AB  - Multicentre trials in patients with schizophrenia confirm that olanzapine is a
      novel antipsychotic agent with broad efficacy, eliciting a response in both the
      positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Compared with traditional
      antipsychotic agents, olanzapine causes a lower incidence of extrapyramidal
      symptoms and minimal perturbation of prolactin levels. Generally, olanzapine is
      well tolerated. The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are linear and
      dose-proportional within the approved dosage range. Its mean half-life in healthy
      individuals was 33 hours, ranging from 21 to 54 hours. The mean apparent plasma
      clearance was 26 L/h, ranging from 12 to 47 L/h. Smokers and men have a higher
      clearance of olanzapine than women and nonsmokers. After administering
      [14C]olanzapine, approximately 60% of the radioactivity was excreted in urine and
      30% in faeces. Olanzapine is predominantly bound to albumin (90%) and alpha
      1-acid glycoprotein (77%). Olanzapine is metabolised to its 10- and
      4'-N-glucuronides, 4'-N-desmethylolanzapine [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2] and
      olanzapine N-oxide (flavin mono-oxygenase 3). Metabolism to
      2-hydroxymethylolanzapine via CYP2D6 is a minor pathway. The 10-N-glucuronide is 
      the most abundant metabolite, but formation of 4'-N-desmethylolanzapine is
      correlated with the clearance of olanzapine. Olanzapine does not inhibit CYP
      isozymes. No clinically significant metabolic interactions were found between
      olanzapine and diazepam, alcohol (ethanol), imipramine, R/S-warfarin,
      aminophylline, biperiden, lithium or fluoxetine. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of
      CYP1A2, increases plasma concentrations of olanzapine; inducers of CYP1A2,
      including tobacco smoke and carbamazepine, decrease olanzapine concentrations.
      Orthostatic changes were observed when olanzapine and diazepam or alcohol were
      coadministered. Pharmacodynamic interactions occurred between olanzapine and
      alcohol, and olanzapine and imipramine, implying that patients should avoid
      operating hazardous equipment or driving an automobile while experiencing the
      short term effects of the combinations. Individual factors with the largest
      impact on olanzapine pharmacokinetics are gender and smoking status. The plasma
      clearance of olanzapine generally varies over a 4-fold range, but the variability
      in the clearance and concentration of olanzapine does not appear to be associated
      with the severity or duration of adverse effects or the degree of efficacy. Thus,
      dosage adjustments appear unnecessary for these individual factors. However,
      dosage modification should be considered for patients characterised by a
      combination of factors associated with decreased oxidative metabolism, for
      example, debilitated or elderly women who are nonsmokers.

TI  - Psychopharmacology in autism.
PG  - 651-65
AB  - Autism is a neurobiological disorder. The core clinical features of autism
      include impairment in social interaction, impairments in verbal and nonverbal
      communication, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, 
      interests, and activities. Autism often has coexisting neuropsychiatric
      disorders, including seizure disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
      affective disorders, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and
      Tourette disorder. No etiology-based treatment modality has been developed to
      cure individuals with autism. However, comprehensive intervention, including
      parental counseling, behavior modification, special education in a highly
      structured environment, sensory integration training, speech therapy, social
      skill training, and medication, has demonstrated significant treatment effects in
      many individuals with autism. Findings from preliminary studies of major
      neurotransmitters and other neurochemical agents strongly suggest that
      neurochemical factors play a major role in autism. The findings also provide the 
      rationale for psychopharmacotherapy in individuals with autism. This article
      reviews studies of neurochemical systems and related psychopharmacological
      research in autism and related neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical indications
      for pharmacotherapy are described, and uses of various medications are suggested.
      This article also discusses new avenues of investigation that may lead to the
      development of more effective medication treatments in persons with autism.

TI  - Controlled, double-blind investigation of the clozapine discontinuation symptoms 
      with conversion to either olanzapine or placebo. The Collaborative Crossover
      Study Group.
PG  - 435-43
AB  - The abrupt appearance of clozapine discontinuation symptoms represents a
      particularly unique situation that has not been characterized in a double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial. A randomized, double-blind comparison of placebo (N =
      53) and olanzapine 10 mg (N = 53) for 3 to 5 days following the abrupt
      discontinuation of clozapine (< 300 mg/day) was carried out. Subjects were
      assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical
      Global Impression Scale of Severity, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale (MADRS), and the Mini-Mental State Evaluation. Subsequently both groups
      received open-label olanzapine (10-25 mg/day) for an additional 9 weeks.
      Statistically significantly more placebo-treated (24.5%) than olanzapine-treated 
      (7.5%) patients experienced clozapine discontinuation symptoms (p = 0.017). Core 
      symptoms included delusions, hallucinations, hostility, and paranoid reaction and
      translated into a significantly higher worsening from baseline on the PANSS
      total, PANSS General Psychopathology subscale, and MADRS among subjects randomly 
      assigned to receive placebo. After open-label treatment with olanzapine for 9
      weeks, both groups were clinically stable, suggesting that the discontinuation
      symptoms were transient. However, subjects who had been randomly assigned to the 
      3- to 5-day placebo discontinuation segment achieved somewhat less global
      clinical improvement. Although a pharmacologic interpretation is speculative,
      evidence of a clozapine discontinuation syndrome was apparent. In most cases, the
      direct substitution of a pharmacologically similar agent (olanzapine) prevented
      the syndrome. Clozapine discontinuation or noncompliance should be considered in 
      the differential assessment of an acutely emergent psychosis. The possibility
      that subjects who experience a clozapine discontinuation syndrome may take longer
      or are less likely to clinically restabilize warrants further investigation.

TI  - Addition of low-dose fluvoxamine to low-dose clozapine monotherapy in
      schizophrenia: drug monitoring and tolerability data from a prospective clinical 
      trial.
PG  - 148-53
AB  - Combining fluvoxamine and clozapine may be a strategy to improve therapeutic
      effects on negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Fluvoxamine, however,
      markedly inhibits the metabolism of clozapine, and hazardous side effects may
      result. This study prospectively investigated the safety and tolerability of an
      add-on therapy with fluvoxamine to a clozapine monotherapy in schizophrenic
      patients. Sixteen schizophrenic patients received 50 mg fluvoxamine as a
      comedication after having reached steady-state conditions under clozapine
      monotherapy. Patients were monitored for subjective adverse events, laboratory
      parameters, EEG and ECG recordings, orthostatic hypotension and their
      psychopathology. Concomitantly, serum concentrations of clozapine and metabolites
      were measured during monotherapy and after addition of fluvoxamine. In all
      patients, the serum concentrations of clozapine and metabolites were markedly
      increased (average: 2-3 fold, up to 5 fold for clozapine) after addition of
      fluvoxamine. Side effects remained almost unchanged in frequency and severity in 
      spite of the pharmacokinetic interactions. ECG or laboratory parameters and
      orthostatic tests were similar under monotherapy and comedication. Minimal
      increases of EEG abnormalities were observed, but they were not associated with
      clinical impairment. Epileptic activities were always absent. The psychopathology
      improved which continued after start of the comedication. Though the addition of 
      fluvoxamine to clozapine medication was well tolerated and critical side effects 
      were absent, the combined treatment should be controlled by drug monitoring, as
      serum concentrations of clozapine increased to unpredictably high levels. Further
      studies have to find out if the combined treatment could be advantageous to
      clozapine monotherapy.

TI  - Olanzapine for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a naturalistic
      case-series outcome study.
PG  - 701-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective, consecutive case-series outcome investigation
      evaluates the effectiveness of olanzapine in 16 patients with treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. METHOD: Treatment resistance was defined as nonresponsiveness to
      at least 3 antipsychotic drugs from at least 2 different chemical classes. A
      minimum baseline score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) of 45 was
      required for enrolment. Outcome evaluation measures included the BPRS, Global
      Assessment Scale (GAS), and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). RESULTS: 
      Subjects (n = 16) has a mean age of 40 years and mean duration of illness of 16
      years. Olanzapine treatment was initiated at 5 mg daily and was increased based
      on clinical judgement up to a maximum of 40 mg daily. Significant decreases in
      mean BPRS (P < 0.001) and GAS (P < 0.01) scores were observed at weeks 4, 8, 12, 
      and 16, compared with baseline. Eight of 16 patients responded to olanzapine, as 
      defined by a 20% decrease in BPRS score by week 16. Dyskinetic movements
      significantly increased at week 4 (P < 0.01) but did not differ from baseline at 
      weeks 8 and 16. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that olanzapine at moderate to 
      high doses may offer an effective treatment for a significant proportion of
      patients with schizophrenia nonresponsive to multiple trials of conventional
      antipsychotics. A randomized controlled trial is encouraged to validate these
      findings, and comparative trials are required to determine when clinicians should
      consider this approach.

TI  - [Clinical efficacy of olanzapine].
PG  - 101-10
AB  - The treatment of schizophrenic patients who fail adequate trials of typical
      neuroleptics is a major challenge. For these patients, the availability of
      atypical antipsychotics is a useful therapeutic advance. Olanzapine shows a
      superior and broader spectrum of efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia,
      particularly its negative symptoms, with a substantially more favorable safety
      profile than conventional antipsychotic agents (e.g., haloperidol). However,
      little information on the clinical effects of olanzapine is available in Japan.
      This article provides information on the efficacy of olanzapine for various
      symptoms of schizophrenic patients and drug safety. Olanzapine is significantly
      superior to haloperidol in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of
      patients, and for tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms. Significantly
      greater improvement in avolition-apathy is achieved with olanzapine as compared
      to risperidone. These advantages are related to high affinity at the 5-HT2
      binding site, no association with an alteration in dopamine A9 firing rates, and 
      lower D2 striatal receptor blockade of olanzapine. Treatment with 10 mg/day
      olanzapine is more appropriate for positive symptoms, and 12.5-17.5 mg/day
      olanzapine is more effective for negative symptoms. Patients will need help
      adapting to a new level of functioning after a successful switch to olanzapine,
      and overcoming the disappointment that eventually occurs when the limitations of 
      olanzapine become apparent.

TI  - Late-onset schizophrenia: epidemiology, diagnosis, management and outcomes.
PG  - 81-9
AB  - The onset of schizophrenia for the first time in late life has been considered
      rare, and the nosology of the late-onset functional psychoses remains
      contentious. However, it is clear that a significant proportion of individuals
      with a diagnosis of schizophrenia do have the first onset of the illness in late 
      and very late life. The clinical presentation of such patients shows some
      differences from patients with early-onset disease, particularly in having a
      lower prevalence of premorbid dysfunction, negative symptoms and formal thought
      disorder. The longitudinal course is variable, possibly a reflection of
      aetiological heterogeneity. Atypical antipsychotic agents would appear to have
      significant benefits in the treatment of this group of patients, given the
      particular vulnerability of the elderly to extrapyramidal adverse effects,
      notably tardive dyskinesia.

TI  - Risperidone in treatment-refractory schizophrenia.
PG  - 1374-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical safety and
      efficacy of risperidone compared to haloperidol in patients with
      treatment-refractory schizophrenia. METHOD: Sixty-seven medication-unresponsive
      subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with risperidone (N = 34) or
      haloperidol (N = 33). After a 3-7 day-placebo washout period, there was a 4-week,
      double-blind, fixed-dose comparison trial that was followed by a 4-week,
      flexible-dose phase. Measures of clinical change were quantified by standard
      psychopathologic and neuromotor instruments. RESULTS: Risperidone demonstrated
      clinical efficacy superior to that of haloperidol on the total Brief Psychiatric 
      Rating Scale (BPRS) after the first 4 weeks of treatment. Risperidone did not
      show any advantage over haloperidol after an additional 4 weeks. Overall
      improvement on the BPRS at 4 weeks was significantly better for the risperidone
      group (24%) than for the haloperidol group (11%). Risperidone-treated subjects
      were significantly less likely than haloperidol-treated subjects to require
      concomitant anticholinergic medication after 4 weeks (20% versus 63%); they also 
      had significantly les observable akathisia (24% versus 53%) and significantly
      less severe tardive dyskinesia. Baseline characteristics that correlated
      significantly with risperidone response were positive symptoms, conceptual
      disorganization, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone was 
      better tolerated and more effective in a subset of patients with
      treatment-refractory schizophrenia. Positive psychotic symptoms and
      extrapyramidal side effects at baseline appear to be powerful predictors of
      subsequent response to risperidone.

TI  - Olanzapine addition in obsessive-compulsive disorder refractory to selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors: an open-label case series.
PG  - 524-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs) in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, a significant number
      of patients show no or only partial remission of symptoms. Some evidence exists
      to suggest that risperidone augmentation can be helpful in treating this
      refractory group. The efficacy of other atypical antipsychotic agents, such as
      olanzapine, in augmenting SSRIs in refractory obsessive-compulsive patients has
      yet to be systematically investigated. METHOD: A series of 10 patients with
      DSM-IV obsessive-compulsive disorder showing significant residual symptoms
      following an adequate SSRI trial (12 weeks) were given open-label olanzapine
      augmentation for a minimum of an additional 8 weeks. Treatment response was
      assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and the Clinical Global 
      Impressions scale. RESULTS: Nine of the 10 patients in this series treated with
      olanzapine and an SSRI completed the 8-week augmentation trial. Of these, 4
      demonstrated a complete remission or major improvement in obsessive-compulsive
      symptoms, 3 had partial remission, and 2 experienced no benefit. Nine patients
      experienced minimal adverse effects, primarily sedation, which did not interfere 
      with continuing treatment. One patient discontinued olanzapine owing to excessive
      sedation. CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary, open-label trial suggest
      that olanzapine may be effective in augmenting ongoing SSRI treatment for a
      portion of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder refractory to SSRI
      treatment. Larger, placebo-controlled trials appear warranted to investigate the 
      clinical efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine augmentation of SSRI treatment
      in SSRI-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.

TI  - Elevated frequency of diabetes mellitus in hospitalized manic-depressive
      patients.
PG  - 1417-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Disturbance in glucose homeostasis in psychiatric populations has been
      suggested since the early part of this century. Increased comorbidity of diabetes
      mellitus in persons with major mood disorders has also been suggested. The goal
      of this study was to determine whether subjects diagnosed with bipolar disorder
      have an elevated rate of comorbid diabetes mellitus. METHOD: Three hundred
      forty-five hospitalized patients, aged 20-74 years, who met the DSM-III-R
      criteria for bipolar disorder, manic or mixed subtype, were evaluated for a
      comorbid diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The frequency of diabetes mellitus in
      the study group was determined and compared with the expected frequency,
      calculated as a weighted average based on sex and age from national norms.
      Variables characterizing the course and severity of the affective disorder in the
      group of diabetic bipolar subjects and a group of nondiabetic age-matched bipolar
      subjects were compared. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus among these 
      bipolar patients was 9.9%, significantly greater than expected from national
      norms (3.4%). The patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus had significantly more
      lifetime psychiatric hospitalizations than the nondiabetic subjects, but age at
      first hospitalization and duration of psychiatric disorder were similar in the
      two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of diabetes mellitus in hospitalized
      patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder is higher than in the general
      population. Manic-depressive patients with diabetes mellitus have a more severe
      course of illness, as indicated by a greater number of psychiatric
      hospitalizations. Possible reasons for this increased comorbidity include a
      genetic relationship between the disorders, a causal relationship in which
      hypercortisolemia induces diabetes or diabetic vascular lesions contribute to
      mania, an overlapping functional disturbance affecting similar regions of the
      brain, or the effect of psychotropic medications.

TI  - Effects of clozapine on awareness of illness and cognition in schizophrenia.
PG  - 239-49
AB  - Awareness of illness is a crucial factor in schizophrenia, both for clinical
      management and psychopathological modeling. To date, there has been relatively
      little investigation of the influence of treatment with conventional versus
      atypical neuroleptics in relation to awareness and cognitive functions. The
      effect of clozapine treatment, compared with conventional neuroleptics, was
      studied in 22 schizophrenic patients in a crossover study. The P300 component of 
      the event-related potential and scores on the Scale for Unawareness of Mental
      Disorder (SUMD), the Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale (EPS), and Andreasen's
      Scales for the Assessment of Positive (SAPS) and Negative Symptoms (SANS) were
      studied at time 1 (conventional neuroleptic treatment) and time 2 (after 6 months
      of treatment with clozapine, in patients who interrupted the previous
      conventional regimen). Significantly increased P300 amplitudes were associated
      with clozapine treatment, together with heightened insight and reduced
      involuntary movements. The results confirm the effectiveness of clozapine not
      only in enhancing neurocognitive function, but also in increasing awareness of
      illness in schizophrenic patients.

TI  - Experience with the atypical antipsychotics--risperidone and olanzapine in the
      elderly.
PG  - 113-8
AB  - There is paucity of published data regarding controlled trials with risperidone
      and olanzapine in elderly psychotic patients. Medical records of 151 hospitalized
      geropsychiatric patients (risperidone patients n = 114 and olanzapine patients n 
      = 37) were analyzed for demographic data, target symptoms, doses, effects, side
      effects, comorbid medical conditions and concurrent medications. The mean age of 
      the patients was 71 years. The male: female ratio was essentially the same for
      both groups. The mean daily dose was 3 mg for risperidone and 10 mg for
      olanzapine. 78% of the risperidone group and 75% of the olanzapine group appear
      to have responded to treatment. The discontinuation rates of medication was the
      same in both groups (22%). Adverse events were reported in 16-17% in both groups.
      It appears from this study that both risperidone and olanzapine are relatively
      safe and effective in geropsychiatric patients with comorbid medical illnesses.
      Controlled studies and head-to-head comparison studies are recommended.

TI  - Safety of amisulpride (Solian): a review of 11 clinical studies.
PG  - 209-18
AB  - We assessed the overall safety profile of amisulpride based on the results from
      11 clinical studies performed in patients suffering from schizophrenia with
      predominance of positive or negative symptoms. A total of 1933 patients were
      randomly assigned to treatment with amisulpride (n = 1247) or haloperidol (n =
      309), risperidone (n = 113), flupentixol (n = 62) and placebo (n = 202). Safety
      data collection was performed using open reporting, UKU scales or specific
      extrapyramidal side-effect scales; electrocardiogram recording and vital signs
      examination; laboratory data collection. Amisulpride demonstrated a satisfactory 
      global safety profile in the range of doses usually prescribed. The number of
      patients having at least one extrapyramidal side-effect was higher in haloperidol
      patients compared with both amisulpride and risperidone patients (50% versus 30% 
      in the two latter groups). For endocrine events, a similar rate was observed
      between amisulpride and risperidone groups (4% versus 6%, respectively) versus 1%
      in the haloperidol group. Electrocardiogram results were satisfactory, confirmed 
      by the absence of cardiovascular events. The overall laboratory safety profile of
      amisulpride did not show clinically relevant abnormalities in liver function
      tests nor haematological abnormalities. Our extensive clinical data confirm the
      satisfactory safety profile of amisulpride which is superior to standard
      reference compounds.

TI  - [Early phase II study of quetiapine fumarate on schizophrenia].
PG  - 53-66
AB  - The efficacy and safety of quetiapine fumurate in the treatment of patients with 
      schizophrenia were evaluated in an 8-week, multicenter, open-label study. The
      results of this study which included a total of 54 patients showed good efficacy 
      and safety profile for quetiapine fumarate as seen by the improvement rate
      (moderate or above in the final global improvement rating) of 49.1% and safety
      rate (no problem in overall safety rating) of 66.0%. The mean BPRS total score
      decreased significantly from 55.5 +/- 10.9 points at baseline to 45.4 +/- 13.0
      points at the completion of administration. The PANSS scores also showed
      significant improvement on all scales; the mean scores decreased from 20.7 +/-
      6.3 points at baseline to 17.7 +/- 6.9 points at withdrawal or completion of
      administration on the positive scale, from 27.8 +/- 5.8 points to 24.0 +/- 7.3
      points on the negative scale, and from 51.4 +/- 10.1 points to 44.7 +/- 12.4
      points on the general psychopathology scale. Although the most frequent adverse
      reactions were somnolence (18.9%), insomnia (17.0%), nervousness (13.2%),
      dizziness (13.2%), malaise (13.2%), postural hypotension (11.3%), tachycardia
      (9.4%), and constipation (9.4%), the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was low
      (11.3%). From these results, quetiapine fumarate was suggested to be highly
      effective and safe for the treatment of schizophrenia.

TI  - Clozapine reduces severe self-mutilation and aggression in psychotic patients
      with borderline personality disorder.
PG  - 477-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine has been reported to be effective in diminishing violence
      toward others in psychotic patients. This article describes the impact of
      clozapine on severe self-mutilation among patients with the dual diagnoses of
      borderline personality disorder and persistent psychoses. METHOD: Seven subjects 
      known to the authors were selected for careful chart audits. These subjects had
      been admitted to 2 state psychiatric hospitals owing to severe self-mutilation
      and/or violence and subsequently treated with clozapine. A mirror-image design
      anchored to the start date of clozapine treatment and extending in either
      direction to a maximum of 1 year was used to extract data. Data extracted
      included incidents of self-mutilation (restraint), seclusion, the as and when
      needed (p.r.n.) use of medications, injuries to staff and peers, hospital
      privileges, and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores. RESULTS: The
      subjects were all white women with a mean age of 37 years. All subjects carried
      DSM-III-R or DSM-IV borderline personality disorder diagnoses and an Axis I
      disorder diagnosis. They had received trials of several psychotropic agents,
      often in combination and mostly without benefit. After clozapine treatment, there
      were statistically significant reductions in incidents of self-mutilation
      (restraint), seclusion, the use of p.r.n. antianxiety medications, and injuries
      to staff and peers. These subjects received higher levels of hospital privileges,
      and their GAF scores nearly doubled following clozapine treatment. Four subjects 
      were subsequently discharged from hospital. CONCLUSION: These preliminary but
      nonetheless favorable results suggest that clozapine deserves careful
      consideration for a controlled study in patients with borderline personality
      disorder and psychoses, especially if the clinical issues include severe
      self-mutilation, aggression, and violence. Until such studies are done, the
      risk-to-benefit ratio of clozapine treatment needs to be carefully evaluated on
      an individualized basis in such subjects.

TI  - Clinical outcome in a randomized 1-year trial of clozapine versus treatment as
      usual for patients with treatment-resistant illness and a history of mania.
PG  - 1164-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Case series and follow-up studies suggest that clozapine may have
      mood-stabilizing properties in addition to antipsychotic action in patients with 
      schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and bipolar I disorder, but the
      generalizability of these findings is limited. This article describes a
      randomized, open study of clozapine add-on therapy versus treatment as usual for 
      patients with treatment-resistant illness and a history of mania. METHOD:
      Thirty-eight patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective or bipolar 
      disorder that was deemed treatment-resistant were randomly assigned to clozapine 
      add-on treatment (N = 19) or treatment as usual (no clozapine) (N = 19) and
      followed up for 1 year. Patients received monthly ratings on the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression scale, Bech-Rafaelsen Mania 
      Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Scale for the Assessment of Positive
      Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Abnormal Involuntary
      Movement Scale, and a 40-item side effect checklist. Differences between
      treatment groups were assessed according to a pattern-mix random-regression
      model. An additional analysis compared group differences in rating scale scores
      against relative time in the study. RESULTS: Significant between-group
      differences were found in scores on all rating scales except the Hamilton
      depression scale. Total medication use over 1 year significantly decreased in the
      clozapine group. No significant differences between groups in somatic complaints 
      were noted. The subjects with nonpsychotic bipolar I disorder who received
      clozapine showed a degree of improvement similar to that of the entire
      clozapine-treated group. Clozapine dose was significantly higher for the patients
      with schizoaffective illness than for those with bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS:
      The results of this study support clozapine's independent mood-stabilizing
      property. They demonstrate that clozapine use was associated with significant
      clinical improvement relative to treatment as usual.

      Double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 238-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serotonin (5-HT):dopamine imbalance may underlie neuroleptic-induced 
      akathisia. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of the 5-HT2 antagonist, mianserin in
      neuroleptic-induced akathisia. METHODS: Thirty neuroleptic-treated patients with 
      schizophrenia were randomly allocated in a double-blind design to receive either 
      mianserin (15 mg/day) or placebo for five days. Patients were assessed at
      baseline and on Days 3 and 5 by the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BARS), as well as by 
      other relevant clinical rating scales. RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group, 
      the mianserin-treated patients showed a significant reduction in all four BARS
      subscales by Day 5, with mean reductions in the BARS global score of 9.9% and
      52.2%, respectively (P = 0.006). Response to treatment (a reduction of at least
      two points on the BARS global subscale), was noted in six patients (40%) in the
      mianserin group and only one patient (9.1%) in the placebo group (P = 0.04, log
      odds ratio 2.23). CONCLUSIONS: Mianserin at a low dose may be a promising
      therapeutic option for patients with acute neuroleptic-induced akathisia.

TI  - Use of atypical antipsychotic agents in bipolar and schizoaffective disorders:
      review of the empirical literature.
PG  - 354-61
AB  - Atypical antipsychotic agents seem to be effective treatments for bipolar
      disorder, especially as adjunctive treatments. They may be a safer and more
      effective alternative to the common practice of maintenance adjunctive treatment 
      with traditional antipsychotic agents in patients with bipolar disorder. However,
      currently available research studies are limited methodologically mainly to
      open-label, uncontrolled designs. Further research is required before the
      definitive efficacy of these agents in bipolar disorder is established. If
      randomized or double-blind data support the open-label data reviewed here,
      atypical antipsychotic agents may possess an important role in the adjunctive
      treatment of bipolar disorder.

TI  - A comparison of olanzapine with haloperidol in cannabis-induced psychotic
      disorder: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 177-80
AB  - Little controlled data exist on the treatment of substance induced psychotic
      disorders. In this study, 30 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for cannabis
      induced psychotic disorder were randomly allocated to receive either olanzapine
      or haloperidol in a 4-week double-blind clinical trial. There were no significant
      outcome differences between the two groups on any of the primary outcome
      measures, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (haloperidol 25.7; olanzapine 27.1; 
      P = 0.70); Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity scale (haloperidol 1.8,
      olanzapine 2.3; P = 0.21) or the CGI improvement scale (haloperidol 1.3,
      olanzapine 1.7; P = 0.16). The haloperidol group however, developed significantly
      more extrapyramidal side-effects as measured by the Simpson Angus Scale
      (haloperidol 11.4, olanzapine 2.5; P = 0.014). Significantly (P = 0.027) more
      biperidin was used for extrapyramidal side-effects in the haloperidol (7.143 mg) 
      than in the olanzapine (0.357 mg) group. Olanzapine appears to be as effective as
      haloperidol in the treatment of cannabis induced psychotic disorder, but is
      associated with a lower rate of extrapyramidal side-effects.

      four with generalized dystonia and one with Meige syndrome. All patients were
      evaluated at baseline and at least weekly while on medication with subjective
      assessment of response by the patient and physician rating using the
      Burke-Fahn-Marsden Evaluation Scale for Dystonia. All five subjects had
      significant improvement detected by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Evaluation Scale as
      well as subjective improvement while on clozapine. Side effects, such as sedation
      and orthostatic hypotension, developed in all patients but was only
      treatment-limiting in one subject who developed persistent symptomatic
      orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. Two of the four remaining patients
      continued clozapine after completion of the study; an additional patient was
      uncertain if the benefit outweighed the side effects. One patient discontinued
      treatment because of difficulty obtaining the FDA-required weekly white blood
      cell counts for patients on clozapine. We conclude that clozapine appears to be
      effective for generalized and refractory focal dystonia although its use may be
      limited by the side effects and need for hematologic monitoring.

TI  - The psychosis of schizophrenia: prevalence, response to atypical antipsychotics, 
      and prediction of outcome.
PG  - 361-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosis is a defining feature of schizophrenia consisting of formal
      thought disorder, delusions, and hallucinations. Although psychosis is present in
      the majority of patients with schizophrenia, the prevalence, responsiveness to
      atypical antipsychotic drug therapy, and prediction of outcome of individual
      psychotic symptoms in a population of well-diagnosed patients with schizophrenia 
      have not been conclusively established. METHODS: This paper examined the
      prevalence, responsiveness to the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, and
      relationship to outcome of individual psychotic symptoms using data from a
      previously reported large multicenter, double-blind clinical trial of olanzapine 
      (mean daily dose at endpoint = 13.6 +/- 6.9 mg/day). RESULTS: The most frequently
      reported psychotic symptoms at baseline were delusions (65%), conceptual
      disorganization (50%), and hallucinations (52%), and the majority of patients
      (68%) experienced from one to three symptoms. Additionally, with olanzapine
      treatment there were significant improvements (p < .001) in baseline to endpoint 
      Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) psychotic item scores, with the
      largest effect sizes observed for hallucinatory behavior, unusual thought
      content, suspiciousness/persecution, and delusions. During the acute phase of the
      trial, quality of life was correlated significantly with baseline conceptual
      disorganization (p = .038) and unusual thought content (p = .023), and time spent
      in the hospital was correlated with unusual thought content (p = .005).
      CONCLUSIONS: The implications of these for the clinical management of
      schizophrenia are discussed.

TI  - D-cycloserine increases positive symptoms in chronic schizophrenic patients when 
      administered in addition to antipsychotics: a double-blind, parallel,
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 203-10
AB  - A hypofunction of the glutamatergic system and NMDA receptors in schizophrenia
      has been hypothesized. Therefore, stimulation of these receptors could be of
      benefit to patients with schizophrenia. D-cycloserine has been used for this
      purpose. This study reports the effects of 100 mg D-cycloserine, when added to
      typical antipsychotics in chronic schizophrenic patients exhibiting prominent
      negative symptoms, using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel, design.
      D-cycloserine slightly worsened psychotic symptoms and general psychopathology as
      compared to placebo. D-cycloserine failed to change negative symptoms and had no 
      effect on extrapyramidal symptoms. The exacerbation of schizophrenic symptoms may
      be explained by the antagonistic effects of this dose of D-cycloserine at the
      glycine recognition site of the NMDA receptor due to competition with the
      endogenous agonist glycine. Another explanation for the increase in
      psychopathology may be an interaction with the effects of antipsychotics on NMDA 
      mediated neurotransmission. Thus, D-cycloserine in this study did not ameliorate 
      schizophrenic symptoms. However, the fact that they actually worsened suggests
      that NMDA systems may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Further
      placebo-controlled studies with lower dosages of D-cycloserine, preferably in
      drug-free patients, are necessary to evaluate if D-cycloserine is of use for the 
      treatment of patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Nicotine withdrawal and psychiatric symptoms in cigarette smokers with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 195-202
AB  - The prevalence of smoking is markedly elevated in schizophrenia. Low smoking
      cessation rates and reports that some smokers with schizophrenia experience an
      acute increase in symptoms during attempts to quit smoking, suggest a
      self-medication model. Alternatively, smoking may modulate medication side
      effects. The effects of treated and untreated smoking abstinence on psychotic
      symptoms and medication side effects were examined in this study. Nineteen
      outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in a
      randomized, double-blind, balanced crossover study: 1 day of ad libitum smoking
      followed by 3 days of acute smoking abstinence while wearing 22 mg/day active or 
      placebo transdermal nicotine patches, with a return to 3 days of smoking between 
      patch conditions. Daily symptom and side-effect ratings, nicotine and cotinine
      blood levels were collected. Twelve subjects completed the study. Neither
      positive symptoms nor mood symptoms changed. An increase in negative symptoms
      during the first abstinent day occurred in both placebo and active patch
      conditions, but was not sustained over subsequent abstinent days. Despite
      physiological signs of withdrawal, completers did not endorse increased nicotine 
      withdrawal symptoms. Dropouts reported higher withdrawal symptoms, but also had
      no increase in psychiatric symptoms in either phase of the study. Of note,
      dyskinesias decreased during abstinence and placebo patch treatment, but
      increased during abstinence and the active patch conditions. Acute exacerbation
      of psychiatric symptoms is an unlikely explanation for any difficulty smokers
      with schizophrenia have in early abstinence.

TI  - Reliability, validity, and application of the medical outcomes study 36-item
      short-form health survey (SF-36) in schizophrenic patients treated with
      olanzapine versus haloperidol.
PG  - 678-91
AB  - Schizophrenia leads to impairments in mental, social, and physical functioning,
      which should be included in evaluations of treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study was 
      designed to determine the reliability and validity of the Medical Outcomes Study 
      Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) for schizophrenic patients, to characterize
      perceived functioning and well being and to compare short-term change in SF-36
      scores for patients treated with olanzapine or haloperidol. RESEARCH DESIGN: Data
      were obtained from a randomized, double-blind trial comparing these agents for
      safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness. A 6-week acute treatment portion
      preceded a 46-week "responder extension" phase. SUBJECTS: A subsample (n = 1,155)
      completing a pre-treatment SF-36 provided data for this study. MEASURES:
      Psychometric analyses were conducted, and perceived level of functioning was
      compared with that for the US adult population. Change from baseline to 6 weeks
      was examined by treatment group. RESULTS: Clear evidence was obtained for the
      instrument's reliability and validity for these patients. There were marked
      deficits in General health, Vitality, Mental health, Social functioning, and in
      Role limitations resulting from both physical and emotional problems.
      Olanzapine-treated patients improved in 5 of 8 domains to a significantly greater
      degree than did haloperidol patients. CONCLUSIONS: The SF-36 can be a reliable
      and valid measure of perceived functioning and well being for schizophrenic
      patients. The perceptions of functioning can be valuable indices of disease
      burden and can help to demonstrate the effectiveness of newer antipsychotic
      medications such as olanzapine.

PG  - 395-405
AB  - A workshop on "Antipsychotics: Past and Future" was convened by the National
      Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Division of Services and Intervention Research
      (DSIR), on July 14, 1998, to review the results of recent antipsychotic drug
      research, discuss current standards of treatment, and identify areas needing
      further study. There has been a proliferation of new antipsychotic medications
      and a rapid increase in their clinical utilization. The new atypicals are
      beginning to supplant the older typical neuroleptic antipsychotics, and the
      scientific and ethical issues raised by this transition prompted the workshop.
      Given the apparent, albeit not fully defined, advantages of atypical drugs,
      particularly their safety profiles, the question is whether more comparisons with
      typical antipsychotics are warranted and whether clinical trial designs warrant
      (or would be justified in) the inclusion of typical drugs as standard active
      comparators. Workshop participants--including clinical researchers, patient
      advocates, bioethicists, and NIMH staff--discussed the conclusions drawn from
      current data, ethical issues for subjects in clinical trials, funding for ongoing
      studies using typical agents, and appropriate comparators for trials using
      atypical agents.

TI  - Glucose-induced increase in memory performance in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 321-35
AB  - Previous investigations have found that increasing circulating glucose
      availability can increase memory performance in rodents, healthy humans, and
      individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. In this study, patients with
      schizophrenia, healthy control subjects, and controls with bipolar affective
      disorder were tested using double-blind treatment with either 50 g anhydrous
      dextrose plus 4 mg sodium saccharin (for "taste") or 23.7 mg saccharin alone,
      followed by cognitive testing on a complex battery. At this glucose dose, verbal 
      memory performance on a paragraph recall task was increased during the glucose
      condition relative to the saccharin condition in the patients with schizophrenia;
      this effect was not detected in either the psychiatric or normal controls. The
      results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that memory performance
      can be improved in patients with schizophrenia by increasing circulating glucose 
      availability and suggest the importance of further evaluation of therapeutic
      manipulations of glucose availability.

TI  - The effects of neurocognitive remediation on executive processing in patients
      with schizophrenia.
PG  - 291-307
AB  - Approaches to cognitive remediation have differed across studies. Most of the
      larger studies have concentrated on group treatments designed without the benefit
      of recent laboratory-based studies. The current study describes a randomized
      trial of an intensive cognitive remediation program involving individual daily
      sessions of 1 hour for up to 3 months. It targets executive functioning deficits 
      (cognitive flexibility, working memory, and planning) that are known to be
      problematic in people with schizophrenia. Procedural learning, as well as the
      principles of errorless learning, targeted reinforcement, and massed practice,
      was the basis of the intervention. The program was compared with an alternative
      therapy (intensive occupational therapy) to control for some of the effects of
      therapeutic contact. Some improvements in cognition followed both therapies. A
      differential effect in favor of cognitive remediation therapy was found for tests
      in the cognitive flexibility and the memory subgroups. There was a trend for
      those receiving atypical antipsychotic medication to benefit more from cognitive 
      remediation for tests of cognitive flexibility. Although there were no consistent
      changes in symptoms or social functioning between groups, if improvement in
      cognitive flexibility tasks reached a threshold then there is some evidence that 
      social functioning improved, even over the short duration of the trial. In
      addition, cognitive remediation differentially improved self-esteem. This study
      supports the view that cognitive remediation can reduce cognitive deficits and
      that this reduction may affect social outcome, at least in the short term.

TI  - The effects of clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine on cognitive function in
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 233-55
AB  - Cognitive function is markedly impaired in most patients with schizophrenia.
      Antecedents of this impairment are evident in childhood. The cognitive disability
      is nearly fully developed at the first episode of psychosis in most patients. The
      contribution of cognitive impairment to outcome in schizophrenia, especially work
      function, has been established. Preliminary results indicate that cognitive
      function, along with disorganization symptoms, discriminate schizophrenia
      patients who are able to work full-time from those who are not. Typical
      neuroleptic drugs lack the ability to improve the various domains of cognitive
      function impaired in schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs
      pharmacologically related to clozapine-quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone,
      sertindole, and ziprasidone--share the ability to produce fewer extrapyramidal
      symptoms than typical neuroleptic drugs and more potent antagonism of serotonin2a
      relative to dopamine2 receptors. However, they have a number of different
      clinical effects. We have identified all the studies of clozapine, olanzapine,
      and risperidone that provide data on their effects on cognition in schizophrenia.
      Data for each drug are reviewed separately in order to identify differences among
      them in their effects on cognition. Twelve studies that report cognitive effects 
      of clozapine are reviewed. These studies provide (1) strong evidence that
      clozapine improves attention and verbal fluency and (2) moderate evidence that
      clozapine improves some types of executive function. However, results of the
      effects of clozapine on working memory and secondary verbal and spatial memory
      were inconclusive. Risperidone has relatively consistent positive effects on
      working memory, executive functioning, and attention, whereas improvement in
      verbal learning and memory was inconsistent. Preliminary evidence presented here 
      suggests that olanzapine improves verbal learning and memory, verbal fluency, and
      executive function, but not attention, working memory, or visual learning and
      memory. Thus, atypical antipsychotic drugs as a group appear to be superior to
      typical neuroleptics with regard to cognitive function. However, available data
      suggest that these drugs produce significant differences in specific cognitive
      functions. These differences may be valuable adjunctive guides for their use in
      clinical practice if cognitive improvements reach clinical significance. The
      effects of the atypical antipsychotic drugs on cholinergic and 5-HT2a-mediated
      neurotransmission as the possible basis for their ability to improve cognition
      are discussed. It is suggested that the development of drugs for schizophrenia
      should focus on improving the key cognitive deficits in schizophrenia: executive 
      function, verbal fluency, working memory, verbal and visual learning and memory, 
      and attention.

      schizophrenia: a review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 201-22
AB  - Cognitive deficits are a fundamental feature of the psychopathology of
      schizophrenia. Yet the effect of treatment on this dimension of the illness has
      been unclear. Atypical antipsychotic medications have been reported to reduce the
      neurocognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. However, studies of the 
      pattern and degree of cognitive improvement with these compounds have been
      methodologically limited and have produced variable results, and few findings
      have been replicated. To clarify our understanding of the effects of atypical
      antipsychotic drugs on neurocognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia, we
      have (1) reported on newly established standards for research design in studies
      of treatment effects on cognitive function in schizophrenia, (2) reviewed the
      literature on this topic and determined the extent to which 15 studies on the
      effect of atypical antipsychotics met these standards, (3) performed a
      meta-analysis of the 15 studies, which suggested general cognitive enhancement
      with atypical antipsychotics, and (4) described the pharmacological profile of
      these agents and considered the pharmacological basis for their effects on
      neurocognition. Finally, we suggest directions for the development of new
      therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy and acceptability of atypical antipsychotic drugs: a
      meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials.
PG  - 341-6
AB  - Knowing the clinical differences of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone would
      be of benefit for choosing an atypical antipsychotic drug. In order to compare
      their efficacy and acceptability, we conducted a meta-analysis of published,
      randomized, placebo-controlled trials by comparing the response and dropout rates
      of an atypical antipsychotic drug group and those of a placebo group. After a
      comprehensive search of study reports, the response and dropout rates of patients
      treated with an atypical antipsychotic drug and those treated with placebo were
      extracted on the intention-to-treat basis. The effect size with 95 per cent
      confidence interval (CI) of pooled data comparing the response and dropout rates 
      of an atypical antipsychotic drug group and those of a placebo group were
      calculated by using the Peto method. The response-rate effect sizes (95% CIs) of 
      olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone were 1.75 (1.06 to 2.89), 1.71 (1.20 to
      2.42), and 3.28 (1.98 to 5.44), respectively. The dropout-rate effect sizes (95% 
      CIs) of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone were 0.55 (0.35 to 0.88), 0.65
      (0.46 to 0.91), and 0.39 (0.24 to 0.62), respectively. In conclusion, olanzapine,
      quetiapine, and risperidone are more effective and more acceptable than placebo
      in treating schizophrenic patients. However, they are not different from each
      other in the respect of efficacy and acceptability. The cost of these agents
      should play an important role in choosing an atypical antipsychotic drug.

TI  - Olanzapine in the treatment of adolescent acute mania: a report of seven cases.
PG  - 279-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine may be effective in adults and adolescents with
      treatment-resistant bipolar disorder. Olanzapine has a receptor affinity profile 
      similar to that of clozapine. METHODS: The responses of seven consecutive
      adolescents (ages 12-17) with DSM-IV bipolar disorder, manic episode, treated
      with olanzapine were evaluated. Response to olanzapine was rated as marked,
      moderate, minimal, none or worse. RESULTS: Five (71%) adolescents showed a marked
      or moderate response. The mean+/-SD olanzapine dose was 0.146+/-0.086 mg/kg/day
      (11+/-6 mg/day). CONCLUSION: Olanzapine may have antimanic effects in some
      adolescents with acute mania. Controlled studies of olanzapine in adolescent
      bipolar disorder appear to be warranted.

TI  - Clinical and quantitative EEG studies of mania.
PG  - 217-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Earlier EEG studies reported essentially normal findings during acute
      manic episodes but some atypical EEG characteristics and distinctions between
      familial and sporadic cases were described. Recently quantitative EEG (qEEG)
      studies differentiating mania from schizophrenia and depression have been
      published. METHODS: Clinical EEGs were obtained in 202 patients hospitalized for 
      acute mania. EEGs were repeated in 75 patients rehospitalized for subsequent
      manic attacks. Quantitative EEGs were recorded in 37 patients who were able to
      cooperate after drug washout and again on completion of randomly assigned
      pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: Normal EEGs were obtained in most patients. Moderately 
      abnormal EEGs in 16% were significantly associated with absent family histories
      of affective disorder. Left sided abnormalities were more common than right.
      "Small sharp spikes" and "microsleep" were encountered in 17% and 10%
      respectively of patients who drowsed. EEG findings during subsequent episodes did
      not suggest increasing CNS vulnerability. qEEGs showed significant differences
      between each of the therapeutic agents compared-lithium, carbamazepine, and
      lithium combined with carbamazepine, haloperidol or risperidone. Nonresponders at
      baseline had significantly more diffuse theta activity than responders. During
      pharmacotherapy nonresponders had higher amplitudes in the left temporoparietal
      areas. LIMITATION: Clinical EEG findings confirmed previous reports but did not
      contain original observations. Applications of qEEG were limited by requirements 
      for patient cooperation.

TI  - Lithium augmentation fails to reduce symptoms in poorly responsive schizophrenic 
      outpatients.
PG  - 366-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nearly one third of patients suffering from schizophrenia do not
      fully respond to antipsychotic medication. Safe, effective, and cost-efficient
      methods to reduce symptoms are clearly needed; therefore, lithium as an adjunct
      to fluphenazine decanoate was tested in a placebo-controlled trial in outpatients
      who were part of the Treatment Strategies of Schizophrenia (TSS) study. METHOD:
      Forty-one patients with DSM-III schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were
      assigned to either adjunctive lithium or placebo after at least 6 months of
      fluphenazine decanoate treatment to stabilize symptoms had failed. The trial was 
      designed for 8 weeks of treatment, and patients assigned to placebo could
      afterward be administered lithium in an 8-week, open-label study. RESULTS:
      Assessment of the intent-to-treat analysis revealed no significant differences in
      demographic variables between the lithium and placebo groups. Although both
      groups showed significant (p = .00135) improvement as measured by total scores on
      the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), there were no significant differences 
      in response between the lithium and placebo groups. Patients originally treated
      with placebo added to neuroleptic did not have significantly greater improvement 
      when receiving open-label adjunctive lithium. CONCLUSION: Although success with
      lithium augmentation therapy for persistent psychosis has been reported in the
      past, this study of well-characterized patients showed no benefit for this common
      strategy, thus indicating that care be used in utilizing lithium augmentation.

TI  - Clozapine and obsessions in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and other
      psychotic disorders.
PG  - 364-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increase or emergence of obsessions was compared in young
      patients with recent-onset schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders taking
      clozapine and other antipsychotic drugs. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective
      cohort study. Subjects were 121 consecutively admitted patients diagnosed with
      DSM-III-R schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or 
      psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. Obsessions were diagnosed according
      to DSM-IV criteria. RESULTS: More clozapine-treated subjects (20.6%) than
      subjects treated with other antipsychotic drugs (1.3%) experienced an emergence
      or increase of obsessions (p<.01). CONCLUSION: Use of clozapine is associated
      with the emergence or increase of obsessions in early-phase schizophrenia.

TI  - Novel antipsychotics: comparison of weight gain liabilities.
PG  - 358-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: We performed a retrospective analysis of 122 clinical records of 92
      male patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia to examine the relative weight gain
      liabilities of clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and sertindole compared with
      haloperidol. We hypothesized that the unique pharmacodynamic profiles of these
      agents would contribute to different amounts and patterns of weight gain. METHOD:
      Data were analyzed to determine differences in weight gain during treatment among
      patients receiving 5 different drug treatments (clozapine [N = 20], olanzapine [N
      = 13], risperidone [N = 38], haloperidol [N = 43], and sertindole [N = 8]).
      Measures of maximal weight gain, final weight, and duration to maximal weight
      gain were calculated. RESULTS: Repeated measures analyses of variance controlling
      for age, treatment duration, and initial weight revealed statistically
      significant differences between groups on all 3 measures. Clozapine and
      olanzapine had the greatest maximal weight gain liability (F = 4.13, df = 4,23; p
      = .01). Weight gain with clozapine, but not olanzapine or risperidone, appears to
      persist (as reflected by final weight) despite behavioral interventions (e.g.,
      nutritional consultation, suggested exercise regimen; F = 5.69, df = 4,23; p =
      .003). Clozapine- and olanzapine-treated subjects appeared to gain weight over a 
      prolonged period of time, whereas risperidone-and sertindole-treated subjects had
      a more limited period of weight gain (F = 2.95, df = 4,25; p = .04). CONCLUSION: 
      Clozapine and olanzapine caused the most weight gain, risperidone was
      intermediate, and sertindole had less associated weight gain than haloperidol.
      The relative receptor affinities of the novel antipsychotics for histamine H1
      appear to be the most robust correlate of these clinical findings.

TI  - Evidence of clozapine's effectiveness in schizophrenia: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomized trials.
PG  - 990-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate all available trial-based
      evidence on the effectiveness of clozapine in schizophrenia as compared with
      conventional neuroleptics. METHOD: All randomized, controlled trials comparing
      clozapine with a conventional neuroleptic in which there was satisfactory
      concealment of patients' treatment allocation were located through electronic
      searches in all languages of several databases and through contacting authors of 
      recent trials as well as the manufacturer of clozapine. At least two independent 
      reviewers assessed trials for inclusion in the study and extracted data for
      meta-analysis. RESULTS: The review included 2,530 randomly assigned participants 
      in 30 trials, most of them short-term. Clozapine-treated patients showed more
      clinical improvement and experienced significantly fewer relapses during
      treatment, although the risk of blood dyscrasias in long-term treatment may be as
      high as 7%. Scores on symptom rating scales showed greater improvement among
      clozapine-treated patients, who were also more satisfied with their treatment.
      However, there was no evidence that the superior clinical effect of clozapine is 
      reflected in levels of functioning; on the other hand, global functional and
      pragmatic outcomes were frequently not reported. Clinical improvement was most
      pronounced in patients with treatment-resistant illness. CONCLUSIONS: This
      meta-analysis confirms that clozapine is more effective than conventional
      neuroleptics in reducing symptoms of patients with both treatment-resistant and
      nonresistant schizophrenia. Future trials should be long-term pragmatic community
      trials or should address the effectiveness of clozapine in special patient
      populations. An international standard set of outcomes, including pragmatic
      assessments of functioning, would greatly enhance the comparison and summation of
      trials and future assessments of effectiveness.

TI  - Switching from therapy with typical antipsychotic agents to risperidone:
      long-term impact on patient outcome.
PG  - 806-17
AB  - This paper reports the results of a retrospective, open-label study in 31
      schizophrenic patients who had been switched from therapy with a typical
      antipsychotic agent to risperidone, a novel antipsychotic agent, in the course of
      their treatment in an outpatient/community program. The study was based on both a
      review of all 31 patients' charts and a structured interview of 26 of the
      patients. The change to risperidone had been made because of lack of efficacy or 
      intolerance to typical antipsychotic agents after a mean of 3.5 years of therapy.
      Patients had been maintained on risperidone for a mean of 1.7 years at the time
      of the review. The impact of switching to risperidone was assessed by comparing
      clinical variables for the patients with their own historic control data. The
      current levels of symptoms, side effects, and social functioning were also
      assessed by means of the Interview for Retrospective Assessment of Onset of
      Schizophrenia and rating scales. Seventy-one percent and 81% of the patients
      exhibited a positive response, as measured by a 30% reduction in psychotic and
      disorganization syndromes, respectively. After the switch, significant declines
      were noted in service utilization; the level of psychotic, disorganization, and
      negative symptom dimensions; and the use of anticholinergic drugs (P < 0.01 for
      all). Assessments conducted at the time of the review revealed a low level of
      psychotic (mean, 3.5) and disorganization (mean, 3.0) symptoms, a moderate level 
      of negative symptoms (mean, 19.5), and a low level of extrapyramidal symptoms
      (total mean parkinsonism score, 6.0). No significant changes were seen in the
      level of employment or in living conditions. Results of this study suggest that a
      switch to risperidone therapy because of the inefficacy of typical antipsychotic 
      agents or patients' inability to tolerate them may lead to sustained and
      significant improvement in a substantial proportion of patients with
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Olanzapine acute administration in schizophrenic patients increases delta sleep
      and sleep efficiency.
PG  - 141-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: A delta sleep deficit has been observed in schizophrenic patients.
      Olanzapine is a novel atypical antipsychotic agent with affinity at dopaminergic,
      serotonergic, muscarinic, adrenergic and histaminergic binding sites. The present
      study was designed to analyze a sleep promoting effect reported for olanzapine.
      METHODS: Twenty schizophrenic patients (DSM-IV) were studied, who were drug free 
      and inpatients. Patients slept for 5 consecutive nights in the sleep unit as
      follows: one acclimatization night; two baseline nights (the first for sleep
      disorder screenings); and two olanzapine nights (10 mg olanzapine, one hour
      before sleep onset). RESULTS: Sleep continuity variables and total sleep time
      showed an overall improvement with olanzapine. Waking time was reduced since the 
      first night of olanzapine administration. The main sleep architecture changes
      were: reduction in sleep stage 1, while sleep stage 2 and delta were
      significantly enhanced. Rapid eye movement density was also increased by the
      second olanzapine night. CONCLUSIONS: Total sleep improvement was due to the
      increase in sleep stages 2 and delta sleep. This may be related to serotonergic
      antagonistic properties of olanzapine. Olanzapine seems to have a sleep promoting
      effect in schizophrenic patients.

TI  - Treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients respond to clozapine after olanzapine 
      non-response.
PG  - 73-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment-resistance in schizophrenia remains a public health
      problem. Clozapine has been shown to be effective in about one third of this
      population, but carries with it medical risks and weekly blood draws. As
      olanzapine is a drug with a very similar biochemical profile to clozapine, it is 
      important to evaluate whether non-response to olanzapine predicts clozapine
      non-response. METHODS: Forty-four treatment-resistant patients received eight
      weeks of olanzapine, either in a double-blind trial or subsequent open treatment 
      at a mean daily dose of 25 mg/day. Two of 44 patients (5%) responded to
      olanzapine treatment. Patients who did not respond could then receive clozapine. 
      Twenty-seven subsequently received an 8-week open trial of clozapine. RESULTS:
      Patients who did and did not receive clozapine did not differ demographically or 
      in psychopathology. Eleven of 27 (41%) met a priori response criteria during
      clozapine treatment (mean dose 693 mg/day) after failing to respond to
      olanzapine. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that failure to respond to
      olanzapine treatment does not predict failure to clozapine. Treatment-resistant
      patients who fail on olanzapine may benefit from a subsequent trial of clozapine.

TI  - Absence of interaction between erythromycin and a single dose of clozapine.
PG  - 221-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the suggested pharmacokinetic interaction between
      erythromycin, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, and clozapine. METHODS: Twelve
      healthy male volunteers received a single dose of 12.5 mg of clozapine alone or
      in combination with a daily dose of 1500 mg erythromycin in a randomised
      crossover study. Clozapine and its metabolites clozapine-N-oxide and
      desmethyl-clozapine were measured in serum samples which were collected during a 
      48 h period and in a sample of the urine secreted over the interval 0-12 h.
      RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean area under the serum
      concentration time curves (1348 (633) nmol h x l(-1) in the control phase and
      1180 (659) nmol h x l(-1) in the erythromycin phase), terminal halflives (19 (13)
      h and 15 (6) h, respectively), peak serum concentrations (92 (53) nmol x l(-1)
      and 77 (40) nmol x l(-1), respectively), time to peak serum concentrations (1.4
      (0.7) h and 1.5 (1.0) h, respectively) or apparent oral clearances of clozapine
      (34 (15) l x h(-1) and 46 (37) l x h(-1), respectively). There were no
      significant differences in partial metabolic clearances to clozapine-N-oxide (5.1
      (3.6) l x h(-1) and 7.8 (9.4) l x h(-1), respectively) or to desmethyl-clozapine 
      (1.5 (1.3) l x h(-1) and 1.8 (1.7) l x h(-1), respectively) or in renal
      clearances of clozapine (0.8 (0.5) l x h(-1) and 1.0 (0.7) l x h(-1),
      respectively) between the two phases. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that 
      erythromycin at a clinically relevant dosage does not inhibit the metabolism of
      clozapine. Hence, CYP3A4 seems to be of minor importance in the disposition of
      clozapine in humans at least when clozapine is taken at a low single dose.

TI  - Risperidone-induced increase of plasma norepinephrine is not correlated with
      symptom improvement in chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 1653-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown an increase in plasma levels of
      norepinephrine (NE) after clozapine treatment of schizophrenia. This effect has
      been suggested to relate to improvement in symptoms. METHODS: To test whether
      other novel antipsychotic drugs have such an effect, the present experiment
      examined schizophrenic symptoms and plasma levels of NE before and after 5 weeks 
      of treatment with risperidone or haloperidol. RESULTS: Risperidone, but not
      haloperidol, significantly increased plasma NE; however, there was no correlation
      of this effect with clinical improvement on any symptom scale. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      finding suggests that risperidone shares similar properties with clozapine in
      enhancing peripheral NE, but that these changes in plasma NE may not be a
      consistent indicator of atypical antipsychotic drug efficacy.

TI  - The effects of clozapine on cognitive functioning in schizophrenia.
PG  - 24-9
AB  - Cognitive function may be markedly impaired in patients with schizophrenia;
      however, it has only recently been recognized as an important factor in
      determining patient outcome. Research has shown that improvements in cognitive
      functioning occur independently of improvements in positive or negative clinical 
      symptoms, and whereas typical antipsychotics may improve clinical symptoms, they 
      have little or no efficacy in improving cognitive dysfunction. However, there is 
      evidence that the atypical antipsychotic clozapine may improve this core deficit 
      of schizophrenia. This review summarizes 12 published studies that assessed the
      effect of clozapine on cognitive functioning. As a group, these studies suggest
      that psychomotor speed, verbal fluency, and verbal learning and memory may be
      improved by treatment with clozapine. Such cognitive improvements with clozapine 
      treatment may offer an advantage to patients with schizophrenia by enhancing the 
      possibility of better vocational functioning and quality of life.

TI  - Negative symptoms in schizophrenia: neurobiological models and treatment
      response.
PG  - 59-77
AB  - Evidence from lesioning studies and neuroimaging has linked negative symptoms to 
      dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and the basal ganglia.
      Although such symptoms have been most strongly associated with dopaminergic
      hypoactivity in the prefrontal cortex, other neurotransmitters including
      norepinephrine, serotonin, and the excitatory amino acids may also play a role.
      In some patients moderate doses of conventional neuroleptics clearly improve
      negative symptoms; the response of such symptoms is relatively greater with
      clozapine and probably with certain serotonin-dopamine antagonists. Recent
      studies demonstrating improvement of negative symptoms when conventional
      neuroleptics are augmented with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or with
      agents active at the glycine-modulatory site of the glutamatergic
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex suggest that further amelioration of
      primary negative symptoms may be possible through pharmacological strategies
      involving multiple neurotransmitter systems.

TI  - Clinical outcome to clozapine treatment in chronic psychiatric inpatients.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - 1. A review of the medical records in a state psychiatric hospital was conducted 
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine. 2.
      Using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), four groups of schizophrenic
      inpatients (n = 59) were operationally defined: Nonresponders (< 20% decrease
      from pre-drug baseline); Short-term Pharmacological Responders (20% decline, but 
      not sustained); Long-term Pharmacological Responders (maintained a 20% decline)
      and Clinical Responders (maintained a 20% decline and achieved a BPRS < or = 36; 
      the criterion of Kane et al. 1988). 3. There were 7 NRs, 13 STPRs, 21 LTPRs and
      18 CRs 4. The STPR, LTPR and CR groups improved significantly within the first
      month of treatment and reached a 20% decrease in BPRS by 3 months. CRs required 5
      months to attain a BPRS < or = 36. These criteria were reached at the same
      average doses (about 300-400 mg/day). 5. The proportion of CRs (30%) in this
      retrospective, naturalistic study, is remarkably close to the results of the
      definitive study by Kane et al. 1988. These results are also consistent with many
      of the controlled research studies of clozapine in hospitalized, treatment
      refractory psychiatric patients.

TI  - Lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia with risperidone compared with haloperidol 
      in older patients.
PG  - 716-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the 9-month cumulative incidence of tardive dyskinesia (TD)
      with risperidone to that with haloperidol in older patients. DESIGN: A
      prospective longitudinal study. SETTING: An outpatient psychiatric clinic.
      PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were middle-aged and older (mean age 66 years) patients
      with schizophrenia, dementia, mood disorders, or other conditions with psychotic 
      symptoms or severe behavioral disturbances. Sixty-one patients on risperidone
      were matched with 61 patients from a larger sample of haloperidol-treated
      patients in regard to age, diagnosis, and length of pre-enrollment neuroleptic
      intake to create clinically comparable groups. The median daily dose of each
      medication was 1.0 mg. MEASUREMENTS: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale,
      modified Simpson-Angus' scale for extrapyramidal symptoms, Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale, and Mini-Mental State Examination were administered at baseline, 1 
      month, and 3, 6, and 9 months. The diagnosis of TD was based on specific research
      criteria. The raters were blind to the patient's medication status. RESULTS: Life
      table analysis revealed that patients treated with haloperidol were significantly
      more likely to develop TD than patients treated with risperidone (P < .05,
      Peto-Prentice). CONCLUSIONS: The atypical antipsychotic risperidone is
      significantly less likely to result in TD than the conventional neuroleptic
      haloperidol in a high-risk group of older patients, at least over a 9-month
      period.

TI  - Small effects of valproic acid on the plasma concentrations of clozapine and its 
      major metabolites in patients with schizophrenic or affective disorders.
PG  - 341-5
AB  - Two separate studies were carried out to assess the effect of valproic acid on
      the steady-state plasma concentrations of clozapine and its major metabolites
      norclozapine and clozapine N-oxide in psychotic patients. In the first study,
      concentrations of clozapine and metabolites were compared between patients
      treated with clozapine in combination with sodium valproate (n = 15) and control 
      patients treated with clozapine alone (n = 22) and matched for sex, age, body
      weight, and antipsychotic dosage. Patients comedicated with valproate tended to
      have higher clozapine levels and lower norclozapine levels, but the differences
      did not reach statistical significance. In a subsequent study, plasma
      concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites were determined in 6 patients
      with schizophrenia stabilized on clozapine therapy (200-400 mg/d) before and
      after treatment with sodium valproate (900-1200 mg/d) for 4 weeks. Mean plasma
      concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites did not change significantly
      throughout the study, but there was a trend for clozapine levels to be higher and
      for norclozapine levels to be lower after valproate. Overall, these findings
      suggest that valproic acid may have an inhibiting effect on the CYP1A2- or
      CYP3A4-mediated conversion of clozapine to norclozapine. However, the interaction
      is unlikely to be clinically significant.

      use. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Clozapine in
      Refractory Schizophrenia.
PG  - 565-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined the relationship between pretreatment hospital
      use and the cost-effectiveness of clozapine in the treatment of refractory
      schizophrenia. METHODS: Data from a 15-site randomized clinical trial were used
      to compare clozapine with haloperidol in hospitalized Veterans Affairs patients
      with refractory schizophrenia (n = 423). Outcomes were compared among those with 
      many days in the hospital use (hereafter, high hospital users) (n = 141; mean =
      215 psychiatric hospital days in the year prior to study entry) and those with
      few days in the hospital use (hereafter, low hospital users) (n = 282; mean = 58 
      hospital days). Analyses were conducted with the full intention-to-treat sample
      (n = 423) and with crossovers excluded (n = 291). RESULTS: Clozapine treatment
      resulted in greater reduction in hospital use among high hospital users (35 days 
      less than controls, P = .02) than among low users (21 days less than controls, P 
      = .05). Patients taking clozapine also had lower health care costs; after
      including the costs of both medications and other health services, costs were
      $7134 less than for controls among high hospital users (P = .14) but only $759
      less than for controls among low hospital users (P = .82). Clinical improvement
      in the domains of symptoms, quality of life, extrapyramidal symptoms, and a
      synthetic measure of multiple outcomes favored clozapine in both high and low
      hospital user groups. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial 1-year cost savings with clozapine
      are observed only among patients with very high hospital use prior to initiation 
      of treatment while clinical benefits are more similar across groups.
      Cost-effectiveness evaluations, and particularly studies of expensive treatments,
      cannot be generalized across type of use groups.

TI  - Is bipolar disorder still underdiagnosed? Are antidepressants overutilized?
PG  - 135-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that bipolar disorder may be
      underdiagnosed, and that antidepressants may be over-utilized in its treatment.
      METHODS: Consecutively admitted patients (n =48) diagnosed with DSM-IV bipolar
      disorder, type I, (n = 44) or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, (n = 4)
      were interviewed systematically and their charts were reviewed to confirm
      diagnosis before admission. They were then treated according to systematic
      structured interview diagnoses. These data reflect the changes in diagnoses and
      treatment. RESULTS: 40% (19/48) were identified with previously undiagnosed
      bipolar disorder, all previously diagnosed with unipolar major depressive
      disorder. A period of 7.5+/-9.8 years elapsed in this group before bipolar
      diagnosis was made. Antidepressant use was high on admission (38%) and was
      reduced with acceptable treatment response rates. The adjunctive use of
      risperidone appeared to be a good treatment alternative. LIMITATIONS: While
      diagnoses were made prospectively, treatment response was assessed
      retrospectively, and was based on non-randomized, naturalistic therapy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Systematic application of DSM-IV criteria identified previously
      undiagnosed bipolar disorder in 40% of a referred population of patients with
      mood disorders, all previously misdiagnosed as unipolar major depressive
      disorder. Antidepressants appeared overutilized and risperidone was an effective 
      alternative adjunctive therapy agent.

TI  - Bipolar disorder in old age.
PG  - 1229-37
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the classification, clinical characteristics, and
      epidemiology of bipolar disorders in old age with a special focus on neurologic
      comorbidity, high mortality, and management. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Most available 
      data is gleaned from retrospective chart reviews and cohort studies. Treatment
      recommendations are based on evidence from younger populations and a few
      anecdotal case reports and series involving elderly people. MAIN MESSAGE: While
      relatively rare in the community setting, mania in old age frequently leads to
      hospitalization. It is associated with late-onset neurologic disorders
      (especially cerebrovascular disease) involving the right hemisphere and
      orbitofrontal cortex. Prognosis is relatively poor; morbidity and mortality rates
      are high. Management of bipolarity includes cautious use of mood stabilizers,
      especially lithium and divalproex. CONCLUSIONS: Mania in old age should trigger a
      careful assessment of underlying neurologic disease, especially cerebrovascular
      disease. Close clinical follow up is essential.

TI  - Does akathisia influence psychopathology in psychotic patients treated with
      clozapine?
PG  - 1376-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Akathisia has been reported to predict more severe symptoms and
      poorer treatment response to typical neuroleptics among patients with
      schizophrenia. Akathisia has also been associated with symptom exacerbation. This
      study addressed four questions: 1) Does akathisia predict greater severity in
      global psychopathology? 2) Is this effect global or specific? 3) Does clozapine
      treatment alter this relationship? 4) Does severity of psychopathology covary
      with the level of akathisia? METHODS: Akathisia and clinical symptoms were
      examined in 33 "treatment refractory" schizophrenic patients treated with
      clozapine across 16 weeks. Weekly ratings were Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale,
      Abbreviated Dyskinesia Rating Scale, and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).
      Patients were classified as "with" (n = 15) or "without" (n = 18) akathisia. Data
      analyses involved independent t-test comparisons of selected variables,
      between-group multivariate analyses of variance across time for BPRS Total scores
      and Guy's five factors, and partial correlations to assess covariation between
      BPRS scores and level of akathisia. RESULTS: Akathisia predicted more severe
      global psychopathology, specific to the Activation (AC) and Thought Disturbance
      (TH) factors. These relationships did not change with clozapine treatment even
      when akathisia declined. Interestingly, level of akathisia did not covary with
      severity of psychopathology. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, akathisia predicted
      more severe psychopathology, specific to AC and TH BPRS factor scores. Clozapine 
      treatment did not alter this relationship. Although the presence of akathisia
      predicted more severe symptoms, the level of akathisia did not covary across time
      with severity of psychopathology, suggesting an "uncoupling" of these symptom
      domains.

TI  - Acute and chronic effects of clozapine in essential tremor.
PG  - 468-72
AB  - Patients with essential tremor (ET) may not respond to commonly used drugs.
      Clozapine, an atypical neuroleptic drug, has been reported to improve postural
      Parkinson's disease tremor clinically resembling ET. The effects of a single dose
      of 12.5 mg clozapine and placebo were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind,
      crossover study in 15 drug-resistant patients with ET. Patient responders with
      more than 50% improvement after a single dose of clozapine subsequently received 
      the drug (39+/-9 mg up to 50 mg) unblinded for a period of 15.8+/-7.7 months.
      Tremor was effectively reduced by a single dose of clozapine in 13 of 15 patients
      (p <0.01). Sedation was the only side effect reported during the clozapine test; 
      however, the time course of sedation and of the antitremor effect were not
      coincident. A significant reduction of tremor was reported with chronic clozapine
      treatment (p <0.01) with no tolerance to drug antitremor effect, whereas sedation
      markedly decreased after 6-7 weeks of therapy. No clozapine-induced hematologic
      side effects were observed in our cohort of patients during long-term treatment. 
      Our results suggest that in selected drug-resistant ET cases, clozapine should be
      considered before resorting to neurosurgical options.

AB  - The authors evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of risperidone in
      103 elderly patients (mean age, 71 years) with schizophrenia (75%) or
      schizoaffective disorder (25%). Using the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale
      (ESRS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Clinical Global
      Impression (CGI) scale, they conducted a prospective, open-label, 12-week trial
      in 14 psychiatric centers in the United States. Patients' symptoms were assessed 
      at baseline and over a 12-week period. At endpoint, ESRS scores were
      significantly reduced, as were PANSS total and subscale scores. There were no
      clinically significant changes in electrocardiograms, laboratory test results, or
      vital signs. Risperidone was well tolerated and efficacious in elderly patients
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

TI  - Spontaneous slow and fast MEG activity in male schizophrenics treated with
      clozapine.
PG  - 375-82
AB  - RATIONALE: The atypical neuroleptic clozapine induces specific
      electroencephalogram changes, which have not been investigated using the
      technique of magnetoencephalography (MEG). OBJECTIVE: The present study
      investigated whether spontaneous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity in
      patients treated with clozapine differs from that in patients treated with
      haloperidol and untreated control subjects. METHODS: A 2 x 37 channel biomagnetic
      system was used to record spontaneous magnetic activity for the frequency ranges 
      (2-6 Hz), (7.5-12 Hz), (12.5-30 Hz) in schizophrenic patients and controls in two
      trials within 3 weeks. After data acquisition, the processed data were digitally 
      filtered and the spatial distribution of dipoles was determined by a 3-D
      convolution with a Gaussian envelope. The dipole localisation was calculated by
      the dipole density plot and the principal component analysis. The target
      parameters were absolute dipole values and the dipole localisations. The
      relationship between absolute dipole values, dipole localisations and
      psychopathological findings (documented by the use of the PANSS, BPRS-scale)
      during a 3 week period with constant doses of clozapine and haloperidol was
      investigated using correlation analysis. RESULTS: Our results lend strong support
      to the assumption of a significant elevation of absolute dipole values [dipole
      density maximum (Dmax), dipole number (Dtotal), absolute and relative dipole
      density] in the fast frequency range (12.5-30 Hz) over the left hemisphere,
      especially in the temporoparietal region by clozapine. In this area, we found a
      dipole concentration effect only in patients treated with the atypical
      neuroleptic, whereas the dipole distribution in patients treated with haloperidol
      and healthy controls was concentrated in the central region. With regard to the
      absolute dipole values in the frequency ranges 2-6 Hz (delta, theta) and 7.5-12
      Hz (alpha), we found no statistically significant differences between the groups 
      investigated. In the slow frequency range (2-6 Hz) no difference was found
      between the clozapine and haloperidol group for the dipole localisation, which
      predominated in the temporoparietal region, in contrast to the central dipole
      distribution in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The results of an increase in beta
      activity under clozapine demonstrate a smaller reduction in activity in terms of 
      unspecific sensory and motor paradigms in comparison with typical neuroleptics.
      The temporoparietal concentration of dipoles, in particular over the left half of
      the brain, might illustrate either their special role in the disease process, or 
      the effects of the medication. The latter possibility was supported by the
      differing dipole distribution in the clozapine group with a left temporoparietal 
      centre in both frequency ranges, and a deviating central dipole localisation in
      the fast activity range in the haloperidol group.

AB  - Many mentally ill women want to breast-feed their babies but, if they are taking 
      psychotropic drugs, there is very little systematic data upon which to base
      decisions about whether or not it is safe to do so. We therefore attempt to
      provide a comprehensive and critical summary of existing case reports and of
      studies of breast-feeding in relation to commonly used psychotropic drugs. The
      literature review focuses on the following drugs: antidepressants: tricyclics and
      serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); antipsychotic drugs:
      chlorpromazine, perphenazine, haloperidol and clozapine; mood stabilizers:
      lithium and carbamazepine; and benzodiazepines. The research literature consists 
      mainly of single case reports and there have been very few attempts at
      controlled, longitudinal investigations. Findings are often difficult to compare 
      because of differences in methods or because of lack of key information. Most
      data are available about the tricyclic antidepressants but even here we have
      found that the reports cover only a grand total of 66 mother-infant pairs.
      Dilemmas about whether or not to contraindicate breast-feeding arise most
      commonly in relation to postnatal depression. The findings to date suggest that
      provided that infants are healthy at the outset it is likely that the benefits of
      breast-feeding will outweigh potential hazards if their mothers are taking
      established tricyclic drugs at recommended dose levels. Much less is known about 
      risks associated with SSRI antidepressants or about antipsychotic drugs such as
      phenothiazines and butyrophenones or mood stabilizers such as carbamazepine, all 
      of which enter breast-milk. Safeguards are suggested for future single case
      studies, which, as they accumulate, will provide a platform for mounting
      controlled prospective studies properly to test for any acute toxic effects and
      for possible long-term adverse effects of such drugs on infants' development.
      Appendix 1 is a review of assay methods. Appendix 2 examines pharmacokinetic
      factors in newborn preterm and sick infants with special reference to
      contraindications to breast-feeding. Appendix 3 is a review of methods for
      assessing infant health and development.

TI  - The distribution of body mass index among individuals with and without
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the
      distributions of body mass index (BMI: kg/m2) among individuals with and without 
      schizophrenia, and, thereby, place the weight gain-inducing effects of
      antipsychotic drugs into context. METHOD: Data sources were (1) the mental health
      supplement of the 1989 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; N = 80,130
      nonschizophrenic and 150 self-reported schizophrenic individuals), (2) baseline
      BMI data from a drug trial of the anti-psychotic ziprasidone supplied by Pfizer
      Inc (420 noninstitutionalized individuals with chronic psychotic disorders
      [DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder]) and (3) data from the
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III; N = 17,689
      nonschizophrenic individuals) to act as a control group for the ziprasidone trial
      data. RESULTS: After age-adjusting BMI in each data set, the NHIS data revealed
      that men with schizophrenia have mean BMIs similar to those of men without
      schizophrenia (26.14 vs. 25.63, respectively). In contrast, women with
      schizophrenia in the NHIS data set had a significantly (p<.001) higher mean BMI
      than did women without schizophrenia (27.36 vs. 24.50, respectively). Moreover,
      each decile was higher for women with schizophrenia than for women without
      schizophrenia. Analysis of the ziprasidone and NHANES III data sets revealed
      that, on average, men with schizophrenia have mean BMIs comparable to those of
      men without schizophrenia (26.79 vs. 26.52, respectively). In these 2 data sets, 
      women with schizophrenia also had a mean BMI similar to those of women without
      schizophrenia (27.29 vs. 27.39, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although there may be 
      a small subpopulation of schizophrenic individuals who are underweight,
      individuals with schizophrenia were, on the whole, as obese as or more obese than
      individuals without schizophrenia, suggesting that weight gain induced by
      antipsychotic agents is an important concern for many individuals.

AB  - In recent years the efficacy of new antipsychotics has been investigated through 
      a number of randomized controlled trials. This paper considers some
      methodological flaws that affect these studies and proposes possible solutions.
      The final goal is the implementation of a new generation of trials with the aim
      of demonstrating superiority of effect of the new antipsychotic over the
      reference one.

TI  - Schizophrenia and the serotonin-2A receptor promoter polymorphism.
PG  - 221-4
AB  - Serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptors have received much investigative attention in
      schizophrenia because (1) several studies have shown a decrease in the number of 
      5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex of postmortem brains of schizophrenic
      patients; (2) atypical antipsychotic drugs are antagonists for 5-HT2A receptors; 
      and (3) a positive association between a T to C polymorphism at position 102 of
      the 5-HT2A receptor gene and schizophrenia has been reported. A G to A
      polymorphism at position -1438 of the 5-HT2A receptor gene was studied in 119
      schizophrenic patients and 106 healthy control subjects, all of whom were
      Japanese. The genotype and allele frequencies did not differ between the patients
      and control subjects. Furthermore, the genotype frequency did not differ
      according to diagnostic subtype, family history, age at onset of illness, or
      daily dosage of antipsychotic medication. Our results suggest that the
      polymorphism does not contribute to the etiology or clinical characteristics of
      schizophrenia. However, the gene is greater than 20 kbp in length, and thus it is
      possible that other areas that affect expression of the gene may vary. We found
      that the -1438G/A variant was in linkage disequilibrium with the T102C
      polymorphism.

TI  - Randomised double-blind comparison of the incidence of tardive dyskinesia in
      patients with schizophrenia during long-term treatment with olanzapine or
      haloperidol.
PG  - 23-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tardive dyskinesia is important in the side-effect profile of
      antipsychotic medication. AIMS: The development of tardive dyskinesia was
      evaluated in patients treated with double-blind, randomly assigned olanzapine or 
      haloperidol for up to 2.6 years. METHODS: Tardive dyskinesia was assessed by the 
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and Research Diagnostic Criteria for
      Tardive Dyskinesia (RD-TD), it was defined as meeting RD-TD criteria at two
      consecutive assessments. The risk of tardive dyskinesia, the relative risk,
      incidence rate, and incidence rate ratio were estimated. RESULTS: The relative
      risk of tardive dyskinesia for the overall follow up period for haloperidol (n = 
      522) v. olanzapine (n = 1192) was 2.66 (95% CI = 1.50-4.70). Based on data
      following the initial six weeks of observation (during which patients underwent
      medication change and AIMS assessments as frequently as every three days), the
      one-year risk was 0.52% with olanzapine (n = 513) and 7.45% with haloperidol (n =
      114). The relative risk throughout this follow-up period was 11.37 (95% CI =
      2.21-58.60). CONCLUSION: Our results indicated a significantly lower risk of
      tardive dyskinesia with olanzapine than with haloperidol.

AB  - Since the introduction of the Back to Sleep Campaigns, there has been a dramatic 
      reduction in sudden infant death syndrome in this country. Steven Blatt and
      Victoria Meguid review the literature surrounding sleep position. Investigators
      have continued efforts to find other modifiable risk factors of sudden infant
      death syndrome. A prospective study of more than 33,000 neonates found a link
      between a prolonged QT electrocardiogram interval and sudden infant death
      syndrome. Also discussed are investigations seeking to explain the relationship
      between smoking and sudden infant death syndrome. Ann Botash, Florence Jean-Louis
      and Mongkae Ploy Siripornsawan review the latest thinking on genital warts and
      their relation to specific viral etiologies and child sexual abuse. Other
      symptoms and signs of sexual abuse are the focus of a number of articles that can
      help the practitioner care for these unfortunate children. Catherine Church
      reviews medication options for children diagnosed with pervasive developmental
      disorders or autism spectrum disorders. Finally, in this article, risperidone,
      fluoxetine and naltrexone are reviewed.

TI  - Improvement of schizophrenic patients with primary negative symptoms treated with
      amisulpride. Amisulpride Study Group.
PG  - 610-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of low doses of amisulpride, an atypical antipsychotic of the
      benzamide class with high affinity for D2 and D3 dopamine receptors, in the
      treatment of schizophrenic patients with predominantly primary negative symptoms.
      METHOD: After completion of a 4-week washout period, schizophrenic patients with 
      primary negative symptoms participated in a 12-week, multicenter double-blind
      trial of placebo (N = 83), amisulpride, 50 mg/day (N = 84), or amisulpride, 100
      mg/day (N = 75). They were evaluated with the Scale for the Assessment of
      Negative Symptoms, the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale.
      RESULTS: Both amisulpride treatment groups showed significantly greater
      improvement in negative symptoms than the placebo group. Positive symptom scores 
      were low at baseline and changed minimally during the study, suggesting that the 
      improvement in negative symptoms was independent of improvement in positive
      symptoms. The safety of amisulpride was comparable to that of placebo, and
      extrapyramidal symptoms were infrequent. Comparable efficacy and safety results
      were observed with either dose of amisulpride. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
      confirm and extend those of earlier placebo-controlled studies of low-dose
      amisulpride in the treatment of patients with predominantly negative symptoms of 
      schizophrenia.

      severity of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) associated with treatment in patients
      with chronic schizophrenia. Factors associated with maximum EPS severity were
      increasing risperidone dose (< or = 8 mg/day was similar to placebo), lower
      baseline EPS scores, and longer duration of psychotic symptoms, particularly in
      older patients. EPS severity was significantly greater in patients receiving
      haloperidol or other antipsychotics than in those receiving risperidone (4 to 8
      mg/day) or placebo. Antiparkinsonian medications were required by significantly
      fewer patients treated with risperidone (4 to 8 mg/day) than by patients treated 
      with haloperidol or other antipsychotics. Combined efficacy data showed that 4 to
      8 mg/day was also the most efficacious dose range; there was no increase in
      efficacy with doses over 4 mg/day. Based on these data and post-marketing
      experience, 4 mg/day is an appropriate initial target dose for most patients with
      schizophrenia. Higher doses may be appropriate for patients with chronic illness,
      and lower doses may be appropriate for patients with a first psychotic episode or
      for elderly patients.

TI  - No evidence for association of serotonin-2A receptor variant (102T/C) with
      schizophrenia or clozapine response in a Chinese population.
PG  - 57-60
AB  - The serotonin hypothesis in schizophrenia had regained interest with the superior
      efficacy of clozapine in the refractory schizophrenic patients. Among the
      serotonin receptors, the serotonin 2A (5HT2A) receptor subtype is the most widely
      studied. Previous studies on the association between a silent mutation
      polymorphism of the 5HT2A gene (102T/C) and schizophrenia or clozapine response
      have yielded conflicting findings. Therefore, we investigated whether these
      genetic variants of the 5HT2A receptor are associated with schizophrenia or with 
      response to clozapine treatment in a Chinese population. Ninety-seven
      schizophrenic patients and 101 control subjects were included in the study. The
      receptor variants were found at similar frequencies in schizophrenic patients and
      healthy control subjects. Also, we did not find the variants to influence the
      response to clozapine in schizophrenic patients. We suggest that the assessment
      method of clozapine response and the ethnicity may influence the result.

TI  - Predictors of relapse following response from a first episode of schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined relapse after response to a first episode of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. METHODS: Patients with first-episode
      schizophrenia were assessed on measures of psychopathologic variables, cognition,
      social functioning, and biological variables and treated according to a
      standardized algorithm. The sample for the relapse analyses consisted of 104
      patients who responded to treatment of their index episode and were at risk for
      relapse. RESULTS: Five years after initial recovery, the cumulative first relapse
      rate was 81.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.6%-93.2%); the second relapse
      rate was 78.0% (95% CI, 46.5%-100.0%). By 4 years after recovery from a second
      relapse, the cumulative third relapse rate was 86.2% (95% CI, 61.5%-100.0%).
      Discontinuing antipsychotic drug therapy increased the risk of relapse by almost 
      5 times (hazard ratio for an initial relapse, 4.89 [99% CI, 2.49-9.60]; hazard
      ratio for a second relapse, 4.57 [99% CI, 1.49-14.02]). Subsequent analyses
      controlling for antipsychotic drug use showed that patients with poor premorbid
      adaptation to school and premorbid social withdrawal relapsed earlier. Sex,
      diagnosis, obstetric complications, duration of psychotic illness before
      treatment, baseline symptoms, neuroendocrine measures, methylphenidate
      hydrochloride challenge response, neuropsychologic and magnetic resonance imaging
      measures, time to response of the initial episode, adverse effects during
      treatment, and presence of residual symptoms after the initial episode were not
      significantly related to time to relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high rate of
      relapse within 5 years of recovery from a first episode of schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder. This risk is diminished by maintenance antipsychotic
      drug treatment.

TI  - Errorless learning and the cognitive rehabilitation of memory-impaired
      schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 105-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, evidence has accumulated that a significant
      proportion of schizophrenic patients have severe memory impairment, which cannot 
      be attributed to the effects of medication, chronicity or institutionalization.
      Our group has demonstrated that memory impairment is associated with poor
      psychosocial outcome and treatment resistance. Work on the classical amnesic
      syndrome has suggested that memory training is facilitated by adopting an
      'errorless learning' approach, where subjects do not experience failure during
      learning. This is based on the theory that the preserved implicit memory of
      amnesic patients results in implicitly remembered incorrect responses interfering
      with target items, in the absence of a functioning explicit memory system to
      allow differentiation. METHOD: We compared three groups of subjects,
      memory-impaired schizophrenic patients, memory unimpaired schizophrenic patients 
      and healthy controls. RESULTS: An errorless learning approach conferred a
      significant advantage on the memory-impaired schizophrenic group, bringing their 
      performance up to the level of both control groups. In contrast, adopting a
      traditional trial and error, or errorful approach resulted in markedly impaired
      performance in the memory-impaired schizophrenic group only. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that errorless learning approaches may be worthy of further evaluation
      in the cognitive rehabilitation of memory-impaired schizophrenic patients.

TI  - Comparison of risperidone and mosapramine addition to neuroleptic treatment in
      chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 81-5
AB  - There is little information regarding the effects of risperidone addition to
      neuroleptic treatment in chronic schizophrenia. As a preliminary study, 10
      neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic inpatients received risperidone (high 5HT2A/D2 
      ratio, i.e. the ratio between 5HT2A and D2 receptor occupancy) and mosapramine
      (low 5HT2A/D2 ratio) in a randomized, single-blind, crossover, add-on study
      consisting of 8 weeks of treatment each with risperidone and mosapramine.
      Although both additions resulted in significant, albeit modest, improvement,
      there was no significant difference in the scores on the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia between risperidone and mosapramine addition.
      These results suggest that risperidone and mosapramine bring about comparable
      effects in add-on design. Thus, risperidone with a high 5HT2A/D2 ratio does not
      seem to be better than mosapramine with a low 5HT2A/D2 ratio when combined with
      conventional neuroleptics. Further studies including a large number of patients
      and a double-blind design are needed.

TI  - Low-dose clozapine for the treatment of drug-induced psychosis in Parkinson's
      disease. The Parkinson Study Group.
PG  - 757-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-induced psychosis is a difficult problem to manage in patients
      with Parkinson's disease. Multiple open-label studies have reported that
      treatment with clozapine at low doses ameliorates psychosis without worsening
      parkinsonism. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of low doses of clozapine (6.25 to 50 mg per day) in 60 
      patients at six sites over a period of 14 months. The patients (mean age, 72
      years) had idiopathic Parkinson's disease and drug-induced psychosis of at least 
      four weeks' duration. All the patients continued to receive fixed doses of
      antiparkinsonian drugs during the four weeks of the trial. Blood counts were
      monitored weekly in all the patients. RESULTS: The mean dose of clozapine was
      24.7 mg per day. The patients in the clozapine group had significantly more
      improvement than those in the placebo group in all three of the measures used to 
      determine the severity of psychosis. The mean (+/-SE) scores on the Clinical
      Global Impression Scale improved by 1.6+/-0.3 points for the patients receiving
      clozapine, as compared with 0.5+/-0.2 point for those receiving placebo
      (P<0.001). The score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale improved by 9.3+/-1.5 
      points for the patients receiving clozapine, as compared with 2.6+/-1.3 points
      for those receiving placebo (P=0.002). The score on the Scale for the Assessment 
      of Positive Symptoms improved by 11.8+/-2.0 points for the patients receiving
      clozapine, as compared with 3.8+/-1.9 points for those receiving placebo
      (P=0.01). Seven patients treated with clozapine had an improvement of at least
      three on the seven-point Clinical Global Impression Scale, as compared with only 
      one patient given placebo. Clozapine treatment improved tremor and had no
      deleterious effect on the severity of parkinsonism. In one patient, clozapine was
      discontinued because of leukopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine, at daily doses of 50 
      mg or less, is safe and significantly improves drug-induced psychosis without
      worsening parkinsonism.

TI  - A placebo-controlled crossover trial of D-cycloserine added to clozapine in
      patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 512-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: D-Cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine recognition site of
      the NMDA receptor, has previously been shown to improve negative symptoms when
      added to conventional antipsychotics and, in one preliminary dose-finding study, 
      worsened negative symptoms when added to clozapine. METHODS: Seventeen
      schizophrenia outpatients treated with clozapine were assigned in random order to
      6-week trials of D-cycloserine 50 mg/day and placebo in a crossover design
      separated by a 1 week placebo washout. RESULTS: Eleven patients competed the
      13-week study. D-Cycloserine significantly worsened ratings of negative symptoms 
      compared to placebo but did not significantly affect ratings of psychotic
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The differing effects of D-cycloserine on negative
      symptoms when added to clozapine compared to conventional antipsychotics suggests
      that activation of the glycine recognition site may play a role in clozapine's
      efficacy for negative symptoms.

TI  - Body weight and leptin plasma levels during treatment with antipsychotic drugs.
PG  - 312-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leptin is produced by fat cells and is presumed to signal the size of 
      the adipose tissue to the brain. The authors investigated whether antipsychotic
      drugs that often induce weight gain affect circulating levels of leptin. METHOD: 
      Weight, body mass index, and leptin plasma level were measured weekly over 4
      weeks in psychiatric inpatients who received clozapine (N = 11), olanzapine (N = 
      8), haloperidol (N = 13), or no psychopharmacological treatment (N = 12).
      RESULTS: In patients receiving clozapine or olanzapine, significant increases in 
      weight, body mass index, and leptin level were found, whereas these measures
      remained stable in patients who received haloperidol or no pharmacological
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Weight gain induced by clozapine or olanzapine appears to
      be associated with an increase in leptin level that cannot be attributed to
      dietary changes upon hospitalization.

TI  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder in schizophrenia: epidemiologic and biologic
      overlap.
PG  - 15-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the co-existence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
      with schizophrenia in terms of epidemiology and overlapping biologic substrates. 
      METHODS: Review of the relevant literature. RESULTS: There appears to be a
      significant prevalence of OCD in schizophrenia--higher than what would be
      expected on the basis of calculated comorbidity figures. There is significant
      overlap in the proposed functional circuits of OCD and schizophrenia, which may
      lead to co-expression of symptoms. Although there is overlap in neurotransmitter 
      dysfunction, the interactions are complex, especially in regard to the serotonin 
      and dopamine systems. CONCLUSION: The expression of OCD in schizophrenia is
      complex but very intriguing. Theoretical hypotheses of the pathology of the 2
      disorders now need to be tested in larger controlled trials.

TI  - Prolactin levels and adverse events in patients treated with risperidone.
PG  - 57-61
AB  - Hyperprolactinemia is a common clinical disorder that may lead to sexual
      dysfunction or galactorrhea. It may arise from a variety of etiologies, including
      the use of antipsychotic agents, presumably because of a dopamine receptor
      blockade. This analysis was designed to characterize the relationship between
      risperidone, serum prolactin levels, and possible clinical sequelae. All data
      from randomized, double-blind studies of risperidone in patients with chronic
      schizophrenia were analyzed. The two largest studies (the North American and
      multinational trials) included 841 patients (259 women, 582 men) with paired
      prolactin level data and 1,884 patients (554 women, 1,330 men) with data on six
      adverse events possibly associated with increased prolactin levels (amenorrhea,
      galactorrhea, and decreased libido in women; erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory
      dysfunction, gynecomastia, and decreased libido in men). Both risperidone and
      haloperidol produced dose-related increases in plasma prolactin levels in men and
      women. Among women, the risperidone dose was not correlated with adverse events, 
      nor were the adverse events correlated with endpoint prolactin levels. Among men,
      the incidence of adverse events was positively correlated with risperidone dose; 
      however, at risperidone doses of 4 to 10 mg/day the incidence of adverse events
      was not significantly higher than that observed in patients receiving placebo.
      Furthermore, adverse events in men were unrelated to plasma prolactin levels.
      Risperidone-associated increase in serum prolactin levels was not significantly
      correlated to the emergence of possible prolactin-related side effects.

TI  - Combination treatment with clozapine and paroxetine in schizophrenia: safety and 
      tolerability data from a prospective open clinical trial.
PG  - 315-20
AB  - Clozapine is a drug with many side effects, some of them with potentially
      hazardous outcome (e.g. seizures, agranulocytosis), if not carefully monitored.
      It has been shown that the metabolism of clozapine may be affected by concomitant
      treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), while there have 
      been reports of improved efficacy on negative symptomatology of clozapine in
      combination with SSRIs. Therefore, this prospective open clinical trial was
      performed to investigate the safety and tolerability of the coadministration of
      clozapine and paroxetine under control of serum concentrations of clozapine and
      its metabolites and the effect of this combination treatment on
      psychopathological outcome was evaluated. A total of 14 patients suffering from
      schizophrenia or schizodepressive disorder with predominant negative
      symptomatology were included. The duration of the study was at least 6 weeks for 
      each patient. Initial treatment was a monotherapy with clozapine at a daily dose 
      of 2.5 mg/kg weight. After two measurements of serum concentrations of clozapine 
      and metabolites during steady state conditions, an add-on therapy with 20 mg
      paroxetine was initiated. No concomitant medication was allowed. The main finding
      of our prospective study was that addition of paroxetine to a monotherapy with
      clozapine was a well tolerated medication that did not give rise to new
      clinically relevant side effects. After addition of paroxetine the serum
      concentrations of clozapine and its major metabolites remained virtually
      constant. The results of the psychopathological measurements indicated a further 
      clinical improvement, although the small open study could not test for efficacy.

TI  - Schizophrenia: do we really need placebo-controlled studies?
PG  - 279-86
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether placebo control is necessary to prove efficacy 
      in short-term studies in schizophrenia. DESIGN: This study compares the efficacy 
      results of placebo-controlled studies versus positive controlled studies, that is
      controlled studies without a placebo control, in the short-term treatment of
      chronic schizophrenia. RESULTS: Concerning mean improvement on the BPRS, the
      placebo arms showed in two cases a worsening, in one case almost no change, and
      in the remaining studies (6) the improvement was between 1 and 5%. The percentage
      mean improvement in the haloperidol arms of the placebo-controlled studies was
      comparable to the percentage mean improvement in the corresponding arms of the
      non-placebo-controlled studies. The highest percentage responders in the
      placebo-groups was 43% and the lowest was 6%. Moreover the responder rates in the
      atypical antipsychotic and haloperidol arms of the non-placebo-controlled studies
      were, in two of the three studies, in the same order of magnitude as the
      responder rates of the placebo arms in the placebo-controlled studies. The
      overall dropout rates in the placebo arms was between 48% and 80% and were higher
      than the drop out rates in the atypical neuroleptic arms and haloperidol arms of 
      the placebo-controlled studies. The dropout rates due to an insufficient response
      in the atypical neuroleptic arms and haloperidol arms of the
      non-placebo-controlled studies were lower when compared to corresponding
      treatment arms of the placebo-controlled studies. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the 
      mean improvement on the BPRS, responder rates in the placebo arms varied
      considerably from study to study. Responder rates in the atypical antipsychotic
      and haloperidol arms of the non-placebo-controlled studies were, in two of the
      three studies, of the same order of magnitude as the responder rates of the
      placebo arms in the placebo-controlled studies. These results indicate that
      placebo control is necessary. Moreover as responders are a more clinically
      relevant outcome measure when compared to mean improvement on a rating scale,
      placebo-controlled studies are still needed. However, consensus on responder
      definition should be agreed upon. For the moment, alternatives to
      placebo-controlled studies are inadequate in demonstrating efficacy in studies
      with schizophrenic patients.

TI  - Use of atypical neuroleptics in child and adolescent psychiatry.
PG  - 644-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: This article reviews the published clinical experience with atypical 
      neuroleptics in children and adolescents. METHOD: A computerized literature
      search was conducted (MEDLINE, 1974-1998) to retrieve all reports on the use of
      atypical neuroleptics in children and adolescents. A hand search was performed as
      well. All relevant clinical data were collated by type of drug. RESULTS: We found
      5 blind placebo-controlled clinical trials (105 patients), 24 open-label clinical
      trials (387 patients), and 33 case series (115 patients) describing the use of
      the atypical neuroleptics clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, sulpiride,
      tiapride, amisulpride, remoxipride, and clothiapine in children and adolescents. 
      Some of these agents, especially clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, were
      found to be efficacious in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and
      pervasive developmental disorders. The role of atypical neuroleptics as
      augmenters of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in obsessive-compulsive disorder is
      unclear. Risperidone appears to possess anti-tic properties in patients with
      Tourette's disorder. CONCLUSION: The most convincing evidence of the efficacy of 
      atypical neuroleptics in children and adolescents concerns clozapine in the
      treatment of schizophrenia. Data on other atypical neuroleptics in other
      disorders are still sparse, and further research is needed. Some of the atypical 
      neuroleptics may become the first-line treatment for childhood schizophrenia and 
      pervasive developmental disorders.

TI  - Conventional vs. newer antipsychotics in elderly patients.
PG  - 70-6
AB  - Elderly patients with schizophrenia and dementia patients with agitation are
      frequently candidates for antipsychotic treatment. Conventional neuroleptics have
      relatively little effect on negative symptoms and may cause considerable side
      effects, especially in elderly patients. The authors have found a 29% cumulative 
      annual incidence of tardive dyskinesia (TD) in middle-aged and elderly
      outpatients treated with relatively low doses of conventional neuroleptics Newer 
      antipsychotics are less likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms and may be
      associated with a lower risk of TD. They are generally effective for both
      positive and negative symptoms and may also improve some aspects of cognition,
      but these drugs have their own side effects. Dosing requirements for elderly
      patients tend to be much lower than those for younger adults.

TI  - Pilot study with clozapine in patients with HIV-associated psychosis and
      drug-induced parkinsonism.
PG  - 128-31
AB  - Clozapine (CZP) is an atypical antipsychotic drug that does not appear to block
      striatal dopamine receptors. In six patients who met the criteria of
      HIV-associated psychosis and who had previously developed moderate parkinsonism
      as a result of the use of typical neuroleptic agents, CZP was added in an open,
      rising dose study. Subjects were evaluated at baseline after at least 7 days
      without neuroleptic drugs and then monthly for 3 months of the experimental
      treatment using three rating scales: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS),
      Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and motor examination of the Unified
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). A significant reduction in
      psychopathology as represented in the BPRS total score (54.2 at baseline versus
      23.9 at month 3) and CGI (2 and 8, respectively) was obtained with a mean CZP
      dose of 27.08 mg/day. Parkinsonism also improved by an average of 76.5% at the
      end of the study. One patient did not complete the study as a result of a
      progressive decrease in leukocyte count while on CZP. These preliminary results
      suggest that the pharmacologic properties of CZP may be of value in the
      management of HIV-psychotic patients.

AB  - This study compared the drug-utilization costs and indicators of clinical
      outcomes associated with the use of risperidone and olanzapine in a hospital
      setting. We conducted a nonrandomized, retrospective chart review of consecutive 
      patients identified as presenting with psychotic symptoms on inpatient wards at
      Riverview Hospital in British Columbia and given either risperidone or olanzapine
      as their first new drug after reassessment (n = 30 per treatment group). Data
      were collected for up to 120 days. No significant differences were observed
      between groups in terms of sex, age, duration of illness, or diagnosis. The mean 
      dosage of risperidone for responders was 4.89 +/- 2.56 mg/d, whereas that for
      olanzapine was 17.19 +/- 3.88 mg/d. The associated daily drug-acquisition costs
      were significantly different, at CA$4.69 for risperidone and CA$11.52 for
      olanzapine. Notes in patient charts indicated that a significantly greater
      proportion of risperidone-treated patients (60.0%) than olanzapine-treated
      patients (26.7%) responded to therapy, as indicated by improvement in at least
      one target symptom (P < 0.01). Forty percent of patients initially treated with
      risperidone were discharged on their original therapy, compared with 13.3% of
      patients treated with olanzapine (P < 0.05). These results were not substantially
      affected by correction for markers of illness severity or treatment resistance.
      Overall, no significant differences in side effects were recorded in the patient 
      records of the two groups. Within this cohort of patients, risperidone treatment 
      was associated with lower drug-acquisition cost and better treatment outcomes
      than olanzapine.

      schizophrenia.
PG  - 145-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The focus of this study was the systematic evaluation of the clinical 
      effects of glycine as an adjunct to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine in the
      treatment of schizophrenia. METHOD: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 
      19 patients with chronic, treatment-resistant schizophrenia who were maintained
      on optimal doses of clozapine (400-1200 mg/day) were administered either 30 g/day
      of glycine (N=9) or placebo (N=10) for 12 weeks. Clinical evaluations with the
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative
      Symptoms, and the Simpson-Angus movement scale were completed biweekly. RESULTS: 
      The use of glycine as an adjunct to clozapine was not effective in decreasing
      positive or negative symptoms. In contrast, the patients treated with clozapine
      without glycine had a 35% reduction in positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These
      preliminary data suggest that glycine may interfere with the antipsychotic
      efficacy of atypical neuroleptics such as clozapine.

TI  - Impact of clozapine on negative symptoms and on the deficit syndrome in
      refractory schizophrenia. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group 
      on Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia.
PG  - 88-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effect of clozapine and haloperidol on
      positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and in patients with high levels 
      of negative symptoms or the deficit syndrome. METHOD: Patients were participants 
      in a 15-site double-blind, random-assignment Veterans Administration trial
      comparing clozapine (N=205) and haloperidol (N=217) in hospitalized patients with
      refractory schizophrenia. Analysis of covariance examining change at 6 weeks, 3
      months, and 1 year evaluated 1) clozapine's effect on positive and negative
      syndromes; 2) clozapine's effect on each syndrome, statistically controlling for 
      the other; and 3) the interaction of clozapine treatment and the presence or
      absence of high levels of negative symptoms at baseline and the deficit syndrome.
      RESULTS: Patients treated with clozapine showed significantly greater improvement
      than control subjects on positive symptoms at all time points and on negative
      symptoms at 3 months. Clozapine had no independent effect on negative symptoms at
      any time after control for positive symptoms, but its effects on positive
      symptoms persisted after control for negative symptoms at 6 weeks only. There
      were no significant differences in response to clozapine between patients with
      high and low levels of negative symptoms at baseline or between patients with and
      without the deficit syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The greater effectiveness of clozapine
      as compared to conventional medications in refractory schizophrenia is not
      specific to either negative clinical symptoms or clinical subtypes defined by
      prominent negative symptoms or evidence of the deficit syndrome.

TI  - Mechanism of peripheral noradrenergic stimulation by clozapine.
PG  - 29-34
AB  - Elevated plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels is a relatively consistent clinical
      effect of clozapine. Plasma NE levels reflect an interplay of release, reuptake, 
      metabolism, and excretion. To explore the mechanism of clozapine-induced plasma
      NE elevation, we measured arterial plasma levels of NE and other catechols during
      intravenous infusion of tritium-labeled NE (3H-NE) in schizophrenic patients
      treated with clozapine, fluphenazine, or placebo. Clozapine-treated patients had 
      markedly higher levels of NE than did the patients treated with fluphenazine or
      placebo. NE spillover averaged more than three times higher in clozapine-treated 
      patients; whereas NE clearance did not differ among the groups. Production of
      3H-dihydroxyphenylglycol (3H-DHPG), a purely intraneuronal metabolite of 3H-NE in
      clozapine-treated patients was normal, indicating that clozapine did not affect
      neuronal uptake of NE. Because plasma levels of DHPG and dihydroxyphenylacetic
      acid (DOPAC), deaminated metabolites of catecholamines, in clozapine-treated
      patients were normal, clozapine also did not seem to inhibit intraneuronal
      monoamine oxidase (MAO). High plasma NE levels in clozapine-treated patients,
      therefore, resulted from increased NE spillover rather than decreased reuptake,
      metabolism, or clearance.

TI  - The antipsychotics. A pediatric perspective.
PG  - 1205-32
AB  - As can be discerned from this article, antipsychotics are commonly prescribed,
      and they are not used to treat only psychosis. Although some data support the use
      of typical antipsychotics in pediatric patients with a variety of psychiatric
      syndromes, concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents often
      complicated their use and probably even interfered with case identification. A
      fundamentally new group of medications, the atypicals, have now become available 
      and may not only have improved tolerability but also may have greater ability to 
      reduce some target symptoms. Because of their superior side-effect profile in
      adults, some of these atypical treatments probably will be commonly prescribed
      despite a relative paucity of data about their use in the young. Moreover,
      although frequently prescribed in this age group, the overall prescription rate
      for antipsychotics will probably increase because of the putative improved safety
      profile of the newer agents. However, it is possible that serious side effects,
      such as tardive dyskinesia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, may occur with
      these atypical agents. For this reason, the enthusiasm for prescribing these
      newer treatments should be tempered with the understanding that these agents,
      although they may in some ways be superior to their predecessors, still possess
      the potential for significant adverse events. Four atypical antipsychotics are
      currently marketed in the United States (see Table 2). One additional agent,
      ziprasodone, is undergoing clinical investigation. Ziprasodone has been shown to 
      be superior to placebo in adults suffering from schizophrenia. Ziprasodone will
      probably be marketed in the United States in the near future. Whether all of
      these atypical drugs will have a place in the clinical armamentarium of the
      pediatric psychopharmacologist remains to be determined. Because the receptor
      binding profile of the atypical agents differ, it is not possible to assume that 
      what is true for one of these agents is true for the others. Although results
      from most preliminary studies with atypical antipsychotics indicate that these
      are promising agents for pediatric patients, further research is needed to define
      just how these medications may be most judiciously used.

TI  - Psilocybin induces schizophrenia-like psychosis in humans via a serotonin-2
      agonist action.
PG  - 3897-902
AB  - Psilocybin, an indoleamine hallucinogen, produces a psychosis-like syndrome in
      humans that resembles first episodes of schizophrenia. In healthy human
      volunteers, the psychotomimetic effects of psilocybin were blocked
      dose-dependently by the serotonin-2A antagonist ketanserin or the atypical
      antipsychotic risperidone, but were increased by the dopamine antagonist and
      typical antipsychotic haloperidol. These data are consistent with animal studies 
      and provide the first evidence in humans that psilocybin-induced psychosis is due
      to serotonin-2A receptor activation, independently of dopamine stimulation. Thus,
      serotonin-2A overactivity may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia
      and serotonin-2A antagonism may contribute to therapeutic effects of
      antipsychotics.

      and cost data, concerning 423 patients with refractory schizophrenia who had been
      hospitalized for 30-364 days during the year before study entry, at 15 VA medical
      centers. STUDY DESIGN: A 12-month double-blind trial compared clozapine (n = 205)
      and haloperidol (n = 218) in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. DATA
      COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data from standard assessment instruments,
      gathered at baseline and at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, were used to 
      develop a Composite Health Index for Schizophrenia, a measure that addresses
      outcome in six domains, weighted by patient or provider preferences. Cumulative
      improvement was estimated by computing the area under the improvement curve. This
      measure was then combined with cost data, reflecting consumption of societal
      resources to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      Clozapine was significantly more effective than haloperidol on measures of
      symptoms (p = .02) and side effects (p < .0001), with nonsignificant trends in
      the positive direction on community role functioning (p = .06), family
      relationships (p = .23), social relationships (p = .30), and daily activities (p 
      = .20). Clozapine was also more effective than haloperidol on the one-year
      cumulative Composite Health Index for Schizophrenia (p < .0001 for all weighting 
      schemes). After converting this measure to a 0-1 Worst Health-Good Health Scale
      analogous to Quality Adjusted Life Years, clozapine was found to yield a small
      improvement of .049 Worst Health-Good Health Units as compared to an improvement 
      of only .027 Units for haloperidol (p < .0001). Average annual costs were $2,733 
      lower for clozapine (95% C.I. = -$9,220 to $3,754). Although clozapine was
      significantly more effective than haloperidol, the summary cost-effectiveness
      ratio had a wide 95 percent confidence interval ranging from -$431,585 to
      $177,352. CONCLUSIONS: Methods demonstrate an approach to using conventional
      disease-specific measures to evaluate the cumulative effectiveness of novel
      treatments for psychotic disorders and for expressing their economic effect as
      cost-effectiveness ratios. Among high hospital users with refractory
      schizophrenia, clozapine is more cost-effective than standard treatment, although
      the magnitude of its effect is small and there is considerable uncertainty about 
      the cost estimates.

TI  - Switching from clozapine to olanzapine in treatment-refractory schizophrenia:
      safety, clinical efficacy, and predictors of response.
PG  - 585-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our experience, many of our schizophrenic patients treated with
      clozapine request the newer atypical antipsychotic agents in order to eliminate
      the weekly blood monitoring. However, there are few guidelines available to
      clinicians interested in switching patients successfully treated with clozapine
      to olanzapine. METHOD: The goal of this study was to collect preliminary data on 
      the safety, clinical effectiveness, and predictors of response of switching
      clozapine patients to olanzapine. In an open trial, 19 patients receiving
      clozapine were switched to olanzapine. RESULTS: Eight (42%) of 19 patients were
      considered responders. Seven patients decompensated seriously enough to require
      hospitalization. All 7 of these patients were restabilized on clozapine treatment
      in the hospital, and olanzapine was discontinued. In an additional 4 patients,
      clinical status worsened, and clozapine doses were titrated upwards and
      olanzapine was slowly discontinued. Overall, mean total Brief Psychiatric Rating 
      Scale (BPRS) scores increased significantly from baseline to final assessment (p 
      = .02). Responders had been treated for a significantly shorter period of time
      with clozapine prior to the switch compared to nonresponders (p = .04) and were
      receiving a lower dose of clozapine (p = .05). The final olanzapine dose did not 
      differ between responders and nonresponders. All responders have remained on
      olanzapine treatment and are stable. CONCLUSION: In this open trial, the
      crossover from clozapine to olanzapine was generally well tolerated and resulted 
      in a successful transition for 8 of the 19 patients. However, mean scores on the 
      total BPRS and negative symptom and depressive symptom subscales significantly
      increased. Caution must be taken in determining which patients may benefit from
      the switch to olanzapine because of the risk of decompensation and
      hospitalization. Because this was an open trial, these findings require
      replication in a controlled trial.

TI  - Elevated serum creatine kinase activity in adolescent psychiatric inpatients on
      admission.
PG  - 269-72
AB  - Studies in adults have indicated a significant relationship between high serum
      creatine kinase levels on admission and acute psychosis. However, data on
      children are sparse. The files of 183 hospitalized children and adolescents (93
      boys, 90 girls) with severe psychiatric disorders were reviewed for serum
      creatine kinase activity on admission, psychomotor agitation, Clinical Global
      Impression Score, need for intramuscular injection, number of neuroleptic
      medications and presence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Serum creatine kinase
      levels > 201 IU/ml were considered abnormal. Boys had significantly higher
      creatine kinase activity than girls. Division of the cohort by diagnosis yielded 
      significantly higher levels in those with schizophrenia, affective disorders and 
      mental retardation. Higher levels were also associated with higher Clinical
      Global Impression score on admission, use of injections and physical restraint,
      and nonresponse to neuroleptic medication. There were no cases of neuroleptic
      malignant syndrome. This first large-scale investigation of serum creatine kinase
      activity in young psychiatric inpatients shows a significant association between 
      high creatine kinase activity and acute psychosis, similar to that in adults.
      Furthermore, high creatine kinase levels on admission are predictive of the
      severity of the psychosis, but are not associated with neuroleptic malignant
      syndrome. Because psychotic adolescents with high admission creatine kinase
      levels tend to be nonresponders, clinicians should consider the early use of
      atypical antipsychotics in this subgroup.

TI  - Risperidone and olanzapine: optimal dosing for efficacy and tolerability in
      patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 253-62
AB  - Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating disorder whose effective
      pharmacological management is often less than optimal. For several decades,
      pharmaceutical treatment for this disorder consisted of conventional neuroleptics
      such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine. However, the limitations of these drugs
      have driven the development of newer antipsychotics that are designed to be more 
      efficacious and more tolerable than conventional agents. Newer agents available
      for consideration as first-line treatment options now include risperidone,
      olanzapine, sertindole and, more recently, quetiapine. Proper dosing has emerged 
      as a vital factor in the effective use of these newer drugs. This report examines
      data derived from clinical trials and market research with risperidone and
      olanzapine to help clinicians determine the appropriate dose for efficacy and to 
      appraise the adverse events associated with that efficacious dose. Current
      information suggests that, for most patients with schizophrenia, the optimal dose
      with respect to efficacy and tolerability of risperidone is < or = 6 mg/day. The 
      optimal dose of olanzapine is less clear and may be 15 mg/day or higher. With the
      advent of these newer antipsychotics, clinicians now have more treatment options 
      for the management of patients with psychotic disorders. Knowledge gained through
      clinical experience is needed to augment clinical trial results and to help
      define the most effective use of each of these agents.

TI  - A pharmacokinetic interaction between carbamazepine and olanzapine: observations 
      on possible mechanism.
PG  - 639-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic, which is effective against both
      the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and causes fewer
      extrapyramidal adverse effects than conventional antipsychotics. The purpose of
      the present study was to assess the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction
      between olanzapine and carbamazepine, since these agents are likely to be used
      concomitantly in the treatment of manic psychotic disorder. METHOD: The
      pharmacokinetics of two single therapeutic doses of olanzapine were determined in
      11 healthy volunteers. The first dose of olanzapine (10 mg) was taken alone and
      the second dose (10 mg) after 2 weeks of treatment with carbamazepine (200 mg
      BID). Measurement of urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol excretion was used as
      an endogenous marker to confirm that induction of CYP3A4 by carbamazepine had
      occurred. RESULTS: The dose of olanzapine given after a 2-week pretreatment with 
      carbamazepine was cleared more rapidly than olanzapine given alone. Olanzapine
      pharmacokinetic values for Cmax and AUC were significantly lower after the second
      dose, the elimination half-life was significantly shorter, and the clearance and 
      volume of distribution were significantly increased. CONCLUSION: Carbamazepine
      has been shown to induce several P450 cytochromes including CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.
      Since CYP1A2 plays a role in the metabolic clearance of olanzapine, the
      interaction may be attributed to induction of CYP1A2 by carbamazepine, leading to
      increased first-pass and systemic metabolism of olanzapine. The interaction is
      not considered to be of clinical significance because olanzapine has a wide
      therapeutic index, and the changes in plasma concentration of olanzapine are
      within the fourfold variation that occurs without concern for safety in a patient
      population.

TI  - [Significance of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes for psychopharmacology].
PG  - 944-55
AB  - Nearly all psychotropic drugs are metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450-enzymes.
      In humans, there are 5 isoenzymes involved in this process. The activity of these
      enzymes can be modulated by a number of commonly used drugs, yielding potentially
      hazardous interactions. Most of the recently introduced selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors are potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Thus, the
      plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants or clozapine might be elevated
      into toxic levels. In contrast, carbamazepine induces most of the isoenzymes.
      This potentiates the elimination of tricyclics and antipsychotics and might cause
      a serious risk for the recurrence of depressive or psychotic symptoms. Moreover, 
      5-10% of the population are slow metabolizers of CYP2D6. This group is prone to
      increased adverse effects of moderately dosed medication. This review
      systematically points out the reported or predicted pharmacokinetic drug
      interactions in psychopharmacology focussing on clinical significance.

TI  - Lack of effect of olanzapine on the pharmacokinetics of a single aminophylline
      dose in healthy men.
PG  - 1237-48
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To test whether olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is an
      inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 activity, we conducted a drug interaction 
      study with theophylline, a known CYP1A2 substrate. DESIGN: Two-way, randomized,
      crossover study. SETTING: Clinical research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Nineteen
      healthy males (16 smokers, 3 nonsmokers). INTERVENTIONS: Because the a priori
      expectation was no effect of olanzapine on theophylline pharmacokinetics, a
      parallel study using cimetidine was included as a positive control. In group 1,
      12 healthy subjects received a 30-minute intravenous infusion of aminophylline
      350 mg after 9 consecutive days of either olanzapine or placebo. In group 2,
      seven healthy subjects received a similar aminophylline infusion after 9
      consecutive days of either cimetidine or placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
      Concentrations of theophylline and its metabolites in serum and urine were
      measured for 24 and 72 hours, respectively. Plasma concentrations of olanzapine
      and its metabolites were measured for 24 hours after the next to last dose and
      168 hours after the last olanzapine dose. Olanzapine did not affect theophylline 
      pharmacokinetics. However, cimetidine significantly decreased theophylline
      clearance and the corresponding formation of its metabolites. Urinary excretion
      of theophylline and its metabolites was unaffected by olanzapine but was reduced 
      significantly by cimetidine. Steady-state concentrations of olanzapine (15.3
      ng/ml), 10-N-glucuronide (4.9 ng/ml), and 4'-N-desmethyl olanzapine (2.5 ng/ml)
      were observed after olanzapine 10 mg once/day and were unaffected by
      coadministration of theophylline. CONCLUSION: As predicted by in vitro studies,
      steady-state concentrations of olanzapine and its metabolites did not affect
      theophylline pharmacokinetics and should not affect the pharmacokinetics of other
      agents metabolized by the CYP1A2 isozyme.

TI  - London-east Anglia randomised controlled trial of cognitive-behavioural therapy
      for psychosis. III: Follow-up and economic evaluation at 18 months.
PG  - 61-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: A randomised controlled trial of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) 
      for people with medication-resistant psychosis showed improvements in overall
      symptomatology after nine months of treatment; good outcome was strongly
      predicted by a measure of cognitive flexibility concerning delusions. The present
      paper presents a follow-up evaluation 18 months after baseline. METHOD:
      Forty-seven (78% of original n = 60) participants were available for follow-up at
      18 months, and were reassessed on all the original outcome measures (see Part I).
      An economic evaluation was also completed. RESULTS: Those in the CBT treatment
      group showed a significant and continuing improvement in Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale scores, whereas the control group did not change from baseline. Delusional 
      distress and the frequency of hallucinations were also significantly reduced in
      the CBT group. The costs of CBT appear to have been offset by reductions in
      service utilisation and associated costs during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:
      Improvement in overall symptoms was maintained in the CBT group 18 months after
      baseline and nine months after intensive therapy was completed. CBT may be a
      specific and cost-effective intervention in medication-resistant psychosis.

TI  - D-serine added to antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 1081-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype glutamate
      receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. D-serine is
      a full agonist of the glycine site of NMDA receptor, an endogenous cotransmitter 
      enriched in corticolimbic regions and distributed in parallel with NMDA receptor.
      Supplementation of D-serine may improve the symptoms of schizophrenia. METHODS:
      Thirty-one Taiwanese schizophrenic patients enrolled in a 6-week double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of D-serine (30 mg/kg/day), which was added to their
      stable antipsychotic regimens. Of these, 28 completed the trial. Measures of
      clinical efficacy, side effects, and serum levels of amino acids and D-serine
      were determined every other week. Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) was
      performed at the beginning and end of the trial. RESULTS: Patients who received
      D-serine treatment revealed significant improvements in their positive, negative,
      and cognitive symptoms as well as some performance in WCST. D-serine levels at
      week 4 and 6 significantly predicted the improvements. D-serine was well
      tolerated and no significant side effects were noted. CONCLUSIONS: The
      significant improvement with the D-serine further supports the hypothesis of NMDA
      receptor hypofunction in schizophrenia. Given the effects of D-serine on positive
      symptoms, a trial of D-serine alone in schizophrenia should be considered.

TI  - D2-dopamine receptor occupancy measured by IBZM-SPECT in relation to

PG  - 159-62
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare striatal D2 dopamine receptor occupancy 
      of various typical neuroleptics and clozapine in relation to the occurrence of
      extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Forty-four inpatients with schizophrenia,
      including 12 patients with schizodominant schizoaffective disorder, were
      evaluated using 123I-iodobenzamide (IBZM) and single photon emission computed
      tomography. Striatal D2 dopamine receptor occupancy was estimated by use of a
      striatal/frontal cortex ratio (ST/FC) of IBZM binding. Fourteen patients were
      neuroleptic-free and served as controls. Six patients were treated with clozapine
      and 24 patients were treated with various typical neuroleptics. ST/FC ratios in
      patients taking typical neuroleptics were significantly lower than those who were
      neuroleptic free or treated with clozapine. Patients with EPS had lower ST/FC
      ratios than those without EPS. A significant linear relationship between ST/FC
      ratios and severity of EPS estimated by the Simpson-Angus-Scale was established
      (r=-0.51, p=0.041).

TI  - P50 suppression in recent-onset schizophrenia: clinical correlates and
      risperidone effects.
PG  - 691-8
AB  - Chronic schizophrenic patients often do not suppress the auditory P50 component
      of the event-related potential to the second of 2 clicks, presented 500 ms apart,
      suggesting a loss of normal inhibition. This study attempted to replicate the P50
      suppression deficit in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and to examine
      whether P50 is related to clinical symptoms or is affected by an atypical
      antipsychotic medication. Data from 22 recent-onset schizophrenia patients and 11
      normal controls revealed that disruption in P50 suppression is present during the
      early stages of illness. In addition, impaired P50 suppression covaried with
      clinical ratings of anxiety, depression, and anergia; results also suggested that
      the P50 inhibitory deficit may be related to the degree of patients' attentional 
      impairment. Finally, risperidone, compared with a typical antipsychotic
      medication, improved inhibition of P50 to the second click. These results support
      P50 suppression as a measure of disordered neurocognition in schizophrenia.

TI  - Oral olanzapine versus oral haloperidol in the maintenance treatment of
      schizophrenia and related psychoses.
PG  - 499-505
AB  - BACKGROUND: Three studies compared olanzapine and haloperidol given orally in
      maintenance therapy for schizophrenia and related psychoses. METHOD: Data were
      from double-blind extensions of acute studies. The subjects met criteria for
      schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Subjects
      had responded to acute therapy (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score
      decreased > or = 40% from baseline (Studies 1, 2, and 3) or was < or = 18
      (Studies 1 and 2)) and were out-patients at their last acute phase visit. Relapse
      was defined as hospitalisation for psychopathology. Subjects treated with
      olanzapine in the three studies were pooled to form the olanzapine group and
      subjects treated with haloperidol were pooled to form the haloperidol group.
      RESULTS: Olanzapine-treated subjects experienced less relapse (P = 0.034). The
      Kaplan-Meier estimated one-year risk of relapse was 19.7% with olanzapine and 28%
      with haloperidol. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine was superior to haloperidol in the
      maintenance therapy of schizophrenia and related psychoses. DECLARATION OF

PG  - 513-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years there has been a shift to 'community care' and the
      introduction of several 'atypical' antipsychotic drugs. We report the impact of
      these changes. METHOD: In Nithsdale, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, the
      population of patients with schizophrenia was identified in 1996. This census
      replicated a study carried out in 1981. The population with schizophrenia were
      compared on clinical and social variables. The whereabouts in 1996 of the 1981
      population was determined. RESULTS: In comparison with the 1981 population, more 
      patients in 1996 had positive, negative and non-schizophrenic symptoms. More
      showed tardive dyskinesia. Social adjustment had not changed. They had spent less
      time in hospital; fewer (13%) were living with their parents; and fewer (8%) were
      employed. By 1996, 35% of the 1981 cohort had died (standardised mortality rate
      male-154; female-162). CONCLUSIONS: The mental health of a community of people
      with schizophrenia living in a rural area in 1996 was poorer than in 1981.

TI  - Post-marketing studies: the work of the Drug Safety Research Unit.
PG  - 343-53
AB  - The Drug Safety Research Unit (DSRU) is the centre for prescription-event
      monitoring (PEM) in England. PEM studies are noninterventional observational
      cohort studies which monitor the safety of newly marketed drugs. The need for
      post-marketing surveillance is well recognised in the UK and general practice is 
      an ideal source of data. PEM studies are general practitioner (community)-based
      and exposure is based on dispensed prescription data in England. To date, 65 PEM 
      studies have been completed with a mean cohort size of 10 979 patients and the
      DSRU database has clinical information on over 700000 patients prescribed new
      drugs. Unlike spontaneous reporting schemes, PEM produces incidence rates for
      events reported during treatment. Comparative studies can be conducted for drugs 
      in the same class. The DSRU aggregates outcome data for pregnancies exposed to
      new drugs. Data for children and the elderly can also be specifically examined.
      PEM data have a number of advantages over data from computerised general practice
      databases in the UK. PEM is the only technique within the UK capable of
      monitoring newly marketed drugs in such a comprehensive and systematic way.

      between schizophrenics treated with typical antipsychotic drugs (APD) and those
      treated with clozapine. Clozapine treatment was associated with an attenuation of
      the capacity for fine motor control. We now report that a test-retest study with 
      41 treatment-refractory patients confirms our earlier finding; the FC deficit is 
      due primarily to clozapine treatment. An additional comparison was made with 10
      patients who were administered the FC test repeatedly through the initial
      clozapine titration interval of 6-8 weeks. The results suggest that two distinct 
      clozapine effects can be distinguished, an initial transient stage characterized 
      by 'drowsiness' and a subsequent stage with dose-dependent emerging myoclonic
      features.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of neuroleptics in behavioral disorders associated with
      dementia.
PG  - 550-61; quiz 562-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroleptics are commonly used to treat behavioral disorders
      associated with dementia. However, their safety and efficacy have not been well
      established in these patients. METHOD: A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled 
      (either placebo or active drug), double-blind trials published since 1966 (N =
      16; 499 treated, 112 active controls, and 123 placebo) was conducted. Data were
      collected on proportion of patients with clinically significant improvement,
      significant side effects, and dropout rates. RESULTS: Pooled mean percentages of 
      patients who improved (95% CI): all neuroleptics, 64% (54% to 74%); low potency, 
      63% (54% to 72%); moderate potency, 70% (56% to 85%); moderate-high potency, 62% 
      (49% to 75%); and high potency, 69% (49% to 90%). Thus, no differences in
      efficacy existed between different potencies of neuroleptics. Therapeutic effect 
      (neuroleptic minus placebo) was only 26% (14% to 38%). Treatment-emergent side
      effects were more common for neuroleptics vs. placebo (mean difference = 25%, 13%
      to 37%), but pooled mean dropout rates were not different (mean difference = 4%, 
      -7% to 14%). Neither weighting by clinical trial quality (3 raters; weighted
      agreement, 83% to 92%) nor exclusion of poor quality trials changed the results. 
      CONCLUSION: Neuroleptics have small but significant efficacy over placebo in this
      population, and the efficacy rate is equivalent to the side effect rate.
      Comparing different neuroleptics shows they have similar efficacy, side effects, 
      and dropout rates. Further study to determine more specific drug-responsive
      behaviors is needed to maximize benefits of these drugs.

TI  - Clinical and neurocognitive effects of clozapine and risperidone in
      treatment-refractory schizophrenic patients: a prospective study.
PG  - 521-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few controlled studies have compared the efficacy of clozapine and
      risperidone in treatment-refractory schizophrenic patients. The present study
      investigates the efficacy of both clozapine and risperidone on psychopathologic
      and neurocognitive measures in a prospective 12-week open-label trial in
      treatment-refractory schizophrenic patients from state psychiatric hospitals.
      METHOD: Thirty-five DSM-IV schizophrenic patients with a documented history of
      nonresponse to typical neuroleptics were treated with either clozapine or
      risperidone. Response was assessed every 2 weeks by independent raters with the
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions
      (CGI) scale, neurologic rating scales, and plasma drug levels. Neurocognitive
      tests were administered at baseline and week 12. RESULTS: Both clozapine and
      risperidone brought about significant (p < .003) overall improvement in
      psychopathology. However, clozapine was numerically superior to risperidone on
      PANSS total scores and PANSS positive, negative, excitement, and cognitive
      factors. Extrapyramidal side effects were minimal for clozapine, whereas some
      were present for risperidone. Patients taking risperidone improved significantly 
      in the beginning stages of the study and remained stable thereafter. Patients
      taking clozapine showed a gradual improvement that occurred over the entire
      length of the trial. Neurocognitive measures showed minimal improvement and did
      not differentiate between the 2 medication groups. CONCLUSION: Both clozapine and
      risperidone were comparably effective across a wide spectrum of psychopathologic 
      measures. While the efficacy of clozapine was only numerically superior to that
      of risperidone, it was associated with fewer extrapyramidal side effects and with
      progressive improvement over the 12-week treatment period, suggesting that in
      longer trials clozapine may prove to be superior to risperidone in
      neuroleptic-refractory patients.

TI  - Risperidone is associated with blunting of D-fenfluramine evoked serotonergic
      responses in schizophrenia.
PG  - 199-203
AB  - The high 5-HT affinity of some atypical antipsychotic agents is thought to
      contribute to their clinical efficacy. We examined central 5-HT responses in two 
      groups of ten schizophrenic patients by measuring serum prolactin and cortisol
      responses to the neuroendocrine challenge D-fenfluramine. One group of patients
      with schizophrenia was tested after a 2-week neuroleptic free period. A similar
      group were tested after a mean of 12 weeks treatment with the atypical
      antipsychotic risperidone. A significant elevation of baseline serum prolactin
      levels, consistent with dopaminergic antagonism was seen after risperidone
      treatment. Significantly reduced 5-HT mediated serum prolactin responses were
      seen in risperidone treated patients. D-fenfluramine evoked serum prolactin
      responses were positively correlated with positive but not negative schizophrenic
      symptoms for all 20 patients. Risperidone treatment was associated with a
      significant functional in-vivo 5-HT antagonism similar to clozapine. 5-HT
      antagonism may contribute to the efficacy of risperidone against positive
      schizophrenic symptoms.

TI  - Economic outcomes of antipsychotic agents in a Medicaid population: traditional
      agents vs. risperidone.
PG  - 373-82
AB  - Clinical trials reveal that the newer atypical antipsychotic agents are more
      effective and have fewer side effects than traditional agents. However, these
      newer agents have a higher acquisition cost than traditional agents. This study
      assessed the differential impact of risperidone and traditional agents on the
      total schizophrenia-related cost of care for Medicaid patients suffering from
      schizophrenia. This was a retrospective longitudinal pretest-posttest analysis of
      Medicaid claims data covering January 1992 to August 1996. Continuously eligible 
      patients (n = 150) with a documented diagnosis of schizophrenia were evaluated.
      Medical claims were analyzed for patients treated with traditional antipsychotics
      for at least 12 months and then switched to risperidone and followed for at least
      12 months. Patients who failed on at least one traditional agent and who remained
      on other traditional agents throughout the study timeframe served as a control
      group. Monthly costs per patient were estimated using mixed model linear
      regression with age and gender serving as covariates. The total monthly costs per
      patient for the risperidone and traditional cohorts were similar ($1,050.52 and
      $946.24, respectively; p = .5438) during the pretest phase of the study. For
      patients treated with risperidone, drug costs were $177.35 higher (CL0.95 +/-
      $7.64; p = .0001) per patient per month in the posttest period compared with the 
      pretest period. However inpatient hospital costs were $312.04 lower (CL0.95 +/-
      $146.76; p = .001) per patient per month in the posttest period compared with the
      pretest period. In addition, physician costs were $9.55 lower (CL0.95 +/- $5.31; 
      p = .0004) per patient per month in the posttest period. The difference from the 
      pretest to posttest period for outpatient mental health clinic costs was
      statistically similar. For those in the risperidone cohort, total estimated costs
      decreased by $204.87 per patient per month during treatment with risperidone
      (CL0.95 +/- $161.01; p = .0127). Over the same time-frame, total costs increased 
      $160.68 per patient per month (CL0.95 +/- $196.04; n.s.; p = .1082) in the
      control cohort. While the mean monthly drug cost was significantly higher during 
      treatment with risperidone, this increase was offset by cost reductions elsewhere
      in the system.

      learning in treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients.
PG  - 726-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study compared the effects of risperidone vs. haloperidol
      on reaction time, manual dexterity, and two types of motor learning in a sample
      of treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients. METHODS: Fifty-six DSM-III-R
      diagnosed schizophrenia inpatients participated in a randomized, double-blind
      comparison of risperidone vs. haloperidol. Measures of reaction time, manual
      dexterity, motor sequence learning, and gross motor learning were administered at
      baseline, after 4 weeks of fixed-dose medication, and after 4 weeks of
      flexible-dose medication. RESULTS: The results indicated that patients receiving 
      risperidone showed greater improvement in reaction time and manual dexterity than
      patients receiving haloperidol. After covarying symptom changes and movement
      disorder ratings, the results remained significant. The two treatment groups did 
      not differ on either measure of motor learning. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in
      performance in reaction time and manual dexterity may be due to a specific
      beneficial effect of risperidone, as opposed to a general reduction in
      extrapyramidal symptom liability, compared to haloperidol.

TI  - Relationship between patient variables and plasma clozapine concentrations: a
      dosing nomogram.
PG  - 733-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous work has suggested factors such as gender, smoking behavior,
      dose, and age affect the amount of drug a patient requires to achieve a desired
      plasma concentration of clozapine. Plasma clozapine concentrations ranging from
      350 to 504 ng/mL in treatment-refractory schizophrenics and schizoaffective
      patients produce response rates ranging approximately 55-80%. Without the aid of 
      clozapine plasma concentration monitoring, 3-6 months are recommended for a
      therapeutic clozapine trial. Data suggest that the lag time to response can be
      reduced by administering a dose that produces a therapeutic clozapine
      concentration. METHODS: To generate a clozapine dosing nomogram to predict
      clozapine steady-state plasma concentrations, a cohort of 71 patients was
      collected via retrospective chart review and/or patient interview. Clozapine
      steady-state plasma concentrations and demographic variables were obtained.
      Multiple-linear regression was utilized to examine the relationship between the
      plasma clozapine concentration and the independent variables. RESULTS: The dosing
      model that optimally predicted steady-state clozapine plasma concentrations
      included the variables dose (mg/day), smoking (yes = 0 and no = 1), gender, and a
      dose-gender interaction variable. The model explained 47% of the variance in the 
      clozapine concentrations (F = 14.42, p < .001, r2 = .47). Two equations, one for 
      male subjects, i.e., clozapine (ng/mL) = 111 (smoke) + 0.464 (dose) + 145, and
      one for female subjects, i.e., clozapine (ng/mL) = 111 (smoke) + 1.590
      (dose)-149, were derived to predict clozapine steady-state plasma concentrations 
      to serve as a clozapine dosing guide for clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: A clozapine
      dosing nomogram was constructed as a clinical aid to facilitate clozapine dosing.

      intrinsic component of the disorder. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that 
      is superior to typical agents in the treatment of positive symptoms. The degree
      to which clozapine ameliorates cognitive deficits, however, is still
      controversial. Mismatch negativity (MMN), N200 (N2), and P300 (P3) are cognitive 
      event-related potentials (ERPs) that index preattentive (MMN) and
      attention-dependent information processing (N2, P3) and provide a measure of
      cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. In schizophrenic patients
      deficient generation of MMN, N2, and P3 has been observed, suggesting impairments
      of discrete stages of information processing. METHODS: This study investigates
      the effects of clozapine treatment on MMN, N2, and P3 generation. Patients were
      recruited from a haloperidol-controlled, double-blind treatment study of
      clozapine in chronic schizophrenia. ERPs were obtained at the beginning of the
      study and after 9 weeks (4 patients) and 16 weeks (13 patients) of treatment.
      RESULTS: Clozapine treatment was associated with a significant increase of P3
      amplitude, which was not observed in the haloperidol group; however, clozapine
      treatment did not affect deficits in MMN and N2. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
      suggest that clozapine--in contrast to conventional antipsychotics--improves
      electrophysiological measures of attention-dependent information processing, but 
      does not ameliorate preattentive deficits.

PG  - 151-5
AB  - This study examined changes in attentional performance in patients with
      schizophrenia during the 2 months after initiating treatment with quetiapine
      fumarate. Prior to treatment, attentional performance in patients with
      schizophrenia (n = 10) was significantly (p < 0.01) worse than in matched
      controls (n = 12). During treatment with quetiapine, performance in patients with
      schizophrenia improved, and by 2 months, did not differ significantly from that
      of the controls. These results suggest that quetiapine produces a significant
      improvement in attentional functioning in patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Olanzapine response in treatment-refractory schizophrenic patients with a history
      of substance abuse.
PG  - 95-101
AB  - As many as half of all schizophrenic patients have abused alcohol or illicit
      drugs. This study determines the extent of substance abuse in a
      treatment-resistant population and assesses the response of this population to
      olanzapine treatment. Sixty patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia 
      were included in an open 7-week trial of up to 25 mg/day of olanzapine. A history
      of substance abuse was present in 23 (38%) of the patients. At baseline
      evaluation, patients with a history of substance abuse had lower CGI scores and
      less negative symptomatology while having a higher rate of tardive dyskinesia.
      The overall group improved significantly over time. There were no differences in 
      response between the substance-abusing (SA) and non-substance-abusing (NSA)
      patients as measured by the total BPRS, GGI and SANS ratings. The NSA group had
      significantly greater improvement in negative symptoms as measured by the BPRS
      negative symptom factor. Sixty-nine per cent (16/23) of the SA group and 60%
      (22/37) of the NSA were considered olanzapine responders by a priori criteria (p 
      = NS). Extrapyramidal symptoms declined significantly in the overall group, but
      did not significantly differ between the SA and NSA groups. Treatment-refractory 
      patients with prior substance abuse had a comparable outcome on olanzapine
      therapy to those with no history of abuse, as well as no increase in adverse
      effects. This suggests that olanzapine may be of benefit to SA patients who have 
      a greater tendency for antipsychotic side effects and tardive dyskinesia.

AB  - In clinical practice, patients are encountered who are partial responders or
      nonresponders to clozapine. There are others who are unable to tolerate a high
      dosage of clozapine. In the two cases presented, we propose an alternative
      strategy using olanzapine in combination with clozapine in treatment-refractory
      patients. Olanzapine was found to be helpful in these patients, however,
      controlled studies are needed.

TI  - Predictors of differential response to clozapine and haloperidol. Veterans
      Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia.
PG  - 475-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to identify baseline predictors of response to clozapine.
      METHODS: Data were from a 15-site randomized clinical trial comparing clozapine
      and haloperidol in hospitalized patients with refractory schizophrenia (n = 423).
      Three-month outcomes were analyzed with the full sample (n = 368 due to
      attrition). Because of crossovers, analyses of 12-month outcomes were conducted
      with crossovers excluded (n = 291). Clinical predictors included age, race,
      diagnosis (current substance abuse, paranoid subtype of schizophrenia, or
      depressive syndrome), severity of symptoms, quality of life, age at onset of
      schizophrenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and VA compensation payment. Multiple
      regression analysis was used to examine the interaction of treatment condition
      and each of these variables in predicting outcomes for symptoms, quality of life,
      side effects, and days hospitalized. RESULTS: Patients with higher quality of
      life at baseline (p = .04) and higher symptoms (p = .02) had relatively smaller
      declines in hospital days at 6 months. In the 12-month sample patients with
      higher levels of symptoms had greater symptom reductions at 12 months (p = .03)
      and greater improvement in quality of life (p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Although high
      levels of symptoms were associated with greater improvement on clozapine, these
      findings are not robust enough to suggest that any specific, clinically defined
      subgroup of refractory patients should be preferentially targeted for clozapine
      treatment.

TI  - Constipation as an adverse effect of drug use in nursing home patients: an
      overestimated risk.
PG  - 255-61
AB  - AIMS: To investigate whether results from case control and cross sectional
      studies which suggest an association between laxative use and other drug use
      could be confirmed in a cohort study of nursing home patients. METHODS: A
      prospective cohort study of 2355 nursing home patients aged 65 years and over was
      performed to estimate the incidence relative risk of constipation associated with
      drug use. The study was conducted with prescription sequence analysis of each
      resident's detailed pharmacy records and data on morbidity and mobility. RESULTS:
      Use of drugs, which according to the summaries of product characteristics (SPC)
      and the literature on adverse drug effects have moderately to strongly
      constipating properties, was associated with a relative risk of 1.59 (95% CI
      1.24-2.04) for the occurrence of constipation during exposure time. Use of drugs 
      with mildly to moderately constipating effects was not associated with laxative
      use (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.93-1.38). Stratification on the level of age, gender, type
      of nursing (psychogeriatric or somatic), morbidity, number of medications taken
      and mobility showed no confounding effects of these variables on outcome
      measurements. These variables all acted as effect modifiers. Effect of age and
      number of medications taken on the relative risk was nonlinear. CONCLUSIONS:
      Although an association between drugs that exhibit moderately to strongly
      constipating effects and occurrence of constipation was found, the risk was not
      as high as seen in previous studies. The high prevalence of constipation in
      nursing home patients is only partly due to adverse drug effects.

TI  - Typical and atypical antipsychotics in adolescent schizophrenia: efficacy,
      tolerability, and differential sensitivity to extrapyramidal symptoms.
PG  - 596-604
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the existing literature on the efficacy and tolerability of 
      antipsychotics for adolescent psychosis. The review focuses in particular on
      literature regarding adverse effects that are thought to have an increased
      incidence in young patients and on the possible neurobiological bases for such
      differential sensitivity. METHOD: Pertinent studies were sought using Medline
      searches, supplemented by selected bibliographies, and reviewed. RESULTS: There
      is a relative paucity of research in this area; in particular, well-controlled
      trails are lacking. The existing literature suggests fairly good efficacy of both
      typical and atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of psychotic disorders in
      children and adolescents. However, the incidence of certain side effects,
      particularly extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). is found to be higher in younger
      patients compared with adults. Positron emission tomography (PET) receptor
      studies in adults have demonstrated that the incidence of EPS is related to
      dose-dependent dopamine type-2 (D2) receptor occupancy and that there is a
      significant relationship between the number of these receptors and age.
      CONCLUSIONS: Improved tolerability is leading to the increasing us of atypical
      antipsychotics for adolescent patients, though these new drugs to have specific
      adverse effects of their own. There is a need for more controlled studies of
      atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents. In particular, dose-finding 
      studies are needed to determine the optimal dose range to produce the greatest
      improvement with the least side effects for each of these drugs.

      administered a single dose of clozapine or CNO in a randomized crossover manner. 
      2. Using a general pharmacokinetic model for the interconversion process, the
      mean total clearances of clozapine and CNO were 28.45 L/hr and 45.30 L/hr,
      respectively. These values were similar to the values obtained by the usual
      model-independent method of pharmacokinetic analysis. 3. When administered
      clozapine, mean CNO plasma concentrations of 17.7 +/- 16.4 ng/ml were slightly
      lower than the other clozapine metabolite-desmethylclozapine (DCLOZ) plasma
      levels of 24.4 +/- 8.6 ng/ml at the 12 hour time point. When CNO was
      administered, plasma concentrations at the 12 hour time point of clozapine were
      twice the amount of CNO (28.1 +/- 8.9 ng/ml vs 14.4 +/- 8.8 ng/ml). 4. DCLOZ
      plasma concentrations were detected in all patients upon clozapine
      administration. Upon CNO administration, only one patient had detectable plasma
      DCLOZ levels. 5. The interconversion process of clozapine and CNO could partially
      account for the wide interpatient variability reported for clozapine plasma
      concentrations in schizophrenic patients.

TI  - Rodent data and general hypothesis: antipsychotic action exerted through 5-Ht2A
      receptor antagonism is dependent on increased serotonergic tone.
PG  - 365-96
AB  - The locomotor stimulation induced by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
      antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine) in mice was regarded as a model of at least some 
      aspects of schizophrenia. The serotonin synthesis inhibitor
      dl-p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) was used to evaluate the involvement of
      endogenous serotonin in (a) the induction of MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion in
      NMRI mice, and (b) the inhibition of MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion by each of
      five monoaminergic antagonists (M100907, clozapine, olanzapine, raclopride,
      SCH23390). Further, brain monoaminergic biochemistry was characterised in rats
      and mice after various drug treatments. PCPA pretreatment did not significantly
      reduce MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion in any of the experiments performed;
      however in a meta-analysis of six experiments, the locomotion displayed by
      MK-801-treated animals was diminished 17% by PCPA pretreatment. The selective
      5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of
      MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion. This effect was abolished in mice pretreated with
      PCPA, but could be restored in a dose-dependent manner by restitution of
      endogenous 5-HT by means of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). On the other hand, the
      inhibition of MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion exerted by the selective dopamine
      D-2 receptor antagonist raclopride or the dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist
      SCH23390 was unaffected by PCPA pretreatment. The antipsychotics clozapine and
      olanzapine displayed a split profile. Hence, the inhibitory effect on
      MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion exerted by low doses of these compounds was
      diminished after PCPA pretreatment, while inhibition exerted by higher doses was 
      unaffected by PCPA. These results suggest that (1) MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion
      is accompanied by an activation of, but is not fully dependent upon, brain
      serotonergic systems. (2) In the hypoglutamatergic state induced by MK-801,
      endogenous serotonin exerts a stimulatory effect on locomotion through an action 
      at 5-HT2A receptors, an effect that is almost completely counterbalanced by a
      concomitant inhibitory impact on locomotion, mediated through stimulation of
      serotonin receptors other than 5-HT2A receptors. M100907, by blocking 5-HT2A
      receptors, unveils the inhibitory effect exerted on locomotion by these other
      serotonin receptors. (3) Dopamine D-2 receptor antagonistic properties of
      antipsychotic compounds, when they come into play, override 5-HT2A receptor
      antagonism. Possible implications for the treatment of schizophrenia with 5-HT2A 
      receptor antagonists are discussed. It is hypothesized that treatment response to
      such agents is dependent on increased serotonergic tone.

      rendered to 18- to 50-year-old Medicaid recipients in the State of Georgia over a
      3-year period. A cohort of 6,443 schizophrenia patients were identified by
      inspecting the medical history data for claims indicative of schizophrenia
      (ICD-9-CM 295.xx). A crude prevalence of 6.02 percent was identified. Use
      patterns and charges associated with schizophrenia were stratified by major areas
      of service including ambulatory services, hospitalizations, and pharmacological
      treatment. The incidence of rehospitalization for chronic schizophrenia patients 
      based on a 12-month hospitalization index format was also identified. Findings
      are discussed regarding using these data to focus strategies for assessing
      schizophrenia treatment outcome in relation to treatment cost.

TI  - Meta-analysis of studies on genetic variation in 5-HT2A receptors and clozapine
      response.
PG  - 93-9
AB  - Serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter receptors are targeted by atypical
      antipsychotic drugs. We hypothesized that genetic variation in these receptors
      may affect clinical response to the drugs targeting them. This hypothesis has
      been tested by several studies in which the correlation between polymorphic
      variants in the 5-HT2A receptor gene and clinical response to the atypical
      antipsychotic clozapine was investigated. The results of these studies either
      found association between 5-HT2A genetic variants and clozapine response or found
      differences in the same direction which did not reach statistical significance.
      Meta-analysis of these studies including 373 patients who responded to the
      treatment and 360 non-responders showed association between two 5-HT2A
      polymorphisms, 102-T/C and His452Tyr, and clozapine response. Statistical
      analysis of extreme responders showed a clearer association of the 102-T/C with
      clozapine response. These results reinforce the hypothesis and strengthen the
      candidacy of these receptors as important therapeutic targets.

      patients and normal control subjects.
PG  - 255-65
AB  - In an exploratory study, 10 schizophrenic patients and 10 normal control subjects
      performed immediate and delayed memory tasks, which were variants of previously
      developed continuous performance tests. Both tasks required participants to
      identify five-digit numbers which were repeated. Numbers were presented in series
      for 500 ms each and separated by a 500-ms time-out period. In the immediate
      memory task, subjects were to respond if a number was identical to the one that
      had immediately preceded it. The delayed memory task differed from the first task
      in that a longer delay (3.5 s) between stimuli was introduced, and during this
      delay distracter stimuli appeared. While normal control subjects performed
      accurately on both tasks (exceeding 80% correct detections), schizophrenic
      patients performed poorly, performing worse on the delayed memory task than on
      the immediate memory task. Rates of commission errors (responses made to similar,
      but not identical numbers) were nearly equal between groups on the immediate
      memory task, but on the delayed memory task normal control subjects made
      relatively more commission errors while schizophrenic patients made fewer
      commission errors. No differences in response latencies were observed between
      subject groups or tasks. This paradigm may prove useful in discriminating subtle 
      differences in immediate and delayed memory capability among psychiatric
      populations and normal control subjects.

TI  - Amisulpride, and atypical antipsychotic, in the treatment of acute episodes of
      schizophrenia: a dose-ranging study vs. haloperidol. The Amisulpride Study Group.
PG  - 65-72
AB  - This 4-week, double-blind, randomized study was undertaken to determine the
      dose-response relationship of amisulpride in 319 patients with acute exacerbation
      of schizophrenia. Fixed doses of amisulpride (400, 800 and 1200 mg/day) and
      haloperidol (16 mg/day) were compared to amisulpride, 100 mg/day, as a
      potentially subtherapeutic dose. Efficacy data (BPRS total score and PANSS
      positive subscale) in the amisulpride groups generated a bell-shaped
      dose-response curve, with 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day being the most effective
      treatments for positive symptoms. Parkinsonism did not increase significantly
      between baseline and endpoint with amisulpride 400, 800 and 1200 mg/day compared 
      to the amisulpride 100 mg/day group, whereas the difference was significant for
      haloperidol (P<0.05). It is concluded that amisulpride 400 mg and 800 mg/day is
      highly effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, with less
      extrapyramidal side-effects than haloperidol 16 mg/day.

TI  - Early developmental differences between DSM-III-R schizophrenics treated with
      clozapine and typical neuroleptics.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - Developmental deviance is known to be associated with schizophrenia. We tested
      the hypothesis that the most severe schizophrenia requiring treatment with
      clozapine would particularly show these effects. Therefore, associative factors
      from pregnancy, delivery, neonatal and socio-demographic characteristics were
      compared between the clozapine-treated schizophrenic cases (n = 17) and the
      remaining cases of schizophrenia treated with typical neuroleptics (n = 59) from 
      an unselected, general population North Finland 1966 Birth Cohort, (n = 11,017). 
      By the end of 1994, seventeen (22%) of a total 76 DSM-III-R schizophrenia
      patients, had received clozapine treatment. The mean length at birth was 52 cm in
      the clozapine group (in the non-clozapine group 50 cm) and correspondingly the
      mean one year weight 10.4 kg (9.8 kg), with the differences between the groups
      being statistically significant (P < 0.05). Other pregnancy, delivery, and
      socio-demographic characteristics were, however, similar in the clozapine-treated
      and the remaining cases with schizophrenia. There was no evidence that severe
      schizophrenia requiring treatment with clozapine was associated with impaired
      intrauterine or post-natal development. Indeed, during the first years of life
      the former group was larger in terms of weight and length than those treated with
      typical neuroleptics. These early developmental characteristics did not predict
      clinical severity of schizophrenia in adulthood.

AB  - Treating schizophrenia is expensive. Preventing rehospitalization of patients
      with schizophrenia provides an attractive opportunity for cost savings,
      especially for patients with 'revolving-door' or multiple-episode schizophrenia. 
      Reducing the occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse events
      associated with standard antipsychotic agents may increase compliance and reduce 
      the rate of rehospitalization of patients with schizophrenia. Quetiapine
      ('Seroquel', ICI 204,636, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals) is a new dibenzothiazepine
      antipsychotic agent with a low propensity for extrapyramidal symptoms. We
      describe here a unique methodology to compare quetiapine with usual-care
      medications in real-world treatment settings. The trial objective is to determine
      if therapy with this new atypical antipsychotic agent can reduce the rate of
      rehospitalization and, therefore, treatment costs. Using two secondary
      medical-claims databases, we defined the minimal threshold for revolving-door
      status as 1.0 admission per year; this definition allows our trial to focus on
      the subpopulation of schizophrenic patients with the greatest potential for cost 
      savings by either the new atypical antipsychotic quetiapine or usual-care
      therapy. We describe here the approach used in our trial.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol for perception of emotion in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia: preliminary findings.
PG  - 159-65
AB  - Currently, little is known about the pharmacological effects of the new
      generation of antipsychotic medications on perception of emotion in
      schizophrenia. The present study was designed to compare the effects of
      risperidone versus haloperidol on the ability to perceive emotion in 20
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients, using a double-blind design. Measures
      of emotion perception included a facial emotion identification test (still
      photographs presented on videotape), a voice emotion identification test
      (audiotape), and an affect perception test (brief interpersonal vignettes
      presented on videotape). These measures were administered during the final week
      of baseline and after 8 weeks of double-blind medication. Risperidone treatment
      produced a greater effect on patients' ability to perceive emotion compared with 
      haloperidol treatment. Additionally, all patients who received risperidone
      demonstrated improvement in performance between baseline and retest, compared
      with four of the nine patients who received haloperidol. When changes in positive
      symptoms were statistically controlled, the results remained significant. These
      findings suggest that resperidone may facilitate patients' ability to accurately 
      perceive emotion, an effect which may be mediated either directly by
      risperidone's pharmacological action or perhaps indirectly by its influence on
      basic neurocognition.

TI  - An exploratory haloperidol-controlled dose-finding study of ziprasidone in
      hospitalized patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 296-304
AB  - Ninety patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to
      DSM-III-R criteria participated in this double-blind, exploratory, dose-ranging
      trial. After a single-blind washout period of 4 to 7 days, patients were randomly
      assigned to receive one of four fixed doses of the new antipsychotic, ziprasidone
      4 (N = 19), 10 (N = 17), 40 (N = 17), or 160 (N = 20) mg/day or haloperidol 15
      mg/day (N = 17) for 4 weeks. A dose-response relationship among ziprasidone
      groups was established for improvements in Clinical Global Impression Severity
      (CGI-S) score (p = 0.002) but not in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total 
      score (p = 0.08). The intent-to-treat analysis of mean changes from baseline in
      the BPRS total, BPRS Psychosis core, and CGI-S scores demonstrated that
      ziprasidone 160 mg/day was comparable with haloperidol in reducing overall
      psychopathology and positive symptoms and was superior to ziprasidone 4 mg/day.
      Despite the small sample size and short duration of the trial, the improvement in
      CGI-S with both ziprasidone 160 mg/day and haloperidol 15 mg/day was
      statistically significantly greater than with ziprasidone 4 mg/day (p = 0.001
      andp = 0.005, respectively). The percentage of patients classified as responders 
      on both the BPRS total (> or = 30% improvement) and CGI-Improvement (score of 1
      or 2) scales in the ziprasidone 160 mg/day group was similar to that in the
      haloperidol group and nonsignificantly greater than that in the ziprasidone 4
      mg/day group. On all assessments of clinical efficacy, the improvements
      associated with ziprasidone 4 mg/day, 10 mg/day, and 40 mg/day were similar.
      Concomitant benztropine use at any time during the study was less frequent with
      ziprasidone 160 mg/day (15%) than with haloperidol (53%). Haloperidol was
      associated with a sustained hyperprolactinemia, unlike ziprasidone, where only
      transient elevations in prolactin that returned to normal within the dosing
      interval were observed. Ziprasidone was well tolerated, and the incidence of
      adverse events was similar in all groups. The results of this study suggest that 
      ziprasidone 160 mg/day is as effective as haloperidol 15 mg/day in reducing
      overall psychopathology and positive symptoms of an acute exacerbation of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder but has a lower potential to induce
      extrapyramidal symptoms.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone in adults with autistic
      disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders.
PG  - 633-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin
      systems in the pathogenesis of autism. Open-label reports suggest that the
      serotonin2A-dopamine D2 antagonist risperidone may be safe and effective in
      reducing the interfering symptoms of patients with autism. METHODS: Thirty-one
      adults (age [mean+/-SD], 28.1+/-7.3 years) with autistic disorder (n=17) or
      pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (n=14) participated in a
      12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of risperidone. Patients treated
      with placebo subsequently received a 12-week open-label trial of risperidone.
      RESULTS: For persons completing the study, 8 (57%) of 14 patients treated with
      risperidone were categorized as responders (daily dose [mean+/-SD], 2.9+/-1.4 mg)
      compared with none of 16 in the placebo group (P<.002). Risperidone was superior 
      to placebo in reducing repetitive behavior (P<.001), aggression (P<.001), anxiety
      or nervousness (P<.02), depression (P<.03), irritability (P<.01), and the overall
      behavioral symptoms of autism (P<.02). Objective, measurable change in social
      behavior and language did not occur. Nine (60%) of 15 patients who received
      treatment with open-label risperidone following the double-blind placebo phase
      responded. Other than mild, transient sedation, risperidone was well tolerated,
      with no evidence of extrapyramidal effects, cardiac events, or seizures.
      CONCLUSION: Risperidone is more effective than placebo in the short-term
      treatment of symptoms of autism in adults.

TI  - Does participation in psychosocial treatment augment the benefit of clozapine?
      Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Clozapine in Refractory
      Schizophrenia.
PG  - 618-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examines the role of participation in psychosocial
      treatment as a mediator of the clinical effectiveness of clozapine. METHODS:
      Subjects participated in a 12-month double-blind random-assignment trial
      comparing clozapine and haloperidol in patients hospitalized 30 to 364 days for
      refractory schizophrenia at 15 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. A 
      broker-advocate case management intervention was used to facilitate participation
      in psychosocial treatments and to document such participation. RESULTS: Between
      those who continued receiving clozapine (n=122) or a conventional antipsychotic
      drug (n=169) for 12 months, those receiving clozapine were more likely to
      participate in psychosocial rehabilitation treatment. Although they were no more 
      likely to receive clinical recommendations for such treatments, they were more
      likely to both verbally accept recommendations and to act on them. Structural
      equation modeling shows that participation in psychosocial treatment did not play
      a mediating role in clozapine's effect on outcomes at 6 months, but was
      associated with both reduced symptoms and improved quality of life at 12 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine facilitates participation in psychosocial treatment, and
      such enhanced participation is associated with improved quality-of-life and
      symptom outcomes. Psychosocial rehabilitation should be offered concomitantly
      with clozapine.

TI  - 5-HT2 and D2 receptor occupancy of olanzapine in schizophrenia: a PET
      investigation.
PG  - 921-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Olanzapine is a new atypical antipsychotic recently introduced for the
      treatment of schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to investigate
      olanzapine's binding to the serotonin 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptors in
      schizophrenic patients being treated with clinically relevant doses. METHOD:
      Twelve patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 5, 10, 15, or 20
      mg/day of olanzapine in a prospective fashion. Three other subjects taking 30-40 
      mg/day were also included. Once steady-state plasma levels were achieved,
      dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors were assessed by using [11C]raclopride 
      and [18F]setoperone positron emission tomography imaging, respectively. Ratings
      of clinical status, extrapyramidal side effects, and prolactin levels were also
      obtained. RESULTS: Olanzapine induced near saturation of the 5-HT2 receptors,
      even at 5 mg/day. Its D2 occupancy increased with dose: patients taking 5-20
      mg/day showed 43%-80% D2 occupancy, while patients taking 30-40 mg/day showed
      83%-88%. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine is a potent 5-HT2 blocker and shows a higher
      5-HT2 than D2 occupancy at all doses. However, its D2 occupancy is higher than
      that of clozapine and similar to that of risperidone. In the usual clinical dose 
      range of 10-20 mg/day, its occupancy varies from 71% to 80%, and this restricted 
      range may explain its freedom from extrapyramidal side effects and prolactin
      elevation. However, doses of 30 mg/day and higher are associated with more than
      80% D2 occupancy and may have a higher likelihood of prolactin elevation and
      extrapyramidal side effects.

TI  - Olanzapine compared with chlorpromazine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
PG  - 914-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of olanzapine
      with that of chlorpromazine plus benztropine in patients with treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. METHOD: One hundred three previously treatment-resistant patients 
      with schizophrenia diagnosed according to the DSM-III-R criteria were given a
      prospective 6-week trial of 10-40 mg/day of haloperidol. Eighty-four of them
      failed to respond to that trial and agreed to be randomly assigned to an 8-week
      fixed-dose trial of either 25 mg/day of olanzapine alone or 1200 mg/day of
      chlorpromazine plus 4 mg/day of benztropine mesylate. RESULTS: Fifty-nine (70%)
      of the 84 subjects completed the trial. The primary outcome measures were Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale total score and positive symptom score, Scale for the
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms global score, and Clinical Global Impression
      score. An analysis of variance for the subjects who completed the study showed no
      difference in efficacy between the two drugs. Seven percent of the
      olanzapine-treated patients responded according to a priori criteria; no
      chlorpromazine-treated patients responded. The olanzapine-treated patients had
      fewer motor and cardiovascular side effects than the chlorpromazine-treated
      patients. Extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia were similar in the two groups,
      although no antiparkinsonian drugs were used in the olanzapine group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine and chlorpromazine showed similar efficacy, and the total
      amount of improvement with either drug was modest. Olanzapine-treated patients
      had fewer side effects than chlorpromazine-treated patients.

TI  - Psychomotor slowing, negative symptoms and dopamine receptor availability--an
      IBZM SPECT study in neuroleptic-treated and drug-free schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - Anhedonia and psychomotor slowing in schizophrenia have been attributed to a
      dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission. To differentiate between disease
      and drug-induced negative symptoms, we examined eight drug-free and eight
      neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic patients. Positive and negative symptoms and
      extrapyramidal side effects were assessed using standardized rating scales (PSAS,
      AMDP, SANS). 'Reaction time' and 'motor speed' were measured using a
      computer-aided system and striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was
      assessed using [I-123]IBZM SPECT. Psychomotor reaction time, parkinsonism,
      affective flattening and avolition were increased in treated patients relative to
      the untreated cohort and were negatively correlated with dopamine D2/D3 receptor 
      availability. Significant positive correlations were found between parkinsonism
      and affective flattening and between psychomotor slowing and avolition. Positive 
      symptoms were not significantly associated with striatal IBZM binding. These
      findings support the hypothesis that neuroleptic-induced dopamine D2/D3 blockade 
      in the striatum can mimic certain negative symptoms, such as affective flattening
      and avolition, and indicates that psychomotor testing may be helpful in
      differentiating between disease and drug-induced negative symptoms.

TI  - Serotonin subtype 2 receptor genes and clinical response to clozapine in
      schizophrenia patients.
PG  - 123-32
AB  - Using a pharmacogenetic approach in 185 schizophrenics who have been
      prospectively assessed for clozapine response, we have examined the hypothesis
      that polymorphisms in the 5-HT2A (HTR2A), and 5-HT2C (HTR2C) genes are involved
      in its variable response. A-1438 A-->G polymorphism in the putative promoter and 
      a silent T-->C 102 substitution in HTR2A were in almost complete linkage
      disequilibrium, and neither was associated with response (T-->C. 102 allele: chi 
      2 = 0.02; 1 df, p = .90; genotype: chi 2 = 0.02, 2 df, p = .99). A his452tyr
      HTR2A polymorphism was found to be associated with clozapine response (his452tyr 
      allele: chi 2 = 6.43, 1 df, p = .01 [p = .04, Bonferroni corrected]; genotype:
      chi 2 = 6.54, 2 df, p = .04 [p = .16, Bonferroni corrected]). No HTR2A haplotype 
      was associated with response. Interethnic differences were observed in the
      frequencies of the cys23ser HTR2C polymorphism. This polymorphism was not
      significantly associated with response in either of the ethnic groups (Caucasian 
      and African American genotype: chi 2 = 3.46, 2 df, p = .18; chi 2 = .31, 2 df, p 
      = .86, respectively). Although replication is required, the overall results
      suggest that the his452tyr HTR2A polymorphism may be involved in clozapine
      response.

TI  - Effects of clozapine on in vitro immune parameters: a longitudinal study in
      clozapine-treated schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 114-22
AB  - Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent with immunomodulatory properties. We
      hypothesized that in vitro immune parameters of peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC) are affected in the course of clozapine treatment and that clozapine
      per se, added in vitro to PBMC cultures of clozapine-treated patients, exerts
      differential effects in the timecourse of treatment in vivo. We measured
      proliferation and cytokine secretion of PBMC, serum autoantibodies, and
      immunoglobulin levels in 17 patients before and during the first 6 weeks of
      clozapine treatment. Independent of clozapine dosage and rectal temperature,
      clozapine treatment in vivo suppressed proliferation and shedding of sIL-2r by
      PBMC, and the addition of clozapine in vitro induced, relative to unstimulated
      conditions, PBMC proliferation and secretion of IL-6 and sIL-2r. Serum IgG levels
      were increased; whereas, autoantibody pattern was unaffected. Thus, clozapine
      treatment and the addition of clozapine in vitro exert differential effects on
      various in vitro immune parameters independent of clozapine dosage and rectal
      temperature in the course of treatment.

TI  - Serum concentrations of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine are unaffected by the 
      potent CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole.
PG  - 167-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied a possible pharmacokinetic interaction between clozapine
      and itraconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. METHODS: A double-blind randomized
      study design was used. Seven schizophrenic inpatients volunteered to receive, in 
      addition to their previous drug regimen, either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo
      for 7 days. For the next 7 days, itraconazole was changed to placebo and vice
      versa. Serum concentrations of clozapine and its main metabolite
      desmethylclozapine were measured on days 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14. RESULTS: Concomitant
      administration of itraconazole had no significant effect on serum concentrations 
      of clozapine or desmethylclozapine. CONCLUSION: CYP3A4 seems to be of minor
      importance in clozapine metabolism in humans. Itraconazole, and probably also
      other inhibitors of CYP3A4, can be used concomitantly with clozapine.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of risperidone in chronic schizophrenic Thai patients.
PG  - 324-8
AB  - Risperidone is a novel serotonin-dopamine antagonist antipsychotic in a class of 
      benzisoxazole derivative which has been shown to be effective in reducing
      psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. The study was designed as perspective,
      8-week, multicenter, open label study in schizophrenic patients from 6
      psychiatric hospitals. One hundred and twenty cases were recruited and 105
      patients completed the study. The average total PANSS score at the baseline was
      90.6 (range 60-133). Patients were evaluated with quantitative rating scales for 
      the efficacy (PANSS score) and extrapyramidal rating scale at week 4 and 8 after 
      starting risperidone treatment. The titrated dose of risperidone was given to the
      patients with the final dose of 6 mg risperidone throughout the study period. At 
      week 4, the average PANSS score was significantly reduced to 73.4 (p < 0.05). The
      average PANSS score at week 8 was further declined to 61.9 which was
      significantly different (P < 0.05) from the baseline. Seventy-eight cases (74.3%)
      were classified as responders (those patients showing more than 20 per cent
      decrease in PANSS score). Extrapyramidal side effect was occurred in some
      patients, but usually mild and tolerable. However twenty-four patients (22.9%)
      required medications for this side effect. Other adverse reactions were insomnia 
      found 15 cases (14.3%), elevated hepatic enzyme 5 cases (4.8%) and weight gained 
      2 cases (1.9%). Our data suggested that risperidone is effective and
      well-tolerated in chronic schizophrenic Thai patients.

TI  - Risperidone compared with both lithium and haloperidol in mania: a double-blind
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 176-80
AB  - Case reports and studies of other neuroleptics suggest the efficacy of
      risperidone in the treatment of mania. Forty-five inpatients with DSM-IV mania
      were studied in a 28-day randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of either 6
      mg daily of risperidone, 10 mg daily of haloperidol, or 800 to 1200 mg daily of
      lithium. The patients in all three groups showed a similar improvement on the
      total score for all rating scales at day 28 (Brief Psychiatric rating scale;
      lithium 9.1, haloperidol 4.9, risperidone 6.5, F = 1.01, df = 2, p = 0.37; Mania 
      rating scale; lithium 15.7, haloperidol 10.2, risperidone 12.4, F = 1.07, df = 2,
      p = 0.35 [analysis of variance]). The Global Assessment of Functioning and
      Clinical Global Impression data showed a similar pattern of improvement. This
      study suggests that risperidone is of equivalent efficacy to lithium and
      haloperidol in the management of acute mania. The extrapyramidal side effects of 
      risperidone and haloperidol were not significantly different.

TI  - A double-blind, controlled comparison of the novel antipsychotic olanzapine
      versus haloperidol or placebo on anxious and depressive symptoms accompanying
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 803-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are a common feature of schizophrenia and may
      represent a core part of the illness. Where present, it has been associated with 
      greater overall morbidity and mortality. Monotherapy with conventional dopamine
      antagonists may either worsen or bestow a limited therapeutic benefit.
      Accordingly the use of adjunctive thymoleptics has been explored. In contrast,
      olanzapine (OLZ), an atypical antipsychotic agent, offers a distinctive and
      pleotropic pharmacology suggestive of a broader efficacy profile than
      conventional neuroleptic agents. METHODS: In a 6-week placebo- and haloperidol
      (HAL)-controlled trial with 335 randomized subjects with chronic schizophrenia in
      an acute exacerbation, three fixed dose ranges of OLZ (5, 10, or 15 +/- 2.5 mg)
      were evaluated versus HAL (10-20 mg) or placebo. RESULTS: Baseline to endpoint
      change in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale including the anxiety-depression
      cluster (items 1, 2, 5, 9) was analyzed. Two dose ranges of OLZ (10 +/- 2.5, 15
      +/- 2.5) were superior to placebo (p < 05) in improving mood status, whereas HAL 
      was not. CONCLUSION: Contributions from a more selective mesolimbic dopaminergic 
      profile, D1 or D4 activity, the release of dopamine/norepinephrine in the
      prefrontal cortex, and/or serotonin 5-HT2A,C antagonism may explain the
      differential benefit seen with OLZ in the treatment of comorbid anxious and
      depressive symptoms in schizophrenia.

TI  - Olanzapine in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder.
PG  - 119-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the response to olanzapine in 14 consecutive patients
      with bipolar I disorder who were inadequately responsive to standard psychotropic
      agents. METHODS: Fourteen patients with bipolar I disorder by DSM-IV criteria
      experiencing persistent affective symptoms inadequately responsive to at least
      one standard mood stabilizer were treated with open-label olanzapine by one of
      the authors. Response was assessed with the Clinical Global Impression Scale
      modified for use in bipolar disorder (CGI-BP). RESULTS: The 14 patients received 
      olanzapine at a mean (SD dosage of 14.1+/-7.2 (range 5-30) mg/day for a mean+/-SD
      of 101.4+/-56.3 (range 30-217) days of treatment. Of the 14 patients, 8 (57%)
      displayed much or very much overall improvement in their illness. In general,
      olanzapine was well tolerated. The most common side effects were sedation,
      tremor, dry mouth, and appetite stimulation with weight gain. LIMITATIONS: Data
      were obtained nonblindly and without a randomized control group, and olanzapine
      was added to ongoing psychotropic regimens. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine may have
      antimanic and mood-stabilizing effects in some patients with bipolar disorder,
      and is generally well tolerated. Controlled studies of olanzapine in bipolar
      disorder appear warranted.

TI  - Psychiatric hospital utilization in patients treated with clozapine for up to 4.5
      years in a state mental health care system.
PG  - 189-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We wished to study long-term psychiatric hospital utilization in a
      large sample of patients with schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective disorders who 
      were treated with clozapine for up to 4.5 years, and to determine whether or not 
      the reduction in hospital utilization we previously observed in smaller groups
      for up to 2.5 years was sustained with larger groups and in the longer term.
      METHOD: Patients in Texas state hospitals who had schizophrenia and/or
      schizoaffective disorder took either clozapine or traditional antipsychotics for 
      1.5 to 4.5 years. The number of patients in the clozapine group ranged from 383
      (1.5 years of treatment) to 29 (4.5 years). The group of patients who took
      traditional antipsychotics was made up of all patients (N = 233) with similar
      diagnoses, symptom severity, and duration of illness present in Texas state
      hospitals on an index day. RESULTS: The clozapine group showed a rapid and
      continuing decrease in hospital bed-days compared with controls who took
      traditional antipsychotics. The number of clozapine-treated patients who required
      little or no hospitalization during successive 6-month periods became significant
      (p < .0001) within 1.5 years, and continued to increase. Conversely, the number
      of patients taking clozapine who required virtually continuous state
      hospitalization decreased markedly compared with those taking traditional
      antipsychotics. CONCLUSION: Potential hospital cost savings are substantial, even
      though overall group results are diluted by clozapine nonresponders. Most
      treatment costs for clozapine nonresponders were related to hospital care; most
      or all of such costs would have been present in any event had these patients
      remained on traditional antipsychotic therapy. We believe a trial of clozapine
      therapy provides a low-cost opportunity for a highly effective and highly
      cost-saving outcome in those patients who will favorably respond to this therapy.
      We discuss clinical, social, and economic advantages of modern pharmaceutical
      treatments over traditional drugs.

PG  - 193-208
AB  - The neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia is becoming an important
      feature of research in the field. However, its major drawback is that it lacks
      any biochemical basis which might draw the diverse observations together. It is
      suggested that the membrane phospholipid hypothesis can provide such a
      biochemical basis and that the neurodevelopmental phospholipid concept offers a
      powerful paradigm to guide future research.

PG  - 101-5
AB  - This magnetoencaphalographic (MEG) study was conducted as part of a multicenter
      clinical trial to study the efficacy of aripiprazole. Participants included 5
      DSM-IV schizophrenia subjects and 10 age-matched normal controls. The
      schizophrenia subjects underwent a second MEG recording after 8 weeks of
      open-label treatment with aripiprazole. Overall, control subjects showed no
      abnormal spontaneous magnetic brain activity. At washout, 3 patients showed
      increased delta and theta activity along with paraxosymal bitemporal slow waves. 
      In 2 of these patients, the slow waves were generated in the superior temporal
      plane, as determined by dipole modeling. In the third patient, the slow waves
      appeared to have been generated at multiple regions throughout the temporal and
      inferior parietal lobes. As a group, schizophrenia patients, when compared with
      normal controls, demonstrated significant decreases in alpha peak frequency and
      power. Following treatment, aripiprazole had a significant normalizing effect on 
      delta and theta activity. Patients on aripiprazole continued to demonstrate
      significant abnormalities in alpha frequency and power.

TI  - Topographic analysis of EEG photic driving in patients with schizophrenia
      following clozapine treatment.
PG  - 73-8
AB  - Reduced EEG photic driving has been found to be diagnostically sensitive and
      specific for schizophrenia. Thirty-one patients with schizophrenia were tested in
      this study to identify the typical and atypical neuroleptic effects on the photic
      driving. Compared with the placebo, clozapine significantly enhanced the
      photically driven EEG in theta and low alpha frequency band, while haloperidol
      did not have the same effect. These changes with clozapine appeared to be
      symmetrical and located primarily in the frontal, central and mid-parietal areas 
      but not in the lateral parietal, temporal and occipital regions. Results were
      consistent with previous findings and suggested that the atypical EEG profile of 
      clozapine might be associated with 5-HT2 antagonistic property.

TI  - Risperidone: clinical outcome predictors and cost-effectiveness in a naturalistic
      setting.
PG  - 75-81
AB  - Although risperidone seems to be a safe and effective treatment for the
      management of psychotic symptoms, its acquisition cost is considerably higher
      than that of conventional antipsychotics, and its precise role in managing
      psychiatric illnesses has yet to be defined. The purpose of this investigation
      was to examine the relationship of patient demographic variables to therapeutic
      outcomes and to analyze the financial impact of risperidone on the treatment of
      psychotic symptoms. Subjects included in this 2-year, retrospective cohort,
      intent-to-treat analysis were all patients initiated on risperidone therapy at an
      inpatient psychiatric treatment facility. Clinical outcomes were assessed from
      the absolute change in hospitalized days, total number of psychotropic
      medications prescribed, and historic Clinical Global Impression severity scores. 
      Logistic regression analysis was conducted to analyze the potential relationship 
      to certain demographic variables to therapeutic response. The cost-benefit
      analysis compared the direct treatment costs incurred by the institution before
      and after risperidone initiation. Of the 66 patients originally started on
      risperidone, 57 completed a therapeutic trial. A clinical response was evident in
      54 percent of these patients overall. Logistic regression analysis identified
      previous treatment intolerance and a negative history of substance abuse as
      predictive of therapeutic success with risperidone (p = .0006 and p = .01,
      respectively). Hospitalization rates declined by 43 percent among treatment
      responders and by 1.3 percent among nonresponders resulting in a net annual
      savings of $147,962. Risperidone may be efficacious in many patients who had
      previously failed antipsychotic trials. Patients who had been unable to tolerate 
      traditional antipsychotics and those who lacked a documented history of substance
      abuse were uniquely responsive to risperidone treatment. The significant decline 
      in hospitalized days that was observed among responsive patients seems to
      indicate that risperidone may be a cost-effective approach to the management of
      psychotic symptoms.

TI  - The relationship between negative symptoms of schizophrenia and extrapyramidal
      side effects with haloperidol and olanzapine.
PG  - 71-4
AB  - Atypical neuroleptics present a unique opportunity to examine confounding by
      neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in the assessment of negative
      signs of schizophrenia. EPS, such as facial bradykinesia and akinesia, involve
      some of the same response systems and phenomena as emotional display channels.
      EPS are attributed to the blockade of dopamine receptors in the striatum by
      traditional neuroleptics. Newer atypical neuroleptics target primarily mesolimbic
      and mesocortical areas, and receptors for other transmitters such as serotonin.
      Olanzapine has been reported as less likely to cause EPS and may improve some
      negative signs. We investigated the relationship between measures of EPS and
      negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia treated with haloperidol or
      olanzapine. Patients were rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS) and the Simpson-Angus Scale EPS scale. Results show that the two agents
      have comparable efficacy but different safety outcomes. A positive correlation
      between EPS and PANSS negative score was detected in the haloperidol group only. 
      Stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that a big proportion of variability 
      in PANSS negative symptoms is predicted by EPS in the haloperidol group, but not 
      in the olanzapine group, even though EPS increased in patients treated with
      haloperidol but not in olanzapine patients.

TI  - Long-term efficacy and safety comparison of sertindole and haloperidol in the
      treatment of schizophrenia. The Sertindole Study Group.
PG  - 61-9
AB  - Sertindole is an atypical antipsychotic that is efficacious in schizophrenia and 
      is associated infrequently with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). This study
      assessed time to treatment failure with 24 mg/day sertindole or 10 mg/day
      haloperidol in 282 clinically stable neuroleptic-responsive outpatients with
      schizophrenia. During a 5-week transition period, patients were randomized to
      treatment with sertindole or haloperidol; other treatments were gradually
      discontinued. Patients then received treatment through Day 365. Time to treatment
      failure was numerically superior in sertindole-treated patients compared with
      haloperidol-treated patients, although this difference was not statistically
      significant. Sertindole-treated patients, however, remained free of
      hospitalization for exacerbation of schizophrenia and remained medically
      compliant significantly longer than did haloperidol-treated patients. In
      addition, there were significantly fewer reports of EPS in sertindole-treated
      patients and sertindole therapy was generally well tolerated. Patients
      transitioned well from other antipsychotic agents to sertindole. Sertindole
      appears to be an effective long-term treatment for schizophrenia.

TI  - Therapeutic equivalence of risperidone given once daily and twice daily in
      patients with schizophrenia. The Risperidone Study Group.
PG  - 103-10
AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether once-daily administration of
      risperidone was as effective and safe as twice-daily administration. In a
      double-blind 6-week trial, 211 patients with acute exacerbation according to
      DSM-III-R criteria were randomly assigned to receive risperidone at 8 mg once
      daily or 4 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy measure was the treatment
      response rate, defined as a 20% or greater reduction in total Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores. Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was
      assessed by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. The percentage of patients
      who showed a treatment response at endpoint was not significantly different
      between groups (76%, once-daily; 72%, twice-daily), nor was the median time to
      first treatment response (14 days, both groups). Significant reductions in PANSS 
      total and subscale scores and PANSS-derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were
      observed in both groups, with no significant between-group differences.
      Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale scores did not differ significantly between
      groups. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs,
      electrocardiograms, or clinical laboratory test results in either group. Gradual 
      dosage titration over the first 3 days of treatment was well-tolerated in both
      groups. The median trough plasma concentrations of risperidone,
      9-hydroxyrisperidone, and risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone were
      significantly lower with once-daily than with twice-daily administration; median 
      plasma concentrations measured within the first 8 hours after administration
      tended to be higher with once-daily administration. These differences did not
      affect the safety and efficacy of risperidone. Risperidone given once daily at 8 
      mg is as effective as twice-daily administration of 4 mg in the treatment of
      acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Both regimens were equally well-tolerated.

TI  - Binding of antipsychotic drugs to cortical 5-HT2A receptors: a PET study of
      chlorpromazine, clozapine, and amisulpride in schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 505-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the binding to cortical serotonin 5-HT2A receptors
      of conventional doses of the typical neuroleptic chlorpromazine in comparison
      with clozapine, the prototype atypical antipsychotic, and amisulpride, a specific
      dopamine D2-D3 blocker. METHOD: Seventeen schizophrenic patients treated with
      chlorpromazine (75-700 mg/day), four treated with clozapine (200-600 mg/day), and
      five treated with amisulpride (200-1200 mg/day) were studied. Cortical 5-HT2A
      binding was estimated by reference to the values for 14 antipsychotic-free
      schizophrenic subjects with the use of positron emission tomography and
      [18F]setoperone, a high-affinity radioligand for cortical 5-HT2A receptors.
      RESULTS: A dose-dependent decrease in the number of available cortical binding
      sites for [18F] setoperone was demonstrated in the chlorpromazine group; for the 
      highest dose, there was a virtual lack of sites available for binding. A very low
      percentage of available binding sites was also observed in the clozapine-treated 
      patients at all doses. This suggests a high level of 5-HT2A blockade with both
      clozapine and high doses of chlorpromazine. No significant binding of amisulpride
      to 5-HT2A receptors was detected. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of 5-HT2A receptor
      blockade does not appear specific to clozapine in comparison with high doses of
      chlorpromazine, suggesting that the distinct clinical profiles of both drugs are 
      unrelated to 5-HT2A blockade itself.

TI  - Risperidone versus clozapine in treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia: a
      randomized double-blind study. The Risperidone Study Group.
PG  - 499-504
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the short-term efficacy and
      safety of risperidone and clozapine in treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenic 
      patients. METHOD: In a controlled double-blind, multicenter study, 86 inpatients 
      with chronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R), who were resistant to or intolerant of
      conventional neuroleptics, were randomly assigned to receive risperidone or
      clozapine for 8 weeks after a 7-day washout period. After a 1-week dose-titration
      phase, doses were fixed at 6 mg/day of risperidone and 300 mg/day of clozapine
      for 1 week and then adjusted according to each patient's response. The final mean
      doses were 6.4 mg/day of risperidone and 291.2 mg/day of clozapine. Treatment
      efficacy and safety were evaluated with several well-known rating scales.
      RESULTS: Both risperidone and clozapine significantly reduced the severity of
      psychotic symptoms (scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the
      Clinical Global Impression scale) from baseline, with no significant
      between-group differences. At endpoint, 67% of the risperidone group and 65% of
      the clozapine group were clinically improved (reduction of 20% or more in total
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score). Risperidone appeared to have a
      faster onset of action. In both groups extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse 
      events were few, and their severity was generally mild. Neither group showed
      evidence of a relation between drug plasma concentrations and clinical
      effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone was well tolerated and as effective as
      medium doses of clozapine in patients with chronic schizophrenia who had been
      resistant to or intolerant of conventional neuroleptics.

PG  - 338-41
AB  - Forty schizophrenic patients treated with 50-600 mg/day of clozapine as
      monotherapy and 40 normal control subjects were tested for heart rate variability
      (HRV) which is mediated by the vagus nerve using acetylcholine as
      neurotransmitter. As compared to the control subjects, the patients showed
      essentially reduced HRV parameters which were negatively correlated with the
      plasma clozapine levels. Therefore, clozapine's anticholinergic effect is
      correlated to the plasma clozapine level when measured by the decrease of HRV. We
      suggest that HRV data might be useful as a predictor for plasma clozapine levels.

TI  - An open comparison of clozapine and risperidone in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine and risperidone are used in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. At present, there are few reported comparisons of these drugs in
      this population. We report on a consecutive series of treatment-resistant
      schizophrenics given either clozapine or risperidone in open clinical trials.
      METHOD: Subjects were treated with clozapine (n = 57) or risperidone (n = 29).
      Pretreatment GAF, CGI, and PANSS scores did not differ between the groups, nor
      did demographic variables including age, age at first hospitalization, years ill,
      number of previous hospitalizations, or gender. The mean treatment trial was 12.1
      weeks, with mean doses of clozapine 420 mg, and risperidone 7.75 mg. The length
      of the trial did not differ significantly between the groups. Response was taken 
      to be a 20% decrease in the PANSS score. RESULTS: Using repeated measures ANOVA, 
      PANSS total scores (F = 5.3, p = 0.02) and positive subscore (F = 7.4, p = 0.008)
      showed greater improvement in the clozapine group than the risperidone group,
      while other PANSS subscores showed a trend toward greater improvement with
      clozapine. The PANSS-derived factors of excitement (F = 6.7, p = 0.01),
      psychosocial withdrawal (F = 3.8, p = 0.05), and psychomotor retardation (F =
      3.9, p = 0.05) improved more in the group treated with clozapine. The GAF (F =
      10.9, p = 0.0014), CGI (F = 11.5, p = 0.0011), and CGI improvement (p = 0.0001)
      scores also improved more in the clozapine group. Of the clozapine group, 25
      (44%) responded, while 8 (28%) of the risperidone group responded to treatment.
      DISCUSSION: Clozapine had better efficacy in subjects with treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia compared to risperidone, although risperidone appears to yield
      better response rates than those previously reported for typical antipsychotics. 
      Double-blind, controlled trials of risperidone are needed to establish its
      efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol: II. Cost-effectiveness.
PG  - 196-213
AB  - Australia and Canada are currently the only Western nations with government
      guidelines for analyzing the cost-effectiveness of drugs. We used guidelines
      issued by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to construct 
      a model for comparing the cost-effectiveness of risperidone and haloperidol over 
      a 2-year period in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Use of clozapine was also
      included in the analysis as an alternative treatment given to patients who proved
      unresponsive to therapy with haloperidol or risperidone. Results are expressed in
      Australian dollars. Cost-effectiveness was determined by using decision-analytic 
      modeling to compare clinical outcomes and costs. The analytic model contained a
      decision tree for each of the compared agents that tracked the distribution of
      patients between treatment outcome pathways (i.e., scenarios). Distributions were
      based on probabilities derived from our meta-analysis results reported elsewhere 
      and from other sources. Each scenario had an associated monetary cost that
      included all significant direct costs (i.e., hospital costs; outpatient costs;
      and the cost of drugs, the services of health care professionals, and
      government-subsidized hostel accommodation). The cost for a given outcome was the
      sum of costs for all scenarios leading to that outcome. Cost-effectiveness was
      expressed as the total cost per favorable outcome. The definition of a favorable 
      outcome was one in which the patient was in a response phase at the end of the
      2-year period. The probability of a patient experiencing a favorable outcome at
      the end of 2 years was 78.9% for risperidone versus 58.9% for haloperidol. The
      total cost of treatment for 2 years was $15,549.00 for risperidone versus
      $18,332.00 for haloperidol. The expected cost per favorable outcome was
      $19,709.00 for risperidone and $31,104.00 for haloperidol. Risperidone was more
      cost-effective than haloperidol and therefore was "dominant" in pharmacoeconomic 
      terms because it produced a higher proportion of favorable outcomes at lower
      cost. Sensitivity analysis showed that the difference in clinical response rate
      was a key determinant of cost-effectiveness.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol: I. Meta-analysis of efficacy and safety.
PG  - 58-71
AB  - Haloperidol is widely considered a reference standard in antipsychotic therapy
      and is commonly used in comparative studies of the efficacy and safety of
      antipsychotic medication. Comparative clinical trials have shown that the novel
      antipsychotic agent risperidone tends to have greater efficacy (i.e., clinical
      response defined as a > or = 20% reduction in total scores on the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale) than haloperidol in patients with chronic schizophrenia 
      and poses less risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). We used DerSimonian and
      Laird's random-effects model to analyze pooled patient data from available
      randomized, double-masked, comparative trials of risperidone and haloperidol in
      patients with schizophrenia treated for at least 4 weeks at recommended doses.
      The purpose of the analysis was to determine whether there are significant
      overall differences in the rates of patient clinical response, prescription of
      anticholinergic agents, and treatment dropout. Six of the nine trials revealed in
      a literature search met all criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The
      meta-analysis showed that in patients with chronic schizophrenia, risperidone
      therapy is associated with significantly higher response rates, significantly
      less prescribing of anticholinergic medication, and significantly lower treatment
      dropout rates than haloperidol. These results demonstrate the greater treatment
      efficacy associated with risperidone compared with haloperidol and suggest both a
      lower incidence of EPS and improved treatment compliance.

TI  - Sulpiride augmentation in people with schizophrenia partially responsive to
      clozapine. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 569-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesised that a combined regimen of clozapine, a relatively
      weak D2-dopaminergic antagonist, and sulpiride, a selective D2 blocker, would
      demonstrate a greater antipsychotic efficacy by enhancing the D2 blockade of
      clozapine. METHOD: Twenty-eight people with schizophrenia, previously
      unresponsive to typical antipsychotics and only partially responsive to current
      treatment with clozapine, received, double-blind, 600 mg/day sulpiride or
      placebo, in addition to an ongoing clozapine treatment. The clinical status was
      evaluated before, during, and at the end of 10 weeks of sulpiride addition using 
      the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Positive
      Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression. RESULTS: The clozapine-sulpiride group exhibited
      substantially greater and significant improvements in positive and negative
      psychotic symptoms. About half of them, characterised by a younger age and lower 
      baseline SAPS scores, had a mean reduction of 42.4 and 50.4% in their BPRS and
      SAPS scores, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of patients with chronic
      schizophrenia may substantially benefit from sulpiride addition to clozapine.

TI  - The effects of clozapine on negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia with
      minimal positive symptoms.
PG  - 227-34
AB  - The effectiveness of clozapine in the treatment of the negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia remains controversial, as improvements in negative symptoms are
      invariably accompanied by improvements in positive symptoms and neurological side
      effects. We examined the effectiveness of treatment with clozapine on negative
      symptoms in a cohort of patients with minimal positive symptoms. Improvements in 
      positive and negative symptoms were measured by BPRS ratings in a subgroup of
      schizophrenic patients (n=17, from a state hospital cohort of 75) with minimal
      positive symptoms, who had received clozapine for 6 months. In this subgroup,
      significant improvements were noted by a composite score on the three negative
      symptom items of emotional withdrawal, blunted affect, and motor retardation.
      Positive and depressive symptoms remained unchanged. The remaining cohort (n=58) 
      showed improvements in overall psychopathology including positive, negative, and 
      depressive symptoms. Interestingly, nearly 50% of each group were discharged from
      the hospital. These findings suggest that clozapine may be beneficial in the
      treatment of core negative symptoms, even in the absence of other improvements in
      psychopathology. This effect of clozapine may be a function of its unique
      pharmacological profile.

TI  - New atypical antipsychotics. Experience and utility in the elderly.
PG  - 115-27
AB  - The atypical antipsychotics are a new class of agents with great promise for use 
      in the elderly because of their reduced propensity to cause acute extrapyramidal 
      adverse effects. Treatment of older patients with these agents, however, needs to
      take into consideration age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and the risks of 
      drug-drug interactions. Additionally, current evidence of their efficacy in
      late-life psychoses is derived largely from case series and from the
      extrapolation of results obtained in studies of younger patients with
      schizophrenia. Controlled clinical studies of atypical antipsychotics in elderly 
      patients are urgently needed.

TI  - Patterns of usual care for schizophrenia: initial results from the Schizophrenia 
      Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) Client Survey.
PG  - 11-20; discussion 20-32
AB  - To examine the conformance of current patterns of usual care for persons with
      schizophrenia to the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT)
      Treatment Recommendations, the PORT surveyed a stratified random sample of 719
      persons diagnosed with schizophrenia in two States. The types of treatment
      settings surveyed included acute inpatient programs and continuing outpatient
      programs in urban and rural locales. Using data from medical record reviews and
      patient interviews, the PORT assessed the conformance of current care with 12 of 
      the Treatment Recommendations. The rates at which patients' treatment conformed
      to the recommendations were modest at best, generally below 50 percent.
      Conformance rates were higher for pharmacological than for psychosocial
      treatments and in rural areas than in urban ones. Rates of Treatment
      Recommendation conformance for minority patients were lower than those for
      Caucasians, and patterns of care varied between the two States. The findings
      indicate that current usual treatment practices likely fall substantially short
      of what would be recommended based on the best evidence on treatment efficacy.
      This disparity underscores the need for greater efforts to ensure that treatment 
      research results are translated into practice.

      Team (PORT) treatment recommendations.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - Beginning in 1992, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and the
      National Institute of Mental Health funded the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes
      Research Team (PORT) to develop and disseminate recommendations for the treatment
      of schizophrenia based on existing scientific evidence. These Treatment
      Recommendations, presented here in final form for the first time, are based on
      exhaustive reviews of the treatment outcomes literature (previously published in 
      Schizophrenia Bulletin, Vol. 21, No. 4, 1995) and focus on those treatments for
      which there is substantial evidence of efficacy. The recommendations address
      antipsychotic agents, adjunctive pharmacotherapies, electroconvulsive therapy,
      psychological interventions, family interventions, vocational rehabilitation, and
      assertive community treatment/intensive case management. Support for each
      recommendation is referenced to the previous PORT literature reviews, and the
      recommendations are rated according to the level of supporting evidence. The PORT
      Treatment Recommendations provide a basis for moving toward "evidence-based"
      practice for schizophrenia and identify both the strengths and limitations in our
      current knowledge base.

TI  - Olanzapine: interaction study with imipramine.
PG  - 971-8
AB  - Olanzapine is an "atypical" antipsychotic agent with a high affinity for
      serotonin 5HT2A/C, 5HT3, 5HT6, and dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4 receptors. Depressed
      patients with psychotic disorders frequently require treatment with concomitant
      antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. Imipramine pharmacokinetics serve
      as a marker for hepatic CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A activity. An open-label, three-way 
      randomized crossover study was done to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      and potential for a drug interaction between olanzapine (5 mg) and imipramine (75
      mg). Each drug was administered alone and in combination. Nine healthy men, ages 
      32 to 54 years, enrolled in the study. Psychomotor performance capacities, plasma
      olanzapine, imipramine, desipramine concentrations, and clinical laboratory tests
      were measured. Pharmacokinetic variables, vital signs, subjective tests for
      liveliness, and psychomotor outcomes were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA.
      Olanzapine was safe. Sedation, postural hypotension, and minor vital sign
      alterations occurred during all treatments. On the liveliness questionnaire,
      patients generally reported poorer (less lively) scores with olanzapine alone or 
      coadministered with imipramine versus baseline scores. These effects disappeared 
      within 24 hours after administration. Olanzapine alone and in combination
      decreased motor-speed tasks (finger tapping and visual-arm random reach) compared
      with baseline or imipramine treatment. Peak 6-hour changes were statistically
      significant but clinical importance was only marginal. Olanzapine concentrations 
      were < 19% greater than with imipramine. But olanzapine did not affect the
      kinetics of imipramine or desipramine and, therefore, did not show a metabolic
      drug interaction involving CYP2D6.

TI  - The dopamine D3 receptor (DRD3) Ser9Gly polymorphism and schizophrenia: a
      haplotype relative risk study and association with clozapine response.
PG  - 72-5
AB  - Several lines of evidence suggest that the dopamine D3 receptor is involved in
      the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The D3 receptor gene (DRD3) contains a
      polymorphism resulting in a serine-glycine substitution in the N-terminus of the 
      receptor. Shaikh and colleagues have reported a significant association between
      the DRD3 Ser9 allele and the Ser9/Ser9 genotype with schizophrenia in 133
      Caucasians. In a meta-analysis of previous studies, Ser9 and the Ser9/Ser9
      genotype were found to be significantly associated with schizophrenia, although
      these investigators could not confirm reports of excess homozygosity at this
      locus in schizophrenia. These authors also report that, in an unblinded study,
      the Ser9/Ser9 genotype was more frequent in patients who did not respond to
      clozapine. These data represent the most comprehensive examination of DRD3
      Ser9Gly in schizophrenia to date. We have therefore determined DRD3 Ser9Gly
      genotypes in 58 patients with schizophrenia and in their parents. Moreover, we
      have genotyped 68 schizophrenics participating in double-blind clozapine trials. 
      We do not find that Ser9 is preferentially transmitted in schizophrenia, cannot
      confirm excess DRD3 homozygosity in schizophrenia, and do not replicate the
      association between DRD3 and clozapine response. These data suggest that allelic 
      variation in DRD3 may not play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia or 
      in clozapine response.

TI  - Modification of the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale for use in bipolar
      illness (BP): the CGI-BP.
PG  - 159-71
AB  - The Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) was modified specifically for use in 
      assessing global illness severity and change in patients with bipolar disorder.
      Criticisms of the original CGI were addressed by correcting inconsistencies in
      scaling, identifying time frames for comparison, clarifying definitions of
      illness severity and change, and separating out assessment of treatment side
      effects from illness improvement during treatment. A Detailed User's Guide was
      developed to train clinicians in the use of the new CGI-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) 
      for rating severity of manic and depressive episodes and the degree of change
      from the immediately preceding phase and from the worst phase of illness. The
      revised scale and manual provide a focused set of instructions to facilitate the 
      reliability of these ratings of mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness
      during treatment of an acute episode or in longer-term illness prophylaxis.
      Interrater reliability of the scale was demonstrated in preliminary analyses.
      Thus, the modified CGI-BP is anticipated to be more useful than the original CGI 
      in studies of bipolar disorder.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interactions of clozapine with selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors: differential effects of fluvoxamine and paroxetine in a prospective
      study.
PG  - 2-9
AB  - Pharmacokinetic interactions of clozapine and its metabolites
      N-desmethylclozapine and clozapine N-oxide with the selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs) fluvoxamine and paroxetine were investigated in a prospective 
      study in schizophrenic patients under steady-state conditions. Thirty patients
      were treated with clozapine at a target dose of 2.5 to 3.0 mg/kg of body weight. 
      After gradual dose escalation, serum concentrations of clozapine and two
      metabolites were determined twice at 7-day intervals after steady-state
      conditions had been reached. Then, fluvoxamine (50 mg/day) or paroxetine (20
      mg/day) was added in 16 and 14 patients, respectively. Serum concentrations of
      clozapine and its metabolites were measured after 1, 7, and 14 days of
      coadministration with the SSRI. Mean trough concentrations of steady-state serum 
      concentrations of clozapine, N-desmethylclozapine, and clozapine N-oxide were
      markedly elevated under fluvoxamine by about threefold of baseline concentrations
      whereas paroxetine induced only minor, nonsignificant changes. Estimation of the 
      mean elimination half-life of clozapine 2 weeks after start of fluvoxamine
      comedication revealed an increase from 17 hours to about 50 hours whereas there
      was no change under paroxetine coadministration. The
      N-desmethylclozapine/clozapine ratio did not change significantly with either
      SSRI. Under monotherapy, clozapine mean serum concentrations in smokers were
      significantly lower by 32% compared with nonsmokers. Similarly, N-demethylation
      ratios were about 20 to 50% higher in smokers. Thus, in all patients, fluvoxamine
      induced relevant increases in serum concentrations of clozapine and its
      metabolites, probably by the inhibition of enzymes catalyzing the degradation of 
      clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine, whereas paroxetine, at a usual clinically
      effective dosage of 20 mg/day, did not cause significant pharmacokinetic
      interactions.

PG  - 69-83
AB  - The introduction of antipsychotics for the management of schizophrenia greatly
      improved the quality of life of many patients suffering from this debilitating
      disease. Although typical antipsychotic drugs represent a significant advancement
      in psychopharmacology, they carry a heavy side effect burden, have little
      efficacy in the management of negative symptoms, and are ineffective in about
      one-third of patients with schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotic agents
      characterized the next major advancement in pharmacotherapy. They differ from
      typical antipsychotics in their mechanism of action, side effect profiles, and
      clinical efficacy. Sertindole is a new atypical antipsychotic.

PG  - 9-15
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of a high-fat meal on the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the novel atypical antipsychotic drug
      ziprasidone. DESIGN: Open, randomized, three-way crossover study. SETTING:
      University-based research facility. SUBJECTS: Eight healthy male volunteers.
      INTERVENTIONS: Ziprasidone 20 mg was administered under fasting conditions
      (treatment A), and directly after (treatment B) and 2 hours after (treatment C) a
      standard high-fat breakfast. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serial blood samples 
      were obtained over 36 hours. Three objective psychometric tests were employed to 
      evaluate daytime vigilance at baseline and 2 hours after each dose. Ziprasidone
      had a significant effect on area under the curve (AUC0-infinity), maximum serum
      concentration, and half-life (analysis of variance all p<0.05), with the mean
      AUC0-infinity being significantly greater (627.2 +/- 206.4 vs 371.0 +/- 126.5 ng 
      x hr/ml, ANOVA with Bonferroni's criteria p<0.016) and half-life significantly
      shorter (4.7 +/- 0.8 vs 6.6 +/- 1.3 hrs, ANOVA with Bonferroni's criteria
      p<0.016) after treatment B compared with treatment A. Although similar trends
      were observed after treatment C compared with treatment A, the differences did
      not reach statistical significance when Bonferroni's correction criteria were
      applied (p>0.016). CONCLUSION: These data suggest an increase in systemic
      exposure to the highly lipophilic compound ziprasidone when taken after fatty
      foods, possibly due to improved drug dissolution and solubilization. The drug's
      longer half-life under fasting conditions may reflect dissolution-limited
      absorption, although this could not be directly assessed. Despite postprandial
      increases in ziprasidone AUC0-infinity and maximum concentration, daytime
      vigilance was not affected.

TI  - Altered consciousness states and endogenous psychoses: a common molecular
      pathway?
PG  - 257-65
AB  - Interest in the role of indolamines in the pathogenesis of psychoses has been
      renewed in recent years by the development of atypical antipsychotic drugs such
      as clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone, which act on serotonin receptors.
      Discovery of the hallucinogenic compounds called methylated indolealkyalamines
      (MIAs) (e.g. N,N-dimethylserotonin, or bufotenin, and N,N-dimethyltryptamine, or 
      DMT) led proponents of the transmethylation hypothesis of schizophrenia to
      theorize that through some inborn error of metabolism, serotonin or tryptamine
      might undergo the addition of extra methyl radicals, thereby forming MIAs with
      hallucinogenic properties. Various studies have attempted to detect the excretion
      of MIAs, especially DMT, in the body fluids of psychotic patients and normal
      controls. Some of these studies have demonstrated elevated MIA concentrations in 
      psychotic patients, including those with schizophrenia, compared with normal
      persons, and others have not. A number of variables may account for these
      contradictory findings. The mechanism whereby the beverage ayahuasca, which is
      used in certain cure and divination rituals in the Amazon Basin, exerts its
      hallucinogenic effects may serve as a model to explain the mechanism underlying
      hallucinogenic symptoms in schizophrenia and may lend support to the
      transmethylation hypothesis. Certain studies suggest that specific perceptual
      disturbances manifested by schizophrenic patients could contribute to progressive
      deterioration and negative symptomatology. All these findings point to the need
      for further study of the neurophysiology of MIAs and their pathogenetic role in
      endogenous psychoses.

TI  - The new antipsychotics, and their potential for early intervention in
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 207-22
AB  - Over almost four decades, few fundamentally different antipsychotic drugs evolved
      to challenge classical neuroleptics as the mainstay of the pharmacotherapy of
      schizophrenia. However, the recent re-emergence of clozapine, together with the
      emergence of risperidone, portends an increasing number of new antipsychotics
      which are now either traversing the stages of regulatory approval or else
      well-advanced in clinical development. This article first evaluates the
      significance of clozapine and risperidone; it then reviews some of the new
      antipsychotics and how they might be classified vis-a-vis potential advantages
      for patients, outlines putative mechanisms and new therapeutic targets, and
      considers whether such agents may act on any disease process inherent to
      schizophrenia. One fundamental issue is the extent to which the new
      antipsychotics might shift materially the risk benefit balance towards
      intervention, not just at the earliest possible stage following the onset of
      psychosis but at a yet earlier, 'prodromal' phase of the disorder where there is 
      a considerably greater likelihood of 'treating' behavioural disturbances that
      prove not to be the harbingers of psychotic illness.

TI  - Factors influencing relapse in the long-term course of schizophrenia.
PG  - 199-206
AB  - Highly effective neuroleptic drugs have been available for the past 40 years, but
      50% of schizophrenic patients, under normal treatment conditions, relapse within 
      1 year after their latest episode, frequently spending 15-20% of their time in
      psychiatric institutions. The term relapse usually refers to a deterioration or
      recurrence of positive rather than negative features, and relapses appear to
      impair the course of the disease. Impairment is often longer than expected for
      those patients who discontinue antipsychotic medication and then relapse to their
      prediscontinuation clinical state of function. Drug therapy is an important
      defense against relapse. Marked differences in relapse rate between patients
      receiving placebo and neuroleptic drugs have been observed (approximately 69%
      after 1 year for the placebo group versus 26% for the neuroleptic group).
      First-year relapse rates can be reduced from 75% to 15% with prophylactic
      treatment with neuroleptics. Follow-up studies suggest that noncompliance with
      medication, pharmacological factors, psychosocial factors and alcohol and drug
      abuse contribute to setting off new psychotic episodes. The most important of
      these is noncompliance with medication. The overwhelming majority of
      schizophrenic patients who suffered a clinical exacerbation and required
      hospitalization (73%) did not comply with the treatment prescribed. The effect of
      new antipsychotic agents should be examined in patients who relapse despite
      maintenance treatment with conventional neuroleptics. We have found that the rate
      of current drug abuse among patients with schizophrenic relapse (44%) was
      significantly higher than that in schizophrenic patients who regularly attended
      outpatient clinics. Also, the rate of alcohol and substance abuse is higher in
      males (79%) than in females (21%). Psychiatric units should integrate addiction
      treatments with psychotic-relapse management.

TI  - [Long-term clinical experience with clozapine].
PG  - 385-96
AB  - This study reports a clinical experience among twenty schizophrenic patients
      treated by clozapine during two years and eight months within a range extending
      from three months to seven years. These twenty patients had previously shown
      long-term resistance to usual neuroleptics but three out of them met the
      diagnosis of mental retardation or childhood disintegrative disorder (F.84.3-ICD 
      10). These patients were put under clozapine for their violent behavior. The
      methodology was retrospective, descriptive with intra-individual comparison, each
      patient being his own reference before and after treatment. Diagnosis met CD 10
      criteria and were assessed without using standard examination. This study aimed
      at assessing once more clozapine efficacy and tolerance upon a long time follow
      up. Single therapy has been the rule and dosages have been progressively
      increased reaching a mean daily dosage of 350 mg per day. The efficacy, assessed 
      by the way of BPRS, GAF (DSM III-R) and simplified form of CGIS, has been
      verified in approximately 30% of the patients, mainly concerning positive
      symptoms. Clozapine was also able to alleviate severe behavior troubles brought
      about by delusional states, without this latter being markedly softened when it
      was a long term one. Clozapine tolerance has shown it to be satisfactory, however
      we noticed the occurrence of a leucopenia with neutropenia after seventeen weeks 
      of treatment, followed, some days later, by a Quincke oedema, which forced to
      interrupt the treatment. White blood cells came back in a normal range fifteen
      days later. The other side effects (transitory hypersialorrhea, tachycardia,
      without clinical and ECG perturbations) have been usually well tolerated and have
      never caused treatment interruption. No extrapyramidal side effect have been
      noticed among our twenty patients. The end of this paper consists in the
      presentation of four clinical cases: one about the efficacy of clozapine upon
      violent antisocial behaviour in a schizotypital disorder; one delusional chronic 
      schizophrenic patient whose violence has been controlled despite of the delusion;
      one paranoid schizophrenic patient who has been able to maintain a satisfactory
      professional and family adaptation; and finally a childhood disintegrative
      disorder (F.84.3-ICD 10) in whom occurred the only leucopenia side effect of our 
      study. These four clinical cases have seemed particularly meaningful regarding
      our clinical experience of clozapine which has been lasting for almost seven
      years now.

PG  - 360-6
AB  - The purpose of this cohort pilot study was to compare the resource utilization
      and economic outcomes associated with the use of risperidone versus haloperidol
      in a naturalistic setting. Patient charts from a large psychiatric group practice
      were reviewed, and hospital billing data were obtained. Patients meeting the
      inclusion criteria were placed into one of two cohorts depending on their
      medication history. Thirty patients treated with risperidone met the selection
      criteria, and a random quota sampling technique was used to allow for a matched
      control cohort of 30 patients treated with haloperidol. In the haloperidol and
      risperidone cohorts, 24 and 28 patients, respectively, were evaluated
      statistically. Mean utilization rates and costs per patient per month for each
      service were estimated by using regression analysis. Patients in the risperidone 
      cohort had significantly fewer hospitalizations than did those in the haloperidol
      cohort (P = 0.004). Likewise, risperidone patients had significantly lower
      hospitalization costs than haloperidol patients (P = 0.005). Conversely, patients
      treated with risperidone visited the physician more frequently than did those
      treated with haloperidol (P = 0.0005). Estimated mean total monthly costs were
      $123.34 lower (95% confidence interval = $464, $217) per patient in the
      risperidone cohort than in the haloperidol cohort ($1,636.11 vs $1759.45; P =
      0.4693). Significant reductions in hospital costs in the risperidone cohort
      offset higher medication and physician costs. Overall, total monthly costs were
      similar for the two cohorts.

TI  - The effects of risperidone on the five dimensions of schizophrenia derived by
      factor analysis: combined results of the North American trials.
PG  - 538-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: In two double-blind trials conducted in North America, 513 patients
      with chronic schizophrenia received risperidone, haloperidol, or placebo. In the 
      present study, combined data from the two trials were analyzed. METHOD: Patients 
      were randomly assigned to receive placebo, fixed doses of risperidone (2, 6, 10, 
      and 16 mg/day) or 20 mg/day of haloperidol for 8 weeks. Factor analysis of scores
      on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) produced five dimensions
      (negative symptoms, positive symptoms, disorganized thought, uncontrolled
      hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression), similar to the five dimensions of 
      previous factor-analytic studies of PANSS data. RESULTS: Mean changes (symptom
      reductions) in PANSS factor scores from baseline to treatment Weeks 6 and 8 were 
      significantly greater in patients receiving 6-16 mg/day of risperidone than in
      patients receiving placebo or haloperidol. The advantages of risperidone were
      greatest for negative symptoms, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and
      anxiety/depression. Even at the lowest dose, 2 mg/day, risperidone was
      significantly (p < or = .05) superior to haloperidol in reducing negative
      symptoms. The differences in outcomes between risperidone and haloperidol on
      PANSS scores were not related to extrapyramidal symptoms. CONCLUSION: Risperidone
      produced significantly (p < or = .05) greater improvements than haloperidol on
      all five dimensions. The large between-group differences on negative symptoms,
      hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression suggest that risperidone and other
      serotonin/dopamine antagonists have qualitatively different effects from those of
      conventional antipsychotic agents.

TI  - Differential effect of haloperidol and clozapine on plasma homovanillic acid in
      elderly schizophrenic patients with or without tardive dyskinesia.
PG  - 20-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) changes in response to a challenge of 
      several days with haloperidol have been found to be predictive of the therapeutic
      response to haloperidol over a longer period of treatment. METHODS: Twenty-six
      elderly women who gave informed consent were divided into two groups, with or
      without tardive dyskinesia, and subjected to an 80-day washout, after which both 
      the dyskinetic and nondyskinetic group was divided, and half of each group given 
      haloperidol or clozapine. CONCLUSIONS: The nondyskinetic group had a brief rise
      in plasma HVA, then a decline. The dyskinetic group had no change in plasma HVA. 
      Neither group challenged with clozapine had any change in plasma HVA.

TI  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and CNS drug interactions. A critical
      review of the evidence.
PG  - 454-71
AB  - The potential for drug-drug interactions in psychiatric patients is very high as 
      combination psychopharmacotherapy used to treat comorbid psychiatric disorders,
      to treat the adverse effects of a medication, to augment a medication effect or
      to treat concomitant medical illnesses. Interactions can be pharmacodynamic or
      pharmacokinetic in nature. This paper focuses on the metabolic kinetic
      interactions between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other
      central nervous system (CNS) drugs. The evidence for and clinical significance of
      these interactions are reviewed, with special emphasis on antipsychotics,
      tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Many psychotropic medications have
      an affinity for the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes which promote elimination by
      transforming lipid soluble substances into more polar compounds. SSRIs serve both
      as substrates and inhibitors of these enzymes. In vitro studies provide a
      screening method for evaluating drug affinities for substrates, inhibitors or
      inducers of CYP enzymes. Although in vitro data are important as a starting point
      for predicting these metabolic kinetic drug interactions, case reports and
      controlled experimental studies in humans are required to fully evaluate their
      clinical significance. Several factors must be considered when evaluating the
      clinical significance of a potential interaction including: (a) the nature of
      each drugs' activity at an enzyme site (substrate, inhibitor or inducer); (b) the
      potency estimations for the inhibitor/inducer; (c) the concentration of the
      inhibitor/inducer at the enzyme site; (d) the saturability of the enzyme; (e) the
      extent of metabolism of the substrate through this enzyme (versus alternative
      metabolic routes); (f) the presence of active metabolites of the substrate; (g)
      the therapeutic window of the substrate; (h) the inherent enzyme activity of the 
      individual, phenotyping/genotyping information; (i) the level of risk of the
      individual experiencing adverse effects (e.g. the elderly) and (j) from an
      epidemiological perspective, the probability of concurrent use. This paper
      systematically reviews both the in vitro and in vivo evidence for drug
      interactions between SSRIs and other CNS drugs. As potent inhibitors of CYP2D6,
      both paroxetine and fluoxetine have the potential to increase the plasma
      concentrations of antipsychotic medications metabolised through this enzyme,
      including perphenazine, haloperidol, thioridazine and risperidone in patients who
      are CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers. Controlled studies have demonstrated this for 
      perphenazine with paroxetine and haloperidol with fluoxetine. Fluvoxamine, as a
      potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, can inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, resulting in
      higher plasma concentrations. Drug interactions between the SSRIs and tricyclic
      antidepressants (TCAs) can occur. Fluoxetine and paroxetine, as potent inhibitors
      of CYP2D6, can increase the plasma concentrations of secondary and tertiary
      tricyclic antidepressants. Sertraline and citalopram are less likely to have this
      effect. Fluvoxamine can increase the plasma concentrations of tertiary TCAs.
      Fluvoxamine inhibits, via CYP3A. CYP2C19 and CYP1A2, the metabolism of several
      benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, bromazepam and diazepam. Fluoxetine
      increases the plasma concentrations of alprazolam and diazepam by inhibiting
      CYP3A and CYP2C19, respectively. The clinical importance of the interaction with 
      diazepam is attenuated by the presence of its active metabolite. Sertraline
      inhibits these enzymes only mildely to moderately at usual therapeutic doses.
      Therefore the potential for interactions is less; however, the in vivo evidence
      is minimal. Paroxetine and citalopram are unlikely to cause interactions with
      benzodiazepines. The evidence is conflicting for an interaction between
      carbamazepine and the SSRIs fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. These combinations should
      be used cautiously, and be accompanied by monitoring for adverse events and carb

TI  - Olanzapine plasma concentrations and clinical response in acutely ill
      schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 472-7
AB  - Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic effective in the treatment of
      schizophrenic patients. After a 2- to 9-day placebo lead-in, 79 inpatients with
      schizophrenia according to DSM-III-R criteria were placed on an olanzapine dosage
      of 10 mg/day or 1 mg/day for up to 6 weeks. Blood samples were obtained weekly
      during this period. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses of Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale rating
      scale data suggested a minimum effective therapeutic concentration of 9 ng/mL.
      Using an intent-to treat analysis, 45% of the patients with olanzapine plasma
      concentrations > or = 9.3 ng/mL responded (> or = 20% decrease in BPRS), whereas 
      only 13% of the patients with concentrations < 9.3 ng/mL responded. Use of
      olanzapine plasma concentrations of > 9 ng/mL as a predictor for treatment
      response in acutely ill schizophrenic patients is practicable because this
      therapeutic marker significantly increases the likelihood of a patient responding
      to olanzapine.

TI  - Effects of clozapine on plasma catecholamines and relation to treatment response 
      in schizophrenia: a within-subject comparison with haloperidol.
PG  - 317-25
AB  - We conducted a within-subject comparison of the effects of clozapine and
      haloperidol on plasma levels of neurotransmitters and metabolites, and related
      changes in specific plasma neurochemicals with clozapine response. The subjects
      were 14 inpatients with schizophrenia or schzoaffective disorder, who were
      refractory to haloperidol and at least one other typical antipsychotic
      medication. Subjects underwent, in the following order: a 6-week "fixed, flexible
      dose" haloperidol trial, followed by a 2-4 week medication-free phase, and a
      6-week clozapine trial. Plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE), homovanillic acid
      (HVA), and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and objective clinical ratings
      of total, positive, negative, and depressive symptoms were obtained at the end of
      each phase. As expected, we found a substantial increase of plasma NE with
      clozapine but not with haloperidol. However, the increase in NE was not
      associated with improvement in total or positive symptomatology. There was some
      evidence for an association between improvement in negative symptoms and
      increased HVA on clozapine, as well as diminished HVA during the medication-free 
      phase. The implications of these data for understanding the mechanisms of action 
      of clozapine are discussed.

TI  - Standard olanzapine versus placebo and ineffective-dose olanzapine in the
      maintenance treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 1571-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Two studies compared the efficacy of standard-dose oral olanzapine (5 
      to 15 mg a day) with placebo and with ineffective-dose olanzapine (1 mg a day) in
      maintenance therapy of schizophrenia. METHODS: The studies were 46-week
      double-blind extensions of multicenter studies that assessed the efficacy of
      olanzapine in the acute treatment of schizophrenia. Subjects were 120 adults who 
      met DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia with an acute exacerbation and who had a
      minimum score of 24 on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, who had responded to
      acute therapy (defined as at least a 40 percent reduction in the BPRS score from 
      baseline or a score of 18 or less during up to six weeks of treatment), and who
      were outpatients at their last acute-phase visit. Relapse was defined as
      hospitalization for psychopathology. Relapse risk was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier
      survival analysis and life table analysis. Patients who relapsed were
      discontinued from the studies. RESULTS: In the first study (N = 58), patients in 
      the standard-dose olanzapine group experienced a significantly lower relapse risk
      (p = .002) over one year than patients treated with placebo. The estimated
      one-year risk of relapse with olanzapine was 28.6 percent, compared with 69.9
      percent with placebo. Results were similar in the second study (N = 62); patients
      treated with standard-dose olanzapine had a significantly reduced risk of relapse
      (p = .018) over one year compared with patients treated with ineffective-dose
      olanzapine. The estimated one-year risks of relapse were 19.6 percent for
      standard-dose olanzapine and 45.5 percent for ineffective-dose olanzapine.
      CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine is superior to placebo and ineffective-dose olanzapine in

TI  - Olanzapine: a new antipsychotic agent with efficacy in the management of
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 1325-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy data, and
      adverse effects of olanzapine as a treatment for schizophrenia and to determine
      the advantages and disadvantages of this atypical antipsychotic agent compared
      with currently marketed agents. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE computer literature
      search was conducted to retrieve all English-language studies and review articles
      involving olanzapine published as of October 1, 1996. The manufacturer of the
      drug, Eli Lilly and Company, provided the clinical investigator's brochure and
      abstracts of unpublished Phase III clinical trials. STUDY SELECTION: Animal
      studies evaluating the pharmacology of olanzapine were evaluated, as were all
      open-label and double-blind studies involving the evaluation of olanzapine for
      the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. DATA EXTRACTION: All available
      clinical studies were reviewed and the interpretation of data for each study was 
      influenced by the size of the study sample, the nature of the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, and the data analysis techniques used. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Olanzapine is a thienobenzodiazepine analog with an in vitro receptor affinity
      profile similar to that of clozapine. Olanzapine exhibits linear kinetics over
      the dosage range studied and is extensively metabolized in humans. Clinical
      evaluations to date have shown olanzapine to be at least as efficacious as
      typical antipsychotic agents in the treatment of the acute phase of
      schizophrenia. The drug was well tolerated, with significantly fewer
      extrapyramidal adverse effects than haloperidol. Current data suggest that
      olanzapine may be more effective than haloperidol for the treatment of negative
      symptoms; moreover, preliminary data suggest that fewer relapses occur over the
      course of treatment in patients treated with olanzapine compared with those
      taking haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: The exact place of olanzapine in the therapy of 
      psychotic patients remains unclear, as more data are needed to evaluate the
      long-term efficacy of this agent, its impact on negative symptoms, and its
      potential use in patients resistant to the standard agents. Despite limitations
      in the current database, olanzapine is a promising treatment option for patients 
      with schizophrenia.

TI  - An open trial of valproate for agitation in geriatric neuropsychiatric disorders.
PG  - 344-51
AB  - The authors assessed the efficacy, tolerability and safety of open valproate
      administration in a group of elderly patients with agitation and neuropsychiatric
      disorders (N = 13), most of whom had dementia (n = 12). Dosing was individualized
      according to the response of target symptoms and side effects. Clinical Global
      Impression of Change (vs. baseline) measured efficacy. This open treatment
      suggested that valproate reduced agitated behaviors in some patients, and is well
      tolerated; thus, results warrant a larger, randomized, placebo-controlled study.

TI  - PET evidence that loxapine is an equipotent blocker of 5-HT2 and D2 receptors:
      implications for the therapeutics of schizophrenia.
PG  - 1525-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Loxapine, a dibenzoxazepine antipsychotic, is closely related to
      clozapine and shares clozapine's high affinity for binding to serotonin 5-HT2 and
      dopamine D4 receptors. The purpose of this study was to document loxapine's 5-HT2
      and D2 receptor occupancy in vivo in patients with psychoses. METHOD: Ten
      patients who were taking loxapine (10-100 mg/day) had their D2 and 5-HT2
      receptors assessed by means of positron emission tomography with [11C]raclopride 
      and [18F]setoperone, respectively. RESULTS: The D2 receptor occupancy ranged from
      43% to 90%; 5-HT2 occupancy varied from 27% to near saturation. Statistical
      comparison of the results showed that loxapine was equipotent in blocking 5-HT2
      and D2 receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Loxapine differs from typical neuroleptics in
      demonstrating a high degree of 5-HT2 receptor occupancy. However, it is not
      "atypical" like clozapine and risperidone, since its 5-HT2 occupancy is not
      higher than its D2 occupancy. The results demonstrate that a high level of 5-HT2 
      occupancy is not a sufficient condition for atypicality. If atypical
      antipsychotic action is predicated on a combination of 5-HT2 and D2 effects, then
      it requires > 80% 5-HT2 occupancy in conjunction with < 80% D2 occupancy.

TI  - A comparison of quetiapine and chlorpromazine in the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 265-73
AB  - A 6-week, double-blind, randomized, multicentre, parallel-group study was
      conducted to compare the efficacy of quetiapine ('Seroquel') (n=101) with that of
      chlorpromazine (n=100) in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of
      subchronic or chronic schizophrenia, or schizophreniform disorder. The
      tolerabilities of the two treatments were also compared. The mean daily doses of 
      quetiapine and chlorpromazine at the end of the study were 407 mg and 384 mg,
      respectively. Both treatments were effective in the treatment of positive and
      negative symptoms, with a trend towards superior efficacy for quetiapine. The
      quetiapine group had a lower incidence of adverse events than the chlorpromazine 
      group, and a low incidence of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms.
      Quetiapine was not associated with a sustained increase in serum prolactin. These
      clinical data support the preclinical profile of quetiapine as an atypical
      antipsychotic agent.

TI  - Mortality in current and former users of clozapine.
PG  - 671-7
AB  - Clozapine (Clozaril), a tricyclic dibenzodiazepine, causes fewer extrapyramidal
      side effects than do other antipsychotic drugs. Because it can induce
      agranulocytosis, however, clozapine is indicated only for schizophrenia that is
      not responsive to other therapies. To describe the drug's effects on mortality,
      we compared rates of various causes of death in 67,072 current and former
      clozapine users. We linked data from a national registry of clozapine recipients 
      to the National Death Index and Social Security Administration Death Master
      Files, obtained death certificates, and calculated mortality rates for underlying
      causes of death using standardization to adjust for age, sex, and race. During
      1991-1993, there were 396 deaths in 85,399 person-years for patients ages 10-54
      years. Mortality was lower during current clozapine use than during periods of
      non-use. Mortality from suicide was decreased in current clozapine users by
      comparison with past users [rate ratio (RR) = 0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      = 0.10-0.30]. During clozapine use, there were elevations in mortality rates for 
      less common causes of death, including pulmonary embolism (RR for current
      exposure compared with past clozapine use = 5.2) and respiratory disorders (RR = 
      2.9). Clozapine appears to reduce mortality in severe schizophrenics, mostly by
      decreasing suicide rates.

TI  - Clozapine blunts N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist-induced psychosis: a study with 
      ketamine.
PG  - 664-8
AB  - Several lines of evidence suggest that the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA) receptor is involved in the antipsychotic efficacy of the atypical
      antipsychotic agent clozapine. Clinical data on the interaction between
      clozapine's mechanism of action and NMDA receptor function have been lacking
      secondary to a paucity of pharmacologic probes of the NMDA system. We have
      utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled infusion paradigm with subanesthetic 
      doses of the NMDA antagonist ketamine to test the hypothesis that clozapine would
      blunt ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Ten
      schizophrenic patients underwent ketamine infusions while antipsychotic drug free
      and also during treatment with clozapine. Antipsychotic drug-free patients
      experienced increases in ratings of positive and negative symptoms. Clozapine
      treatment significantly blunted the ketamine-induced increase in positive
      symptoms. These data suggest that NMDA receptor function may be involved in the
      unique antipsychotic efficacy of clozapine.

TI  - Effects of exogenous melatonin administration and withdrawal in five patients
      with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder.
PG  - 383-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ready availability of exogenous melatonin means that its use in
      patients with mood disorders is probably not uncommon. Nonetheless, few
      controlled trials of exogenous melatonin in these patients have been conducted.
      METHOD: Five patients with rapid-cycling DSM-III-R bipolar disorder were treated 
      with melatonin 10 mg q.d. at 10:00 p.m. for 12 weeks. Melatonin was added to a
      stable regimen of medication and administered in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled fashion. RESULTS: Melantonin administration had no positive
      effects. One patient developed a free-running (unentrained) sleep-wake cycle
      after melatonin withdrawal. In addition, in both this and a second patient, there
      is evidence that the administration of exogenous melatonin may have suppressed
      the secretion of endogenous melatonin. CONCLUSION: The administration of
      melatonin had no significant effects on mood or sleep. However, melatonin
      withdrawal delayed sleep onset time and may have had some mild mood-elevating
      effects.

TI  - Blind, controlled, long-term study of the comparative incidence of
      treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia with olanzapine or haloperidol.
PG  - 1248-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tardive dyskinesia is a serious and common complication of neuroleptic
      treatment. Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic agent exhibiting regional
      mesolimbic dopaminergic selectivity and a broad-based pharmacology encompassing
      serotonin, dopamine, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptor binding affinities. The 
      authors' goal was to compare the incidence of tardive dyskinesia among patients
      receiving olanzapine and those receiving the conventional dopamine 2 antagonist
      haloperidol. METHOD: Data were analyzed from three actively controlled and blind 
      long-term responder studies of subjects meeting DSM-III-R criteria for
      schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder treated
      with olanzapine (N = 707, up to 20 mg/day, 237 median days of exposure) or
      haloperidol (N = 197, up to 20 mg/day, 203 median days of exposure) who did not
      have evidence of tardive dyskinesia at baseline. All of the subjects had a
      chronic disease course (mean greater than 10 years), and there were no
      significant between-treatment group differences in demographic or disease
      characteristics. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale and research diagnostic 
      criteria for tardive dyskinesia were used to define the comparative incidence
      rates of long-term treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia. RESULTS: The incidence 
      of newly emergent tardive dyskinesia at any visit after baseline, at the final
      visit, and at the final two clinical assessments was statistically significantly 
      lower among olanzapine-treated patients than among haloperidol-treated patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings support an atypical extrapyramidal symptom profile
      and the potential of a significantly lower risk of tardive dyskinesia with
      olanzapine than with haloperidol among patients requiring maintenance
      antipsychotic treatment.

TI  - Time to clozapine response in a standardized trial.
PG  - 1243-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine the time to clozapine response in
      treatment-refractory patients with schizophrenia. METHOD: Antipsychotic response 
      to a clozapine trial was examined in 50 treatment-refractory schizophrenic
      inpatients. Subjects were treated with clozapine for at least 12 months,
      regardless of response status, according to a standardized, increasing dose
      protocol. Behavioral changes were measured through monthly assessments with the
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. RESULTS: Thirty-four subjects (68%) met clinical 
      response criteria by the end of the trial. Response was achieved at a mean dose
      of 468 mg/day (SD = 168). The dose of 30 (88%) of the responding patients was 600
      mg/day or less. The mean time to response was 82 days (SD = 100, range = 10-401).
      It took an average of 60 days (SD = 87) for subjects to reach the dose at which
      clozapine response was achieved. Once this dose was reached, the average response
      time was 17 days (SD = 14, range = 2-56). All 34 subjects who responded met
      criteria within 8 weeks of a clozapine dose escalation. No late response was
      found in the remaining 16 subjects despite a mean follow-up period of 75 weeks
      (SD = 50). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, all patients who responded to clozapine
      did so within 8 weeks of a change in dose. Thus, there appears to be little
      clinical gain in prolonging exposure to clozapine beyond 8 weeks at any
      particular dose if no response is seen.

TI  - In vivo immunomodulatory effects of clozapine in schizophrenia.
PG  - 221-5
AB  - Recently, there have been some reports that schizophrenia is accompanied by an
      immune-inflammatory response, characterized by increased secretion of
      interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2) and lower plasma levels of
      CC16 (Clara cell protein), an endogenous anti-cytokine. It was shown that
      clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, may increase the plasma levels of
      sIL-2R and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This study was carried out in order to
      examine serum IL-6, IL-6R, CC16, IL-1R antagonist (IL-1RA), transferrin receptor 
      (TfR) and sCD8 antigen, both before and after treatment with clozapine in
      schizophrenic subjects versus normal controls. Schizophrenic patients showed
      significantly higher plasma IL-6R and IL-1RA and lower plasma CC16 than normal
      controls. Treatment with clozapine significantly increased plasma sCD8, IL-6,
      CC16 and IL-1RA concentrations. The clozapine-induced increments in plasma IL-6
      and CC16 appeared during the first 2 weeks of treatment, whereas the increases in
      plasma sCD8 and IL-1RA appeared after 5 weeks. Clozapine appears to have complex 
      in vivo immunomodulatory effects.

      exacerbation of schizophrenia: a comparison with haloperidol and placebo. The
      Seroquel Trial 13 Study Group.
PG  - 233-46
AB  - Five fixed doses of the atypical antipsychotic "Seroquel" (quetiapine) were
      evaluated to delineate a dose-response relationship, as measured by changes from 
      baseline in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression
      (CGI), and Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) summary 
      scores, and to compare efficacy and tolerability opposite placebo and
      haloperidol. Three hundred sixty-one patients from 26 North American centers
      entered this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with acute exacerbation of
      chronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R). Patients who completed a single-blind, placebo
      washout phase were randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine (75, 150,
      300, 600, or 750 mg daily), haloperidol (12 mg daily), or placebo and evaluated
      weekly for 6 weeks. At end point, significant differences (p < 0.05, analysis of 
      covariance) in adjusted mean changes from baseline were identified between the
      four highest doses of quetiapine and placebo for BPRS total, BPRS
      positive-symptom cluster, and CGI Severity of Illness item scores and between
      quetiapine 300 mg and placebo for SANS summary score. Differences between
      quetiapine and haloperidol were not significant. Dose-response modeling showed
      significant linear and quadratic functions of quetiapine dose for all primary
      efficacy variables. Notably, no significant safety concerns were identified as
      dose increased. Quetiapine was no different from placebo across the dose range
      studied regarding incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms or change in prolactin
      concentrations. Quetiapine is well tolerated and clinically effective in the
      treatment of schizophrenia. It is both superior to placebo and comparable to
      haloperidol in reducing positive symptoms at doses ranging from 150 to 750 mg/day
      and in reducing negative symptoms at a dose of 300 mg/day.

TI  - Methylene blue adjuvant therapy of schizophrenia.
PG  - 357-63
AB  - There is growing interest in the role of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in
      idiopathic psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. In this preliminary study, 
      we examined the therapeutic efficacy of methylene blue (MB), a "downstream"
      inhibitor of one of NO's actions, administered orally as an adjuvant to
      conventional neuroleptic medications. Specifically, MB blocks NO's activation of 
      soluble guanylyl cyclase. MB has previously been reported to have therapeutic
      effects in the treatment of psychosis and mania. Preclinical data also suggest
      that MB might possess antipsychotic potential. Participants in the current study 
      were eight patients with schizophrenia who had incomplete responses to
      conventional antipsychotics (as evidenced by a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
      [BPRS] total score of 35 or more). These patients completed a 4-week open-label
      study with a 1 week "off", 2 week "on", and one final week "off" design. Measures
      of treatment efficacy were the BPRS, Schedule for the Assessment of Negative
      Symptoms, and Clinical Global Improvement Scale administered weekly. Final scores
      for each outcome measure item were based on the consensus of at least two trained
      raters present during each rating interview. A statistically significant, albeit 
      modest, decrease in the severity of psychopathology was observed while the
      subjects were taking MB, and psychopathology significantly worsened when MB was
      discontinued. The results suggest a need for further study with MB or perhaps
      other NO-dependent guanylyl cyclase-inhibiting medications.

TI  - Economic and health state utility determinations for schizophrenic patients
      treated with risperidone or haloperidol.
PG  - 298-307
AB  - The current study uses utility analysis to assess economic and quality-of-life
      benefits of risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia. A retrospective
      analysis was performed on Positive and Negative Syndrome Symptoms (PANSS) data
      obtained from the published Canadian multicenter risperidone trial (part of the
      North American trial). Cluster analysis applied to endpoint PANSS scores,
      including all patients (N = 135), identified three clusters representing 130
      patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptomatology. A narrative health state
      profile was written for each cluster, and 100 psychiatric nurses from Washington,
      DC, were asked to assign preference ratings to each one using linear analog and
      standard gamble (SG) methods. Mean utility values (confidence interval 95%)
      obtained from the SG ratings for the three health state profiles were 0.61 +/-
      0.069 (mild); 0.36 +/- 0.073 (moderate); and 0.29 +/- 0.071 (severe). The mild
      health state (including the majority of risperidone 6 mg-treated patients) was
      rated by nurses to have a 0.25 +/- 0.0501 greater utility than the moderate
      health state (composed of the majority of haloperidol-treated patients). The
      results of these utility evaluations (SG) by the nurses were related to the
      clinical outcome for three of the six drug treatment groups (N = 65) by
      multiplying the percentage of patients in each of the three clusters, both at
      baseline and end-point, who were receiving risperidone 6 mg/day, haloperidol, or 
      placebo, by the utility value for the health state assigned to that cluster. The 
      gain in utility for risperidone-treated patients was 2.6 times higher (0.125)
      compared with haloperidol-treated patients (0.049), and 7 times higher compared
      with placebo (-0.021). After multiplying the gain in utility of each treatment by
      the remaining expected life span for men and women, it was found that
      risperidone-treated patients obtained more than twice as many quality-adjusted
      years as haloperidol patients. The incremental drug treatment cost divided by the
      incremental benefit of risperidone versus haloperidol was found to yield a
      favorable, generally accepted cost-utility ratio.

TI  - The acute and long-term effect of olanzapine compared with placebo and
      haloperidol on serum prolactin concentrations.
PG  - 41-54
AB  - Prolactin elevation is both a common and a persistent event with the currently
      marketed antipsychotics, excluding clozapine. Elevations have been associated
      with both acute (galactorrhea, amenorrhea) and chronic (predisposition to
      osteoporosis) treatment-emergent adverse events. One of the defining criteria for
      an atypical antipsychotic is the relative lack of persistent prolactinemia. A
      double-blind, placebo- (N = 68) and haloperidol- (Hal: 15 +/- 5 mg/day, N = 69)
      controlled trial of three dose ranges of olanzapine (Olz-L: 5 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N =
      65; Olz-M: 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N = 64; Olz-H: 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N = 69) in the
      treatment of schizophrenia afforded the opportunity to assess the temporal course
      of the influence of olanzapine and haloperidol on serum prolactin concentration. 
      Consistent with its potent D2 antagonism, haloperidol was associated with a
      statistically significantly higher incidence of treatment-emergent prolactin
      elevation (72%) than seen with placebo (8%; p < 0.001) at week 2 of therapy.
      Expectedly, this elevation was also persistent at weeks 4 and 6. In contrast,
      olanzapine-associated treatment-emergent prolactin elevations were both lower in 
      magnitude and transient. At week 2, 38% of the Olz-H, 24% of the Olz-M, and 13%
      of the Olz-L treatment groups exhibited a treatment-emergent prolactin elevation,
      with a mean increase of 0.35, 0.52, and 0.61 nmol/l, respectively; for
      haloperidol the mean increase was 1.23 nmol/l. For only the Olz-M and the Olz-H
      treatment groups did the week 2 incidence of treatment-emergent prolactin
      elevations differ statistically significantly from placebo. Both the incidence of
      elevations and the mean increase, in prolactin concentration were less than that 
      seen with haloperidol. Furthermore, by treatment week 6, all three olanzapine
      groups exhibited incidences of treatment-emergent prolactin elevation that were
      comparable to placebo and were statistically significantly less than observed
      with haloperidol. Rapid adaptation was observed in the temporal course of
      prolactin elevations associated with olanzapine based on both the categorical
      analysis of treatment-emergent high values and the analyses of temporal change in
      mean concentrations. In contrast to haloperidol, the magnitudes of the
      treatment-emergent elevations associated with olanzapine were minimal. The rates 
      of elevation were approximately one-half to one-third those observed with
      haloperidol and were significantly more transient. Olanzapine, even at the
      highest doses (15 +/- 2.5 mg/day) used, was not associated with persistent
      elevations of prolactin, consistent with an 'atypical' pharmacologic profile.

TI  - Clozapine-induced electroencephalogram changes as a function of clozapine serum
      levels.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Specific electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during clozapine therapy were
      prospectively studied in a cohort of 50 chronic state hospital patients with
      schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to one of three nonoverlapping clozapine
      serum level ranges (50-150 ng/mL, 200-300 ng/mL, and 350-450 ng/mL). EEGs were
      obtained before clozapine was instituted, and after 10 weeks of treatment.
      Fifty-three percent of patients showed EEG changes during the 10-week study
      period. We observed three seizures (6%), one in a patient on 900 mg (serum level 
      320 ng/mL) clozapine, and two in patients with lower clozapine serum levels
      (200-300 ng/mL) who had prior histories of seizures and inadequate valproate
      coverage. Thirteen percent of patients developed spikes with no relationship to
      dose or serum level of clozapine. Fifty-three percent of patients developed
      slowing on EEG. Compared to plasma levels below 300 ng/mL, a clozapine serum
      level between 350 and 450 ng/mL led to more frequent and more severe slowing. The
      EEG slowing correlated with observed sleepiness, although this factor was not
      sufficient to explain the severity of high-dose effects.

TI  - [Cost effectiveness analysis of olanzapine versus haloperidol in the treatment of
      schizophrenia++ in Spain].
PG  - 225-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness of olanzapine in comparison with haloperidol, in
      Spanish schizophrenic patients, was analysed using a clinical decision model.
      METHODS: The model represents a simulation of the different clinical and
      therapeutic possibilities that an hypothetical cohort of patients could
      experienced in a 5-years period of treatment. Efficacy was measured as months
      with partial-complete remission. Most information was obtained from the HGAJ
      randomised clinical trial. Other information was estimated through literature
      reviews and the opinion of an expert panel. RESULTS: Average cost-effectiveness
      for olanzapine was lower (116,476 pesetas per month with partial-complete
      remission) than for haloperidol (134,762 pesetas per month with partial-complete 
      remission). Olanzapine produced more than half year (6.7 months) with partial
      complete remission, in comparison with haloperidol, with antincrementar
      cost-effectiveness of 32,516 pesetas per month with partial-complete remission,
      in comparison with haloperidol. The results were not sensitive to changes in the 
      values of the main variables used in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: According to this
      analysis, olanzapine presents a good cost-effectiveness relationship in
      comparison with baloperidol, in Spanish schizophrenic patients. The analysis will
      be completed when new studies comparing olanzapine with other antipsychotics are 
      available.

TI  - The influence of clozapine treatment on plasma granulocyte colony-stimulating
      (G-CSF) levels.
PG  - 118-21
AB  - The antipsychotic drug clozapine frequently induces transient increases in white 
      blood cell counts that have been found to be sensitive, but non-specific,
      predictors of subsequent life-threatening agranulocytosis. Granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is an endogenous hematopoietic growth factor
      that plays a pivotal role in granulopoiesis. In addition, G-CSF has successfully 
      been used to treat clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. We performed a longitudinal
      investigation of the plasma levels of G-CSF in 20 schizophrenic patients during
      six weeks of clozapine treatment. Clozapine transiently increased plasma G-CSF
      levels in 55% of the subjects studied. This effect was most prominent at the end 
      of the second week of treatment. Increased G-CSF levels were accompanied by
      increased granulocyte and monocyte counts, increased rectal temperature and
      increased plasma levels of other cytokines and cytokine receptors. The results
      presented suggest that G-CSF is involved in clozapine-induced increases in
      granulocyte counts seen early during treatment. Like granulocytosis,
      granulocytopenia is known to occur in conjunction with increased systemic G-CSF
      levels. Therefore, we hypothesize that a persistent increase along with a decline
      in white cell counts following an early spike during clozapine treatment might
      predict the occurrence of agranulocytosis.

TI  - Quality of life and response of negative symptoms in schizophrenia to haloperidol
      and the atypical antipsychotic remoxipride. The Canadian Remoxipride Group.
PG  - 244-8
AB  - In a large, multicenter, double-blind study of the effect of haloperidol and the 
      atypical antipsychotic remoxipride on improvement of negative symptoms in
      schizophrenia, quality of life was also assessed using a modified version of the 
      Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). Compared with previous studies, this study had a
      longer duration (28 weeks), and the dose of the comparator, haloperidol, was much
      lower. At the end of the study, compared with the baseline, both treatment groups
      reported comparable improvement in negative symptoms as defined by the protocol
      (at least 20% improvement). Similarly, both groups showed comparable changes on
      global and multidimensional self-assessments of quality of life. All the
      subfactors of the modified version of the SIP were similar in both groups, except
      for the subfactor that relates to alertness behavior, which possibly reflects
      remoxipride's lack of any sedating properties compared with haloperidol. This
      study presents an approach for inclusion of quality of life as an outcome measure
      in the design of clinical trials of new antipsychotic medications.

TI  - Sertindole hydrochloride: a novel antipsychotic medication with a favorable side 
      effect profile.
PG  - 691-3
AB  - Forty percent of all long-term care hospitalization days are accounted for by
      patients with schizophrenia. New approaches to managing this disorder are needed,
      including improved efficacy and better tolerability to enhance compliance with
      treatment. Sertindole hydrochloride is a novel antipsychotic medication soon to
      be available in the United States and Canada. As part of multisite phase II and
      III studies, we studied effects of this medication in five patients with chronic 
      schizophrenia and examined the side effect profile. With more than 30
      patient-months of exposure, sertindole treatment was not associated with
      neurologic side effects and was well tolerated in all patients studied. No
      evidence of hematologic abnormalities was found. Serial electrocardiograms
      revealed slight increases in QTc that were not considered clinically significant 
      and did not lead to discontinuance of treatment. While data from larger samples
      are needed, in this small population sertindol hydrochloride was tolerated well
      with no evidence of acute neurologic side effects associated with traditional
      treatments for schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia may benefit from
      enhanced compliance with treatment and a possible reduction in hospitalizations
      in the future.

TI  - Heterogeneity of serotonergic response in treatment-refractory schizophrenia
      patients.
PG  - 6-12
AB  - Oral metachlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) as a direct-acting postsynaptic
      serotonergic agonist was used to study serotonergic dysfunction in
      treatment-refractory chronic schizophrenia based on the hypothesis that some
      patients may show central serotonergic hypersensitivity. Seventeen DSM-III-R
      chronic schizophrenic patients with a history of neuroleptic nonresponse
      underwent double-blind challenge with oral m-CPP (0.25 mg/kg body weight) and
      placebo after medication washout: m-CPP significantly elevated both prolactin and
      cortisol levels as compared to placebo. There was a significant relationship
      between change in cortisol level and change in psychopathology under m-CPP; a
      blunted cortisol response was associated with a decrease in total
      psychopathology, while an increase in cortisol response related to an increase in
      psychopathology. Similarly, decrease in severity of the activation factor and the
      hostility factor was associated with a smaller cortisol response in the m-CPP
      condition. These results point to heterogeneity in central serotonergic
      sensitivity within the context of different subpopulations of serotonergic
      receptors.

TI  - Antipsychotic use in pregnancy. What are the best treatment options?
PG  - 403-10
AB  - Both the rapid emergence of new antipsychotic medications and the increasing
      fertility rate among women with psychotic disorders have contributed to the
      growing clinical importance of the treatment of pregnant women who have psychotic
      illnesses. The treatment of this patient population must always take into
      consideration the effect of that treatment on the fetus. With regard to the high 
      risk of decompensation during pregnancy and postpartum, continuous antipsychotic 
      medication is needed using the minimum effective dose. The use of high-potency
      agents appears to be preferable for first-line management, as there are few data 
      regarding the use of atypical agents such as clozapine in pregnancy. Guidelines
      for treating pregnant women with psychoses vary little from those for nonpregnant
      patients. Clinicians must always carefully weigh up the risks and benefits for
      each patient on an individual basis.

TI  - Low dose of clozapine in the treatment of dopaminergic psychosis in Parkinson's
      disease.
PG  - 204-9
AB  - Dopaminergic psychosis frequently complicates the pharmacological treatment of
      Parkinson's disease. Dose reduction of dopaminomimetic therapy or treatment with 
      conventional neuroleptics improves psychosis but worsens parkinsonism. In an
      open-label 12-month trial, the clinical antipsychotic efficacy of the atypical
      neuroleptic clozapine was investigated in 36 parkinsonian patients (age range
      46-85 years) with symptoms of dopaminergic psychosis including delusions, vivid
      dreams, hallucinations, frank paranoid delirium, and hypersexuality. Clozapine,
      given orally at bedtime, was started at a dose of 6.25 mg and titrated upward to 
      the minimal effective dose. In all patients, psychosis responded to very low
      clozapine doses (mean 10.59 +/- 6.48 mg/day). Clozapine doses correlated with the
      severity of psychosis. During clozapine treatment, parkinsonian disabilities and 
      levodopa dosage remained statistically unchanged. During the 12-month study, no
      patient had clozapine-induced agranulocytosis or other severe side effects. These
      findings indicate that even at low doses, clozapine effectively controls
      dopaminergic psychosis in Parkinson's disease patients without compromising motor
      function.

TI  - Psychopharmacologic treatment of pathologic aggression.
PG  - 427-51
AB  - Several drugs are apparently effective in treating pathologic anger and
      aggression. Because many of the studies on aggressive populations allowed the use
      of concomitant medications, it is unclear whether the efficacy of each drug in a 
      particular population is dependent on the presence of other medications, such as 
      antipsychotic agents. Finally, one needs to be circumspect in inferring efficacy 
      of a particular drug in aggressive patients with neuropsychiatric conditions
      other than the ones in which some efficacy has been established. Lithium appears 
      to be an effective treatment of aggression among nonepileptic prison inmates,
      mentally retarded and handicapped patients, and among conduct-disordered children
      with explosive behavior. Certainly, lithium would be the treatment of choice in
      bipolar patients with excessive irritability and anger outbursts, and it has been
      shown to be effective in this population. Anticonvulsant medications are the
      treatment of choice for patients with outbursts of rage and abnormal EEG
      findings. The efficacy of these drugs in patients without a seizure disorder,
      however, remains to be established, with the exception perhaps of valproate and
      carbamazepine. In fact, dyphenylhydantoin did not appear to be effective in
      treating aggressive behavior in children with temper tantrums and was found to be
      effective in only a prison population. There is some evidence for the efficacy of
      carbamazepine and valproate in treating pathologic aggression in patients with
      dementia, organic brain syndrome, psychosis, and personality disorders. As
      Yudofsky et al point out in their review of the literature, although traditional 
      antipsychotic drugs have been used widely to treat aggression, there is little
      evidence for their effectiveness in treating aggression beyond their sedative
      effect in agitated patients or their antiaggressive effect among patients whose
      aggression is related to active psychosis. Antipsychotic agents appear to be
      effective in treating psychotic aggressive patients, conduct-disordered children,
      and mentally retarded patients, with only modest effects in the management of
      pathologic aggression in patients with dementia. Furthermore, at least in one
      study, these drugs were found to be associated with increased aggressiveness in
      mentally retarded subjects. On the other hand, atypical antipsychotic agents
      (i.e., clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine) may be more effective than
      traditional antipsychotic drugs in aggressive and violent populations, as they
      have shown efficacy in patients with dementia, brain injury, mental retardation, 
      and personality disorders. Similarly, benzodiazepines can reduce agitation and
      irritability in elderly and demented populations, but they also can induce
      behavioral disinhibition. Therefore, one should be careful in using this class of
      drugs in patients with pathologic aggression. Beta-blockers appear to be
      effective in many different neuropsychiatric conditions. These drugs seem
      effective in reducing violent and assaultive behavior in patients with dementia, 
      brain injury, schizophrenia, mental retardation, and organic brain syndrome. As
      pointed out by Campbell et al in their review of the literature, however,
      systematic research is lacking, and little is known about the efficacy and safety
      of beta-blockers in children and adolescents with pathologic aggression. Although
      widely used in the management of pathologic aggression, the use of this class of 
      drugs has been limited partially by marked hypotension and bradycardia, which are
      side effects common at the higher doses. The usefulness of the antihypertensive
      drug clonidine in the treatment of pathologic aggression has not been assessed
      adequately, and only marginal benefits were observed with this drug in irritable 
      autistic and conduct disorder children. Psychostimulants seem to be effective in 
      reducing aggressiveness in brain-injured patients as well as in violent
      adolescents with oppositional or conduct disorders, particu

TI  - The effects of a selective D4 dopamine receptor antagonist (L-745,870) in acutely
      psychotic inpatients with schizophrenia. D4 Dopamine Antagonist Group.
PG  - 567-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Based mainly on the selective antagonism of clozapine at D4 compared 
      with D2 dopamine receptors, hopes have run high that a selective D4 dopamine
      receptor antagonist might improve the pharmacological treatment of patients with 
      schizophrenia. We report, to our knowledge, the first multicenter study of the
      antipsychotic potential of a highly specific D4 dopamine receptor antagonist (ie,
      L-745,870) in patients with acute schizophrenia. METHODS: Thirty-eight acutely
      psychotic and neuroleptic responsive (by history) newly admitted inpatients with 
      schizophrenia were randomized to 4 weeks of double-blind treatment (2:1) with
      either L-745,870 (n = 26), 15 mg/d, or placebo (n = 12) after a 3- to 5-day
      placebo run-in period. RESULTS: Overall, a greater percentage of patients
      receiving L-745,870 compared with patients receiving placebo discontinued the
      study for insufficient therapeutic response (32% vs 16%). At the end of 4 weeks
      by last observation carried forward analysis, the mean change from baseline to
      week 4 on the total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale favored placebo (i.e., -8
      points [-15% change from baseline] vs -1 point [-2% change from baseline] for
      placebo vs L-745,870, P = .09). Similar differences in favor of placebo in
      changes from baseline mean scores were observed for the not carried forward
      analysis on the total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (P < .03), for not carried
      forward and last observation carried forward analyses on the sum of selected
      positive symptom items of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and for the
      Clinical Global Impression analysis (P = .03, last observation carried forward). 
      A greater percentage of patients receiving L-745,870 had scores indicative of
      some level of worsening (compared with baseline) on the total Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions' Severity of Illness Scale as
      well as positive symptoms compared with those receiving placebo. CONCLUSION: The 
      selective D4 dopamine receptor antagonist L-745,870 was ineffective as an
      antipsychotic for the treatment of neuroleptic responsive inpatients with acute
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Quetiapine in patients with schizophrenia. A high- and low-dose double-blind
      comparison with placebo. Seroquel Study Group.
PG  - 549-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel [ICI 204,636]) is an atypical
      dibenzothiazepine antipsychotic with a greater affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine2 
      (5-HT2) receptors than for D2 dopamine receptors; its efficacy in patients with
      schizophrenia was shown in early phase 2 trials (maximum dose, 750 mg/d).
      METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 286
      patients hospitalized with chronic or subchronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were
      randomized to 6 weeks of treatment with high-dose quetiapine fumarate (< or = 750
      mg/d), n = 96; low-dose quetiapine fumarate (< or = 250 mg/d), n = 94; or
      placebo, n = 96. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global
      Impression Severity of Illness item scores were the primary efficacy variables.
      Secondary efficacy variables included the BPRS positive-symptom cluster score,
      the Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms summary score (United 
      States only), and the total score from the negative scale of the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (Europe only). Scores were analyzed using an analysis of 
      covariance for change from baseline at end point with last observations carried
      forward. The model included baseline score (covariate), center, and treatment.
      Extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed using the Simpson-Angus Scale and the
      Barnes Akathisia Scale; abnormal involuntary movements were assessed using the
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Frequency distributions of grouped
      change-from-baseline scores were analyzed using chi 2 tests. RESULTS: Of 280
      patients in whom the efficacy of quetiapine was evaluated, 159 (42% of those
      receiving high-dose treatment; 57%, low-dose treatment; and 59%, placebo)
      withdrew before trial completion, primarily because of treatment failure.
      Significant (P < .001, BPRS; P = .003, Clinical Global Impression Severity of
      Illness item; and P = .003, BPRS positive-symptom cluster) differences were
      identified between patients receiving high-dose quetiapine and placebo for both
      primary efficacy variables, with end point differences in the BPRS
      positive-symptom cluster score showing quetiapine's consistency in reducing
      positive symptoms. The reduction of negative symptoms was less consistent;
      high-dose quetiapine was superior on the Modified Scale for the Assessment of
      Negative Symptoms but not on the negative scale of the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale. Quetiapine was well tolerated and did not induce extrapyramidal
      symptoms, sustained elevations of prolactin, or clinically significant changes in
      hematologic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Quetiapine is an effective antipsychotic
      with a favorable safety profile. The optimum dose is probably greater than 250
      mg/d.

      presented. A first step in optimising treatment is an increase in the awareness
      and implementation of existing treatment standards. The introduction of clozapine
      challenges the view that all antipsychotics are of similar efficacy; the drug has
      an established superiority over some of the traditional antipsychotics in
      treatment-resistant patients. Newer agents such as zotepine, risperidone,
      quetiapine, olanzapine and sertindole, which have a lower risk of producing
      extrapyramidal motor symptoms, have been developed in the wake of clozapine.
      While it is still common to switch nonresponding patients to an antipsychotic of 
      a different chemical class, clozapine treatment remains the only strategy based
      on sound scientific evidence in these patients, although the novel antipsychotics
      give rise to hope. Alternatively, combination treatment with benzodiazepines,
      lithium or an anticonvulsant has been employed. If treatment with a depot
      antipsychotic is planned, it is advisable to start a patient on the oral form of 
      the same drug in order to obtain dose requirements and tolerability information
      of the drug in that patient. Long term maintenance therapy is crucial and
      continuous monitoring for the development of adverse effects essential.

TI  - Extrapyramidal symptoms in patients treated with risperidone.
PG  - 194-201
AB  - Data on extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) from both arms of the North American
      multicenter comparative study of risperidone, placebo, and haloperidol were
      analyzed. The subjects were 523 patients with chronic schizophrenia who, after a 
      1-week washout period, received placebo, risperidone (2, 6, 10, or 16 mg/day), or
      haloperidol (20 mg/day) for 8 weeks; the trial was completed by 253 patients.
      Severity of EPS was assessed by means of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale 
      (ESRS). Mean changes (increases) in ESRS scores from baseline to worst score were
      significantly lower in each risperidone group than the haloperidol group on the
      total ESRS (parkinsonism + dystonia + dyskinesia), total parkinsonism,
      hypokinetic symptoms, and on the questionnaire (p < 0.001). On several of the
      subscales (dyskinesia, buccolinguomasticatory, and Clinical Global Impression
      severity of dyskinesia), mean change scores were significantly lower in some of
      the risperidone groups than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). At the clinically
      most effective risperidone dose (6 mg/day), the mean ESRS change score was not
      significantly different from that of the placebo group. A significant linear
      relationship was noted between mean change scores and increasing risperidone dose
      on 4 of the 12 ESRS subscales; nevertheless, even at 16 mg/day of risperidone,
      mean change scores were lower than in the haloperidol group. A linear
      relationship between increasing risperidone dose and use of antiparkinsonian
      medications was also apparent. Acute dystonic reactions occurred both in patients
      receiving risperidone and haloperidol. Patients with severe baseline EPS were at 
      higher risk of EPS during the study than patients with low or moderate baseline
      EPS. It is concluded that low doses of risperidone cause few or no EPS and
      recommendations for initiation of risperidone treatment are made.

TI  - Relapse in young paranoid schizophrenic patients: a prospective study of
      stressful life events, P300 measures, and coping.
PG  - 792-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated the relationship of cognitive and coping
      characteristics to stressful life events at the time of relapse in patients with 
      recent-onset paranoid schizophrenia. METHOD: Over 6 years, the authors collected 
      data on 41 schizophrenic outpatients aged 18-28 years at recruitment. The
      patients were rated prospectively every 2 weeks with the Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of
      Positive Symptoms, Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and life events
      measures. The Frankfurt Questionnaire of Complaints was used to analyze
      subjective complaints regarding cognitive and coping abilities. The P300 auditory
      event-related potential was measured at recruitment to provide an index of
      information-processing capability. RESULTS: Patients without severe life events
      during the 1 month before relapse had a smaller P300, more subjective complaints,
      and less coping capacity than did relapsed schizophrenic subjects who had severe 
      life events in the month before relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Relapses in subjects
      without severe life events were associated with fewer cognitive resources and
      less coping ability. Patients with normal P300 and adequate coping resources
      seemed to be able to deal better with stressful life events.

TI  - A double-blind comparative study of clozapine versus chlorpromazine on Chinese
      patients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia.
PG  - 123-30
AB  - Clozapine has been shown to have superior effectiveness compared with classic
      neuroleptics in treating refractory schizophrenia in Caucasians, but its efficacy
      and safety in Chinese have not been adequately studied. Forty Chinese
      schizophrenic patients were recruited in a 12-week, double-blind, comparative
      trial. Twenty-one patients were randomly assigned to clozapine treatment and 19
      to chlorpromazine treatment. The average dose was 543 +/- 157 and 1163 +/- 228
      mg/day for clozapine and chlorpromazine, respectively. The results showed that
      six clozapine-treated patients (28.6%) had more than 20% improvement in Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale score and were classified as responders, whereas none of
      the chlorpromazine-treated patients was classified as a responder. The degree of 
      improvement in positive symptoms, negative symptoms and Brief Psychiatric Rating 
      Scale scores in the clozapine group was inversely correlated with the severity of
      negative symptoms at entry into the trial. Two clozapine-treated patients were
      withdrawn from the study, one because of leukopenia and nausea, and the other
      because of vomiting and hypotension. Chlorpromazine treatment was prematurely
      discontinued in two patients, because of jaundice and over sedation in one, and
      because of severe weight loss in the other (9 kg). The rate of moderate-to-severe
      sialorrhea was high in clozapine-treated patients (28.6%). Two clozapine-treated 
      patients and two chlorpromazine-treated patients showed significant improvement
      in previously existing tardive dyskinesia and one chlorpromazine-treated patient 
      exhibited aggravation of tardive dyskinesia. The results of this study indicate
      that clozapine treatment might have advantages over chlorpromazine for Chinese
      schizophrenic patients who are refractory to typical neuroleptic treatment.

TI  - Extrapyramidal symptoms and tolerability of olanzapine versus haloperidol in the 
      acute treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 205-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: A relative lack of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS, i.e., the syndromes 
      of dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, dyskinesia) is one criterion used to
      determine whether an antipsychotic is "atypical." The extrapyramidal symptom
      profiles of the novel antipsychotic olanzapine and the conventional antipsychotic
      haloperidol were compared in a population of 2606 patients from three
      well-controlled prospective clinical trials. METHOD: Extrapyramidal symptom data 
      were analyzed for 1796 patients treated with olanzapine (5 to 20 mg/day) and 810 
      patients treated with haloperidol (5 to 20 mg/day) for up to 6 weeks of therapy. 
      Patients were monitored weekly by three methods of extrapyramidal symptom
      assessment: (1) detection of extrapyramidal adverse events (signs and symptoms)
      by casual observation, nonprobing inquiry, and spontaneous report; (2) objective 
      rating scale scores: and (3) use of concomitant anticholinergic medications.
      Emergence of EPS was assessed by (1) analysis of the incidence of extrapyramidal 
      syndrome categories based on adverse events, (2) the incidence of extrapyramidal 
      syndromes based on categorical analysis of rating scale scores, (3) analysis of
      mean maximum change in rating scale scores, and (4) categorical analysis of
      anticholinergic medication use. Outcome of EPS was assessed by (1) analysis of
      mean change in rating scale scores at endpoint and (2) mean anticholinergic use
      at endpoint. RESULTS: Olanzapine was statistically significantly (p = .014, p <
      .001) superior to haloperidol in all four analyses related to emergence of EPS
      and in the two analyses related to outcome. Furthermore, during acute treatment, 
      statistically significantly fewer patients treated with olanzapine (0.3%)
      discontinued the study because of any extrapyramidal adverse event than patients 
      treated with haloperidol (2.7%, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Olanzapine exhibited a
      statistically significantly lower extrapyramidal symptom profile than the
      conventional antipsychotic haloperidol at comparably effective antipsychotic
      doses. The lower extrapyramidal symptom profile with olanzapine was evident
      despite statistically significantly more frequent use of anticholinergic drugs
      among haloperidol-treated patients. Fewer olanzapine-treated than
      haloperidol-treated patients discontinued because of EPS, suggesting that
      olanzapine should contribute to better compliance with longer term maintenance
      treatment, with minimal anticholinergic-associated events.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol: acute phase results of the international
      double-blind olanzapine trial.
PG  - 125-37
AB  - A 6-week acute phase of an international 1-year double-blind study was conducted 
      comparing three dose ranges of olanzapine (5 +/- 2.5 mg/day, 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day,
      and 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day) with a fixed dose of olanzapine (1.0 mg/day) and with a
      dose range of haloperidol (15 +/- 5 mg/day) in the treatment of 431 patients with
      schizophrenia. The purpose was to determine whether olanzapine demonstrated a
      dose-related ability to decrease overall psychopathology with minimal associated 
      extrapyramidal symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The high-dose olanzapine 
      group showed statistically significantly greater improvement in overall
      psychopathology based on mean change in the CGI Severity score and statistically 
      significantly greater improvement in positive psychotic symptoms based on mean
      change in both the BPRS positive score and the PANSS positive score compared with
      the 1.0-mg/day olanzapine group. Analyses indicated that an increasing
      dose-response curve was observed across the range of all olanzapine dose groups. 
      Acute extrapyramidal syndromes were reported less frequently among all olanzapine
      groups compared with the haloperidol group. Endpoint mean change on both the
      Simpson-Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale reflected improvement for all 
      olanzapine treatment groups compared with worsening for the haloperidol group.
      Olanzapine was associated with weight gain but did not appear to have any
      clinically meaningful effect on vital signs. Although olanzapine was associated
      with some increase in prolactin concentrations, increases were transient,
      occurred less often, and were of lesser magnitude than those observed with
      haloperidol.

TI  - Risperidone: effects of formulations on oral bioavailability.
PG  - 599-605
AB  - The bioavailability of risperidone was evaluated in an open-label, randomized,
      two-way, crossover study comparing a 1-mg tablet with a 1-mg/ml oral solution.
      Both formulations were administered as a single 1-mg dose with a 10-day washout
      period between treatments. Of 26 healthy men who entered the study, 23 completed 
      both treatment periods. Plasma concentrations of risperidone and the active
      moiety (risperidone plus its active metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone) were
      determined by radioimmunoassays. For key pharmacokinetic values (Cmax, AUC), the 
      90% CIs on the relative bioequivalence of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and 
      the active moiety were contained within the equivalence range of 80-120% (80-125%
      for log-transformed data). The results demonstrate that the 1-mg/ml oral solution
      and the 1-mg tablet are bioequivalent.

TI  - New dimensions in the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia and related
      psychoses.
PG  - 363-78
AB  - During the past 5 years unprecedented advances have taken place in the
      psychopharmacology of schizophrenia and related psychoses. Clozapine and
      risperidone, two prototypic novel antipsychotic drugs, have had a significant
      impact on the treatment of psychotic disorders. Additionally, they have ushered
      in another generation of antipsychotic drugs with complex pharmacologic profiles,
      potentially enhanced efficacy, and more benign side-effect profiles than

TI  - Lack of allelic association between 102T/C polymorphism of serotonin receptor
      type 2A gene and schizophrenia in Chinese.
PG  - 35-8
AB  - Recent studies have reported an association between a 102T/C polymorphism of
      serotonin receptor type 2A gene (5-HT2A) and schizophrenia. In addition, an
      association was detected between a 102T/C polymorphism of the 5-HT2A receptor
      gene and drug response to clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenic patients.
      These studies suggest an important role of the 5-HT2A gene in schizophrenia. To
      study the possible involvement of the 5-HT2A gene in the pathogenesis of
      schizophrenia, a case-control association study was carried out in a Chinese
      population from Taiwan. No significant differences of genotype distributions,
      allele frequencies and homozygosity were detected between schizophrenic patients 
      (n = 177) and nonpsychiatric controls (n = 98). When subjects were divided into
      subgroups according to sex, still no differences of allele frequencies or
      genotype distributions were noted between patients and controls. Our data do not 
      support an allelic association between the 102T/C polymorphism of the 5-HT2A
      receptor gene and schizophrenia in Chinese population.

TI  - Benztropine versus clozapine for the treatment of tremor in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1077-81
AB  - Four open-label studies have reported beneficial effects of clozapine on the
      tremor of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). We performed a double-blind
      crossover trial with a 2-week washout, comparing low-dose clozapine to
      benztropine for the treatment of tremor in PD. Twenty-two subjects enrolled and
      19 completed the study. Benztropine and clozapine were equally effective in
      improving tremor and the motor score of the United Parkinson's Disease Rating
      Scale at mean doses of 3.0 and 39 mg/day, respectively. Significant adverse
      events were experienced with each drug, but leukopenia was not encountered. We
      conclude that the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine is helpful in the
      treatment of tremor in PD and should be considered when all other drug therapies 
      fail.

TI  - Negative symptoms: a path analytic approach to a double-blind, placebo- and
      haloperidol-controlled clinical trial with olanzapine.
PG  - 466-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated whether primary negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia are enduring or treatment-responsive. METHODS: Previously, a
      double-blind, random-assignment trial of the novel antipsychotic olanzapine (in
      low, medium, and high dose ranges), placebo, or haloperidol (10-20 mg/day) for
      335 schizophrenic inpatients was conducted for up to 52 weeks. Changes in the
      treatment groups from baseline to endpoint in summary scores on the Scale for the
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and several secondary measures were
      compared. This article describes a path analysis to determine to what extent the 
      total treatment effect on negative symptoms was direct or indirect (i.e.,
      mediated by differential effects on positive symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms,
      or mood). RESULTS: Significantly greater improvement was achieved with high-dose 
      olanzapine than with placebo or haloperidol. Olanzapine had a significantly
      greater direct effect than placebo on all SANS dimensions except
      anhedonia-asociality. Olanzapine also demonstrated a significantly greater direct
      effect than haloperidol on negative symptoms, especially on the dimensions of
      affective flattening and avolition-apathy. Olanzapine's superior effects were
      replicated in a subgroup with SANS-defined prominent negative symptoms (N = 116) 
      and a subgroup with a BPRS-defined cross-sectional proxy for the deficit state (N
      = 117). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia are directly responsive to treatment. The significantly greater
      direct and indirect effects of olanzapine than of haloperidol on negative
      symptoms are likely related to olanzapine's pleotrophic pharmacology, which
      includes dopaminergic, serotonergic, muscarinic, and adrenergic activities. The
      results contribute to the hypothesis that negative symptoms may be under the
      influence of several neurotransmitters within one or more neuroanatomic circuits.

TI  - Prediction of short-term changes in symptom severity by baseline plasma
      homovanillic acid levels in schizophrenic patients receiving clozapine.
PG  - 113-21
AB  - The relationship between pretreatment levels of plasma homovanillic acid (pHVA)
      and the outcome of clozapine treatment was studied in 18 male patients with
      schizophrenia who were resistant to treatment with conventional neuroleptics.
      After 6 months of clozapine treatment, 7 patients demonstrated > or = 20%
      decrease in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (responders), while 11
      patients did not (non-responders). Responders and non-responders did not differ
      with respect to the baseline pHVA level. The BPRS Positive Symptom scores at 6
      weeks and 3 months, but not those at baseline and 6 months, following initiation 
      of clozapine treatment negatively correlated with pHVA levels for all patients.
      The correlations became stronger when only responders were included. No
      significant correlation between Positive Symptom scores and pHVA levels was
      observed for non-responders. The BPRS Total and Negative Symptom scores did not
      correlate with pHVA for all patients, responders or non-responders at any time.
      The percent decrease in the BPRS Positive Symptom scores from baseline at 6 weeks
      following clozapine treatment correlated significantly with pHVA levels in
      responders. These results suggest that pretreatment levels of pHVA can be used to
      predict relatively short-term changes in the positive symptoms of patients with
      schizophrenia receiving clozapine treatment, particularly for clozapine
      responders.

TI  - Response to clozapine in acute mania is more rapid than that of chlorpromazine.
PG  - 109-12
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to compare the efficacy of clozapine with
      that of chlorpromazine in an open label manner (both given in association with
      lithium salts) in the treatment of acute mania. Thirty hospitalized manic
      patients were entered into the study. All patients met DSM-IV criteria for
      bipolar disorder, Manic Episode; 27 patients completed the study and three
      patients dropped for noncompliance. The duration of the study was 3 weeks.
      Patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups; group 1 (n = 15) was
      treated with clozapine at a mean dose of 166 mg/day and group 2 (n = 12) was
      treated with chlorpromazine at a mean dose of 310 mg/day. Manic symptomatology
      was rated on Young Rating Scale for Mania (YRSM) each week; side effects were
      recorded on dosage records and treatment emergent symptoms; extrapyramidal acute 
      side effects were rated on the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale performed at the
      beginning of the study and after 3 weeks of treatment. A two-way repeated
      measures analysis of variance on YRMS scores showed a significant time effect (p 
      < 0.0001) and a significant time-group interaction (p < 0.0001). Post-hoc
      comparison between the two groups showed a significant difference after 2 weeks
      of treatment (p = 0.0001), with clozapine treated patients showing lower YRSM
      scores than chlorpromazine treated patients. YRSM scores at the end of the study 
      were not significantly different. Patients treated with clozapine showed a more
      rapid trend toward amelioration. No clinically relevant side effect was observed 
      during the study.

TI  - Adverse effects of risperidone on eye movement activity: a comparison of
      risperidone and haloperidol in antipsychotic-naive schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 217-28
AB  - Risperidone is a novel and clinically effective atypical antipsychotic medication
      with a unique biochemical profile. To contrast the neurophysiological effects of 
      this new medication with those of a typical antipsychotic medication, we
      performed quantitative measurements of saccadic eye movements in a series of
      antipsychotic-naive schizophrenic patients treated with either risperidone or
      haloperidol. Patients were tested before and after 1 month of treatment, and a
      matched group of healthy subjects was tested twice over a similar time interval. 
      Risperidone, but not haloperidol, was associated with prolonged latency and
      decreased peak velocity and accuracy of saccadic eye movements that was
      detectable 4 weeks after treatment initiation. The adverse effects of risperidone
      may be due to the lack of development of acute tolerance to its powerful
      serotonergic (5-HT2A) antagonism, which could be responsible for the disruption
      of brainstem physiology in regions controlling saccadic eye movements.

TI  - Clozapine and associated diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 108-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine is an effective therapy for the treatment of refractory
      psychosis. Clozapine-associated adverse effects include sedation, weight gain,
      sialorrhea, palpitations, seizures, and hematologic changes such as
      agranulocytosis. METHOD: We present a four-case series in which clozapine use was
      associated with either a de novo onset or severe exacerbation of preexisting
      diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: The change in glycemic control was not significantly 
      related to weight gain. Three of the patients have been able to continue on
      clozapine therapy and have experienced a reduction in psychotic symptoms.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with a family history of diabetes mellitus or with
      preexisting diabetes mellitus may need to have blood sugar monitored closely
      during initiation of clozapine treatment.

TI  - In vivo effects on striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding by the novel atypical
      antipsychotic drug sertindole--a 123I IBZM single photon emission tomography
      (SPET) study.
PG  - 152-8
AB  - The novel antipsychotic drug sertindole has an atypical pharmacological profile. 
      We have estimated striatal D2 dopamine binding in schizophrenic patients treated 
      with sertindole using 123I iodobenzamide (IBZM) SPET. Patients were recruited
      from a clinical trial of sertindole's tolerability and efficacy. Striatal D2
      binding in sertindole-treated patients (n = 5), was compared with previously
      reported data from clozapine (n = 10); olanzapine (n = 6); typical antipsychotic 
      responsive (n = 10); and risperidone (n = 6)-treated groups. Mean PANSS
      (structured clinical interview for the positive and negative syndrome scale)
      scores showed clinical improvement in the sertindole group. Few extrapyramidal
      side effects (EPS) were recorded [average Simpson-Angus (SAS) score = 2.6].
      Sertindole-treated patients had mean D2 binding indices (+/-SE) significantly
      lower than clozapine-treated patients (1.19 +/- 0.04) versus (1.49 +/- 0.04), and
      olanzapine-treated patients (1.41 +/- 0.06); and similar to those of risperidone 
      (1.24 +/- 0.04) and typical antipsychotic responsive (1.25 +/- 0.05) treated
      patients. In this patient sample the preliminary evidence suggests that
      sertindole's decreased tendency to induce EPS at clinically therapeutic doses is 
      not due to limited occupancy of striatal D2 receptors in vivo, and as is the case
      for risperidone, patients are protected from EPS by some other intrinsic effect
      of the drug.

TI  - Blood levels of reduced haloperidol versus clinical efficacy and extrapyramidal
      side effects of haloperidol.
PG  - 299-311
AB  - 1. The studies of relationships between blood levels of reduced haloperidol HL
      (RH) and clinical efficacy in haloperidol (HL)-treated patients have yielded
      variable results. On the other hand, the contribution of RH upon HL's
      extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) had been suggested in animal models as well as 
      in preliminary clinical studies with limited subjects. 2. This study explored the
      relationships between blood drug levels and clinical effects and EPS of HL in 48 
      Chinese acutely exacerbated schizophrenic inpatients. After a single-blind
      placebo period of one week, the patients were treated with a fixed dose 10 mg of 
      HL for two weeks. Steady-state levels of HL and RH in plasma (n = 48) and in red 
      blood cells (RBC) (n = 37) were measured by high performance liquid
      chromatography. 3. The mean RH/HL ratio in RBC in the Chinese (0.55) is lower
      than that in non-Chinese patients as reported in the literature (> 2), so is the 
      RH/HL ratios in plasma. 4. No significant relationship emerged between percent
      improvement in BPRS total score and any of drug indices (HL, RH, sum of two
      compounds (HL+RH), and RH/HL ratio) in plasma and in RBC. Furthermore, the
      responders did not differ significantly from the nonresponders in each drug
      index. 5. Plasma RH levels were significantly higher in 30 patients experiencing 
      EPS compared with the other 18 patients (mean 2.14 +/- 1.71 (S.D.) ng/ml vs. 1.38
      +/- 0.37 ng/ml, p < 0.05). No significant differences in other drug indices were 
      noted between subjects with or without EPS.

PG  - 49-53
AB  - Preliminary results of a double-blind clozapine study in a population of chronic 
      psychotic patients at a state psychiatric facility are reported. Thirty
      "treatment-refractory" schizophrenic patients given a diagnosis according to
      DSM-III-R criteria (mean age of 44 +/- 9.1 years and a duration of illness of
      24.9 +/- 8.8 years) who received 300 mg or 600 mg of clozapine and randomized in 
      a double-blind fashion were analyzed. Subjects were evaluated using the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale on
      a weekly basis for 16 weeks. Based on the changes in their CGI scores at week 16 
      of clozapine treatment, subjects were retrospectively categorized as "improvers" 
      (N = 12) and "nonimprovers" (N = 18). The two groups were compared for changes in
      total BPRS and BPRS factor scores. In terms of total BPRS scores, we expected a
      difference between the two groups because they were categorized based on changes 
      in their CGI scores. However, the total BPRS scores in improvers showed a
      significant decrease by week 6 of clozapine treatment. On analyzing the four BPRS
      factors, the improvers showed improvement in the thinking disturbance factor by
      week 1 that remained steady from week 7. On the hostility-suspiciousness factor, 
      the improvers showed an improvement across time when compared with nonimprovers. 
      The withdrawal-retardation factor showed improvement in both groups across time, 
      whereas the anxiety-depression factor was least influenced by clozapine. These
      observations suggested that all BPRS symptom factors did not uniformly contribute
      to improvement in overall psychopathology, which was observed as a decrease in
      total BPRS scores.

TI  - Blood biogenic amines during clozapine treatment of early-onset schizophrenia.
PG  - 1077-89
AB  - The aims of this investigation were to evaluate long-term and short-term effects 
      of clozapine-treatment on plasma biogenic amines and psychopathology measures in 
      adolescents with schizophrenia (DSM-III-R criteria). The long-term study was
      conducted in a study sample of 40 young patients (age 14-22 years) following a
      mean of 3.4 years of neuroleptic treatment. During the study, 20 patients
      received clozapine, and the other 20 patients were treated with standard
      neuroleptic medications. At the beginning of the open clinical trials, the
      patients had already been receiving clozapine treatment for 24 +/- 15 months.
      Assessment of the biochemical and psychopathological measures was performed on
      six occasions at consecutive 6-week intervals during maintenance treatment with
      clozapine or conventional neuroleptics. Blood levels of serotonin,
      3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG), norepinephrine, and epinephrine were
      significantly higher in clozapine-treated patients than in conventionally treated
      patients. During long-term treatment, higher serotonin levels were associated
      with significantly fewer negative symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas higher MHPG 
      levels were correlated with less depression. The short-term effects of clozapine 
      were assessed in a second and independent study sample. After failing on
      conventional neuroleptics in clinical trials lasting a mean of 1.6 years, 15
      inpatients (aged 11-20 years) received clozapine. Weekly ratings of
      psychopathological symptoms using standard rating scales were performed in
      parallel to blood samplings for measurements of biogenic amines and serum levels 
      of clozapine. These measures were obtained for 6 weeks during conventional
      neuroleptic treatment and for 6 weeks during the open-label clozapine trial.
      Serum levels of serotonin and plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly
      higher during treatment with clozapine than during pretreatment with typical
      neuroleptics. A comparison of plasma epinephrine levels in responders (n = 7) and
      nonresponders (n = 8) to clozapine revealed that response to clozapine can be
      predicted by epinephrine levels prior to initiation of treatment with clozapine
      (responders ranging from 32.2 to 90.3 pg/ml; nonresponders ranging from 92.5 to
      473.5 pg/ml). Additionally, subjects who responded to clozapine showed increased 
      mean plasma concentrations of MHPG and epinephrine during treatment with this
      drug in comparison to the levels measured during pretreatment with typical
      neuroleptic medication. Nonresponders to clozapine failed to show this increase. 
      Finally, in responders to clozapine a negative linear relationship between
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia and the concentrations of plasma
      norepinephrine and serum serotonin were observed. In conclusion, our results
      demonstrate that plasma epinephrine levels prior to initiation of clozapine
      therapy predict response to this atypical neuroleptic. Our findings derived from 
      short-term and maintenance treatment with clozapine suggest involvement of
      norepinephrine, epinephrine and serotonin in the therapeutic actions of the
      atypical neuroleptic clozapine.

TI  - Assessment and treatment selection for "revolving door" inpatients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 377-92
AB  - GOALS: The goals of this study are 1) to determine causes and patterns of relapse
      for a cohort of "revolving door" schizophrenia inpatients, and 2) to assess the
      feasibility of starting a new psychopharmacologic intervention before discharge, 
      either depot therapy or an atypical antipsychotic. METHODS: Consecutive
      admissions to an acute inpatient unit in New York City were screened for
      "revolving door" criteria. Patients had to have a primary diagnosis of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and have either 1) two hospitalizations
      in the last year, or 2) three hospitalizations in the last three years. Patients 
      were then assessed for probable causes of relapse for the index and prior two
      hospitalizations. Treatment selection, based on this information, was
      trichotomized to: 1) oral conventional antipsychotic, 2) depot conventional
      antipsychotic (either haloperidol or fluphenazine decanoate), or 3) atypical
      antipsychotic (either risperidone or clozapine). RESULTS: Sixty-three out of 131 
      screened admissions met the above revolving door criteria. They were indeed
      "revolving", having an average of 1.3 hospitalizations per year over the last 3
      years and were only out of the hospital for five months (median) before index
      admission. The treatment selection process was hampered by lack of information
      about events leading to relapse, and by the lack of outpatient participation in
      the medication selection process. Of the 50 patients with complete histories
      about precipitants for the index episode, the most common reason for
      rehospitalization was judged to be medication noncompliance (n = 25; 50%),
      followed by medication nonresponse (n = 13; 26%). Not surprisingly, medication
      recommendations were closely linked to the assessed reason for relapse (depot
      therapy [n = 27; 49%] with medication noncompliance; atypical antipsychotic [n = 
      20; 37%] with medication nonresponse [X2 = 26.9, p < .001]). These two
      recommendations were implemented before discharge for about one-half of the
      cases. Patient refusal was a relatively greater problem for depot recommendation 
      while constraints in the outpatient environment were more problematic for
      patients recommended for atypical antipsychotics. CONCLUSIONS: Medication
      noncompliance and medication nonresponse, in that order, were judged to be the
      most common causes of relapse for "revolving door" inpatients. Both depot therapy
      and atypical antipsychotics were commonly recommended and ultimately accepted by 
      about 2/3rds of patients. Choice between depot and atypical was driven by the
      assessed cause of relapse. In summary, it seems possible to identify "revolving
      door" inpatients, and to target specific medication interventions within the time
      frame of an acute inpatient admission.

TI  - Dosing the antipsychotic medication olanzapine.
PG  - 45-9
AB  - Olanzapine is a new antipsychotic agent with serotonin/dopamine antagonism
      action. Efficacy in treating overall psychopathology in acute schizophrenia as
      measured by the BPRS0-6 total score was demonstrated at 10 mg/day versus placebo;
      at doses in a 5-20 mg/day range, olanzapine was comparable or superior to
      haloperidol. Superior efficacy for negative and depressive symptoms was shown in 
      comparison to haloperidol. Olanzapine has a favorable acute and tardive
      extrapyramidal symptom profile relative to haloperidol and caused substantially
      less elevation of serum prolactin. Dose-related weight gain and asymptomatic mild
      transaminase elevations occurred in olanzapine-treated patients.

TI  - Depression in the community: the first pan-European study DEPRES (Depression
      Research in European Society).
PG  - 19-29
AB  - DEPRESS (Depression Research in European Society) is the first large pan-European
      survey of depression in the community. A total of 13359 of the 78463 adults who
      participated in screening interviews across six countries were identified as
      suffering from depression, a 6-month prevalence of 17%. Major depression
      accounted for 6.9% of the cases of depression and minor depression for 1.8%.
      Depressed subjects in both these categories perceived that their working or
      social lives were substantially impaired by depressive symptoms. The remaining
      8.3% of depressed subjects considered that their functional impairment was not
      substantial. A significant proportion of sufferers from depression (43%) failed
      to seek treatment for their depressive symptoms. Of those who did seek help
      (57%), most consulted a primary care physician, the frequency of consultation
      increasing with the severity of depression. Sufferers from major depression
      imposed the greatest demand on healthcare resources, making almost three times as
      many visits to their GP or family doctor as non-sufferers (4.4 vs 1.5 visits over
      6 months). More than two-thirds of depressed subjects (69%) were not prescribed
      any treatment and when drug therapy was prescribed (31%), only 25% of these
      subjects were given antidepressant drugs. The number of days of work lost due to 
      illness increased with the severity of depression. Major depression had most
      impact on productive work, with sufferers losing four times as many working days 
      over 6 months as non-sufferers. The results of the DEPRES survey confirm the high
      prevalence of depression in the community and the burden imposed on the
      individual sufferer in terms of impaired quality of life and on society in terms 
      of healthcare utilization and lost productivity.

TI  - Substance abuse as a risk factor for tardive dyskinesia: a retrospective analysis
      of 1,027 patients.
PG  - 177-81
AB  - Tardive dyskinesia (TD) affects between 10 and 50 percent of all patients on
      long-term antipsychotic therapy, depending on the population studied. Various
      risk factors for TD have been reported; a correlation between TD and substance
      abuse has been suggested in some reports and not found in others. This study
      analyzes the association of substance abuse with the incidence of tardive
      dyskinesia in a schizophrenic population. All patients at the West Side Veterans 
      Affairs Medical Center are evaluated prior to the initiation of neuroleptic
      therapy with the Dyskinesia identification System: Condensed User Scale (DISCUS);
      those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or
      schizophreniform disorder during the years 1986 through 1993 were included in
      this analysis. History of substance abuse was considered positive if there was
      clinician report or diagnosis of substance abuse. These data were collected and
      analyzed using ANOVA. In a sample of 1,027 subjects (97% male), 83.2 percent had 
      a neuroleptic exposure of 10 or more years, and slightly more than half (50.8
      percent) had a positive history of substance abuse. Using research diagnostic
      criteria, 28.9 percent of the sample had tardive dyskinesia. Analysis of variance
      showed history of substance abuse (p < .000) and years on neuroleptics (p < .000)
      to be strongly correlated to a diagnosis of TD. Age was less strongly correlated 
      to the DISCUS score (p < .01), and there was no association of TD with diagnosis 
      (p = .237). This study therefore demonstrates a robust correlation between TD and
      substance abuse. A mechanism of action involving N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA)-mediated excitotoxicity is proposed.

TI  - An open clinical trial of risperidone monotherapy in young children with autistic
      disorder.
PG  - 155-9
AB  - Autistic disorder (AD) may be associated with dysfunctional behaviors which
      significantly interfere with a child's functioning. Risperidone has been
      described as having salutary effects as an adjunctive pharmacotherapy in adult
      and pediatric patients with AD. The purpose of this 8-week, open-label study was 
      to examine the effectiveness and tolerability of risperidone monotherapy in young
      patients with AD. Doses of risperidone were to be started at 0.25 mg qhs and were
      titrated to maximize clinical efficacy. Six patients (ages 5 to 9 years) were
      enrolled in this protocol, and all completed it. After 8 weeks of treatment, with
      a mean risperidone dose of 1.1 mg, improvement in symptomatology was demonstrated
      by reduced scores on both the Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (p < .005) and 
      the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (p < .001). The most common side effect
      were weight gain and sedation. This study provides preliminary evidence that
      risperidone monotherapy may be safe and effective in ameliorating dysfunctional
      behaviors in children with AD.

PG  - 65-71
AB  - This study evaluates the relative effectiveness and side-effects of risperidone
      as compared with conventional neuroleptics in the treatment of schizophrenia, by 
      meta-analysis of 11 double-blind, randomized controlled trials. The proportion of
      patients showing clinical improvement; use of medications for extrapyramidal
      side-effects (EPS); the treatment drop-out rates; and the changes in negative
      PANSS scores were measured. Compared with conventional neuroleptics, slightly
      more patients in the risperidone group showed clinical improvement [57 vs 52%;
      odds ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.56]. The use of
      concomitant medications for EPS was significantly less in the risperidone group
      than in the conventional neuroleptic group (22.8 vs 38.4%; odds ratio 0.51, 95%
      CI: 0.41, 0.63). The overall drop-out rate was lower in the risperidone group
      than in other neuroleptic group (29.1 vs 33.9%; odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61,
      0.94). The difference in changes in negative PANSS score between the risperidone 
      and the haloperidol group was -0.74 (95% CI: -1.50, 0.02). Weight gain and
      tachycardia are more common in patients treated with risperidone. Sensitivity
      analysis of different analytic approaches did not materially change the main
      estimates. It was concluded that the short-term efficacy of risperidone is
      comparable to other neuroleptics in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is
      associated with significantly fewer EPS than conventional neuroleptics (mainly
      haloperidol).

TI  - Measuring quality of life in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 32-47
AB  - Schizophrenia is a chronic disabling illness that affects about 1% of the
      population. It is a heterogenous disorder with variable aetiological, prognostic 
      and treatment response patterns. Its course is generally long term, with acute
      psychotic exacerbations that may require hospitalisation. The cornerstone of
      clinical management is the use of antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medications.
      Although these are effective, they can cause adverse effects that may impact
      negatively on the functional status of the individual. Early studies of quality
      of life in schizophrenia were mainly concerned with the development of techniques
      to identify patients' needs in the community. Difficulties encountered in these
      studies included: lack of agreement on definition of quality of life; lack of
      appropriate integrative conceptual models; concerns about reliability of
      patients' self-reports about their quality of life; and the lack of standardised 
      quality-of-life measures appropriate for schizophrenia. A number of
      disease-specific or generic scales have subsequently been used for measurement of
      quality of life in schizophrenia. The list of disease-specific scales is
      extensive; unfortunately, many of them were used only in a single study or their 
      psychometric properties were not specified. Generic scales can be applied across 
      various types and severity of illness, as well as in different health
      interventions across demographic and cultural groups. Medication costs in
      schizophrenia represent only a small fraction of the total cost of the illness.
      However, pharmacoeconomic studies have attracted much interest as a result of the
      high cost of newly introduced medications and of concern about the limitations of
      antipsychotic medications, particularly their adverse effects, as exemplified by 
      the reintroduction of clozapine for the treatment of refractory schizophrenia.
      Few studies have combined quality-of-life measures with cost analysis in
      schizophrenia; a number of these have methodological shortcomings. Many studies
      are retrospective in nature, and in most the number and length of
      hospitalisations has been used as the parameter for cost analysis, which can
      introduce bias depending on the varying approaches to hospitalisation. We
      conclude that the following factors are important in choosing or developing a
      quality-of-life measure for schizophrenia: quality of life is a multidimensional 
      concept that has to be reflected in its measurement; the scale has to be
      appropriate for the purpose as well as the population studied; measurement has to
      include patients' self-reports about their quality of life; measures should
      include only items that are relevant and expected to change; single-item global
      measures are useful only when combined with multidimensional measures; in
      developing new scales, psychometric properties have to be established as well as 
      being field-tested.

AB  - A prospective, open-label study in a 400-bed state psychiatric hospital evaluated
      change in therapeutic response among ten patients with treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia who were switched from clozapine to risperidone. Drug effects were 
      examined before discontinuation of clozapine and at three, six, nine, and 12
      weeks of risperidone treatment. No patients improved, and five discontinued
      treatment due to exacerbation of psychosis or adverse effects. Changes in scores 
      on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, 
      and the Barnes Akathisia Scale indicated clinically significant worsening of
      symptoms. The findings do not support replacing clozapine with risperidone for
      patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

PG  - 403-12
AB  - A modified neural network based on adaptive resonance theory (ART) was trained
      with the records of 211 psychiatric inpatients (74 schizophrenic, 50 unipolar
      depressed, 34 bipolar depressed, 20 bipolar manic, 33 other) who improved by at
      least 40 points on the GAFS during 8 weeks of treatment. Thereafter, a comparison
      was made between the clinical response of another 26 schizophrenic patients and
      28 unipolar depressed inpatients, to treatment suggested by the trained ART (N = 
      21) and by the consensus of two senior psychiatrists (N = 33). The patients were 
      allocated blindly and randomly to the two treatment groups. The BPRS (for the
      schizophrenic patients) or the HDRS (for the unipolar depressed patients) was
      completed weekly for 5 weeks. Results showed no difference between decisions
      regarding treatment by the ART network and by the experts. Length of hospital
      stay was also similar. All ART suggestions included supportive psychotherapy.
      High potency antipsychotics were suggested for 7 schizophrenic inpatients,
      clozapine for one and the addition of community therapy for another. Depressed
      patients got a variety of treatment suggestions. No contraindicated treatment was
      suggested by ART; however, two incomplete treatment suggestions were dropped from
      the study. In conclusion, in a prospective study ART was successful in learning
      treatment strategies and performed under supervision similar to experts.

TI  - Predictive value of eosinophilia for neutropenia during clozapine treatment.
PG  - 579-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myelotoxicity continues to hinder the widespread use of clozapine in 
      the United States. It has been theorized that eosinophilia predicts later
      agranulocytosis and that agranulocytosis occurs due to an immunologic mechanism. 
      Our study compares the rates of these dyscrasias in clozapine-treated patients
      and a control group. METHOD: Forty-one patients taking clozapine and 29 patients 
      taking haloperidol were monitored for a period of 6 months. Rates of eosinophilia
      and neutropenia were compared between the two treatment groups. RESULTS:
      Treatment-emergent eosinophilia occurred frequently in both haloperidol- and
      clozapine-treated patients. No significant difference was seen between groups in 
      the incidence of eosinophilia and neutropenia. CONCLUSION: We find no statistical
      difference between the rates of eosinophilia or neutropenia in haloperidol- and
      clozapine-treated patients. This study does not support the use of eosinophilia
      as a reliable predictor of neutropenia.

TI  - Adjunctive loxapine in a clozapine-resistant cohort of schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 193-7
AB  - The purpose of this trial was to assess the potential utility of adjunctive
      treatment with a typical neuroleptic for patients with refractory psychosis
      insufficiently responsive to clozapine alone. Seven chronic schizophrenic or
      schizoaffective patients who remained stabilized for at least 9 months on
      clozapine received open clinical trials with adjunctive loxapine lasting from 18 
      to 50 weeks. Their symptoms were documented with periodic Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale assessments. All patients improved at least somewhat and two
      improved remarkably. In the four cases in which the assessment was made, the
      loxapine had no apparent effect on plasma clozapine levels. We conclude that
      adjunctive treatment with typical neuroleptics for patients with an incomplete
      response to clozapine merits further investigation.

TI  - Childhood-onset schizophrenia. A double-blind clozapine-haloperidol comparison.
PG  - 1090-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood-onset schizophrenia is a rare but severe form of the
      disorder that is often treatment-refractory. In this study, the efficacy and
      adverse effects of clozapine and haloperidol were compared for children and
      adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia. METHODS: Twenty-one patients (mean
      [+/-SD] age, 14.0 +/- 2.3 years) with onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
      of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition-defined schizophrenia that began by
      age 12 years and who had been nonresponsive to typical neuroleptics participated 
      in the study. Patients were randomized to a 6-week double-blind parallel
      comparison of clozapine (mean [+/-SD] final dose, 176 +/- 149 mg/d), or
      haloperidol, (16 +/- 8 mg/d). RESULTS: Clozapine was superior to haloperidol on
      all measures of psychosis (P = .04-.002). Positive and negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia improved. However, neutropenia and seizures were major concerns. To
      date, one third of the group has discontinued using clozapine. CONCLUSIONS:
      Clozapine has striking superiority for positive and negative symptoms in
      treatment-refractory childhood-onset schizophrenia. However, due to possibly
      increased toxic effects in this pediatric population, close monitoring for
      adverse events is essential.

TI  - D-cycloserine added to clozapine for patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 1628-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of D-cycloserine added to clozapine were assessed and
      compared with previous results for D-cycloserine plus conventional neuroleptics. 
      METHOD: Ten schizophrenic outpatients receiving clozapine entered consecutive
      2-week trials of placebo and D-cycloserine at 5, 15, 50, and 250 mg/day. Clinical
      evaluations were videotaped and scored by a rater blind to the sequence of
      assessments. RESULTS: There was a significant dose effect of D-cycloserine on
      scores on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS); the 50-mg
      dose produced a mean 21% increase in SANS score. The patients had significantly
      higher baseline serum glutamate concentrations than the patients receiving
      typical neuroleptics in the previous trial. Baseline glutamate level and change
      in glycine level significantly correlated with response of negative symptoms to
      50-mg D-cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement of negative symptoms with
      D-cycloserine previously observed in patients receiving typical neuroleptics did 
      not occur in patients treated with clozapine.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the efficacy of fluoxetine augmentation of
      clozapine treatment response in schizophrenic outpatients who, despite adequate
      treatment with clozapine, continued to exhibit persistent positive or negative
      symptoms. METHOD: Thirty-three patients completed on 8-week, double-blind,
      parallel-groups comparison of adjunctive fluoxetine and placebo. RESULTS: There
      were no significant differences in positive, negative, depressive, or
      obsessive-compulsive symptoms between patients given adjunctive fluoxetine or
      placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that fluoxetine is not effective in
      augmenting clozapine treatment response.

TI  - Response of patients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia to clozapine within 
      three serum level ranges.
PG  - 1579-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the relationships between serum
      clozapine levels and therapeutic response. METHOD: Fifty-six inpatients who met
      the DSM-III-R criteria for chronic schizophrenia and who had not responded to
      extended treatment with classical antipsychotics were randomly assigned to 12
      weeks of double-blind treatment with clozapine at one of three serum level
      ranges: low (50-150 ng/ml), medium (200-300 ng/ml), or high (350-450 ng/ml).
      Baseline clinical assessments were completed before the patients' regular
      antipsychotic and anticholinergic drugs were discontinued. During clozapine
      treatment, serum levels were ascertained weekly to allow adjustment of clozapine 
      doses so as to maintain each patient near the midpoint of his or her assigned
      serum level range. Clinical assessments were completed after 6 and 12 weeks of
      treatment. RESULTS: The analyses of the results of treatment supported the
      superior efficacy of the 200-300 ng/ml and 350-450 ng/ml serum clozapine level
      ranges over the 50-150 ng/ml range, with no advantage for 350-450 ng/ml over
      200-300 ng/ml. Sleepiness increased with increasing serum levels. CONCLUSIONS:
      Serum clozapine levels per unit of daily dose were at the lower end of the range 
      noted in previous reports, possibly reflecting the current study's dosing
      schedules of twice or three times a day, the 11- to 13-hour postdose sampling
      time, and the moderate doses given. Serum clozapine levels, if interpreted in
      relation to daily clozapine dosing schedules, postdose sampling time, and total
      daily dose, may help to guide dosing to provide adequate opportunities for
      therapeutic response and to limit certain side effects of clozapine treatment.

TI  - Clozapine eligibility: the effect of stringent criteria on ethnic, gender and age
      subgroups of schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 1341-52
AB  - 1. The purpose of this retrospective chart review study was to determine whether 
      broad and stringent criteria differentially impact clozapine eligibility in
      ethnic, gender, and age subgroups of schizophrenic patients. 2. 505 patients
      charts were selected from a random cluster sample of mental health patients known
      to the city and county of San Francisco. Information related to clozapine
      eligibility was abstracted by trained non-clinical personnel. The impact of
      subgroup membership on eligibility was examined using logistic regression
      procedures. 3. Even under the broadest interpretation of FDA requirements for
      clozapine use, Asian patients were less likely to be eligible, since fewer Asian 
      patients met clozapine treatment requirements. Under more stringent eligibility
      criteria, older patients were more likely to be excluded from eligibility when TD
      does not automatically satisfy treatment criteria, and younger patients were more
      likely to lose eligibility if the number of required adequate medication trials
      increases to three. 4. Broad eligibility criteria tend to differentially exclude 
      Asian patients while more stringent criteria differentially exclude younger and
      older patients.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of glycine adjuvant therapy for
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
PG  - 610-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that schizophrenia is associated with
      underactivity of brain glutamatergic neurotransmission, especially at the level
      of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor. Glycine
      potentiates NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, indicating that it may
      serve as an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.
      METHOD: Eleven treatment-resistant patients with chronic schizophrenia completed 
      a double-blind, placebo-controlled, six-week, randomly assigned, crossover
      treatment trial of 0.8 g/kg body weight/day of glycine, added to their prior
      antipsychotic treatment. RESULTS: Glycine was well tolerated, resulted in
      significantly increased serum glycine levels and induced a mean 36 (7%) reduction
      in negative symptoms (P < 0.0001). Significant improvements were also induced in 
      depressive and cognitive symptoms. The greatest reduction in negative symptoms
      was registered in the patients who had the lowest baseline serum glycine levels. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results extend previous findings and suggest an additional
      approach to the pharmacotherapy of negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in
      schizophrenia.

AB  - Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic with affinity for a broad range of
      receptors, including serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptors. It is successful in
      treating about 60% of patients refractory to other antipsychotic drugs. Since
      genetic variation in clozapine's neurotransmitter receptor targets may affect
      clinical response through altering drug binding or receptor expression, we have
      studied a His452Tyr polymorphism in the 5-HT2A receptor (HTR2A) in a sample of
      153 schizophrenic patients undergoing clozapine treatment and 178 normal
      controls. An association was found between the allele Tyr452 and poor clinical
      response.

TI  - Clozapine response and the 5HT2C Cys23Ser polymorphism.
PG  - 2100-2
AB  - The presence of the 5HT2C receptor allele, Ser23, has recently been reported to
      predict favorable response to the antipsychotic drug, clozapine. This finding is 
      of interest as Ser23, compared with the more abundant Cys23, alters
      pharmacological characteristics of the receptor and therefore may provide
      insights into the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. We determined 5HT2C
      receptor genotype at the Cys23Ser locus in 66 subjects participating in
      double-blind studies of clozapine. There was no relationship between Ser23 and
      clozapine response (p = 0.30, Fisher's exact) nor was there any effect of Ser23
      upon absolute levels of psychiatric symptoms after 10 weeks of clozapine
      treatment (t = -0.57, p = 0.57). These data suggest that this 5HT2C receptor
      polymorphism is not associated with clozapine response.

TI  - Lack of association between polymorphisms in the 5-HT2A receptor gene and the
      antipsychotic response to clozapine.
PG  - 1092-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to determine whether either of two 5-HT2A
      receptor polymorphisms, 102-T/C and 452-His/Tyr, are associated with clozapine
      response. METHOD: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) ratings were obtained in 
      70 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to determine their
      response to clozapine compared with a typical neuroleptic. Patients were
      genotyped with the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length
      polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: Neither 102-T/C nor 452-His/Tyr was associated
      with clozapine response. There were no significant differences in BPRS scores
      among patients with different 5-HT2A genotypes at week 10 of clozapine
      administration. CONCLUSIONS: Allelic variation in the 5-HT2A gene is not
      associated with individual differences in clozapine response.

TI  - [Risperidone in the treatment of chronic schizophrenia: multicenter study
      comparative to haloperidol].
PG  - 165-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of five
      different doses of risperidone with a fixed dose of haloperidol in patients with 
      chronic schizophrenia. METHOD: After a 1-week single-blind, placebo washout
      phase, 99 chronic schizophrenic patients were randomly assigned to double-blind
      treatment with 1, 4, 8, 12 or 16 mg risperidone or 10 mg haloperidol daily for 8 
      weeks. Efficacy was assessed throughout the study by the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia, and Clinical Global Impression (CGI).
      Safety assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Ratinf Scale (ESRS) UKU
      Side Effect Rating Scale, vital signs, body weight, ECG and laboratory screening.
      RESULTS: Risperidone had a bell-shaped dose-response curve, with optimal
      therapeutic responses occurring at a daily dose of 8 mg. The therapeutic response
      to haloperidol was similar to that seen with risperidone 16 mg. Risperidone was
      associated with significantly less extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol, as
      assessed by the ESRS. The effect was mirrored by the requirement for
      antiparkinson rescue medication. Furthermore, the overall incidence of adverse
      events was markedly lower with the optimum dose of risperidone than with
      haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone is at least as effective as haloperidol for
      the treatment of chronic schizophrenia. Moreover, risperidone is associated with 
      an improved adverse event profile and significantly less extrapyramidal symptoms 
      which will have beneficial implications on patient quality of life and
      compliance. These results are in agreement with the results from the
      international multicenter trial.

TI  - Melperone in the treatment of iatrogenic psychosis in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 201-7
AB  - The pharmacological management of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be complicated by 
      psychiatric disorders induced by antiparkinsonian drugs. The reduction or
      withdrawal of levodopa (l-dopa) and other drugs commonly used in the treatment of
      PD may attenuate the psychosis but exacerbate motor impairment and disability.
      Melperone is an atypical antipsychotic drug showing in vivo a greater relative
      affinity for the 5-HT2 than the D2 receptors. A two-year study to assess the
      clinical efficacy and the safety of melperone in the management of iatrogenic
      psychosis in 30 parkinsonian patients was carried out. Neurological evaluation
      was performed with patients in the "off" and in the "on" state using the motor
      examination of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Time spent
      in "on" state was evaluated using the self-evaluation diary of daily life. To
      assess psychiatric disturbances the modified version of the Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale (BPRS) was used. The mean BPRS score was significantly reduced when 
      comparing baseline with individual examinations; no statistically significant
      differences were found between subsequent examinations. UPDRS motor score and
      time spent in "on" state during daily life showed no statistically significant
      differences when comparing baseline with subsequent examinations. Two patients
      dropped out because of excessive sedation problems but in the remaining 28
      patients melperone proved to be optimally tolerated.

TI  - Observation of metabolic changes in chronic schizophrenia after neuroleptic
      treatment by in vivo hydrogen magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
PG  - 345-52
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The authors investigate: (1) whether there is a lateral
      effect of hydrogen (1H) magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy observable
      metabolite ratios between the right and the left prefrontal lobe in chronic
      schizophrenia; (2) whether there is a change of proton metabolite ratios in
      chronic schizophrenia after neuroleptic treatment; (3) whether there is a
      relation between changes in 1H MR spectra and the clinical assessment of Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); and (4) to investigate a hypofrontality
      hypothesis in schizophrenia in terms of neurochemical aspects. METHODS: Localized
      in vivo 1H MR spectroscopy was used to measure the metabolite levels in the
      prefrontal lobes of control persons (n = 20) and of chronic patients before and
      after neuroleptic treatment (n = 34). The MR spectra of 8 cm3 voxels were
      compared with clinical assessment of BPRS in each subject. RESULTS: No
      significant metabolic lateral effect was established in both schizophrenia and
      control groups (P > 0.05). After neuroleptic treatment, chronic schizophrenic
      patients generally demonstrated a decrease of the complex of gamma-aminobutyric
      acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) containing (GABA + Glu)/creatine (Cr) ratio.
      CONCLUSIONS: The current follow-up 1H MR spectroscopy study shows a significant
      correlation between alterations of (GABA + Glu)/Cr ratio and BPRS, and supports a
      hypofrontality hypothesis in chronic schizophrenia. The reduction of (GABA +
      Glu)/Cr ratio after neuroleptic treatment may implicate the recovery of normal
      neuronal function in neurotransmitters. In vivo 1H MR spectroscopy may be a
      useful modality in follow-up evaluation of neuroleptic treatment in chronic
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Adverse effects of antipsychotic agents. Do newer agents offer advantages?
PG  - 895-930
AB  - Although antipsychotic drugs are effective in treating the so-called positive
      features of schizophrenia, between one-quarter and one-third of patients respond 
      poorly. Furthermore, the incidence of adverse effects is high, especially those
      reflecting disruption of extrapyramidal function, and is a major source of
      non-compliance. There is a clear need for new compounds that are more efficacious
      and/or better tolerated. Until recently, the classical dopamine hypothesis, with 
      its emphasis on D2 blockade as the key mechanism of antipsychotic action,
      dominated drug development, though the emphasis is now shifting. Three 'new'
      antipsychotics have reached the international market in the past 5 years-the
      newly rehabilitated clozapine and the genuinely new remoxipride and risperidone. 
      Claims of enhanced tolerability have been made for each of these, but as none is 
      free from adverse effects, their place in treatment can only be meaningfully
      established in relation to the efficacy of each in different clinical situations.
      Clozapine has an extensive profile of general, nonhaematological adverse effects 
      which is slightly different in emphasis from, but comparable in incidence to,
      that of chlorpromazine. There is a 0.8% risk of agranulocytosis in the first year
      of exposure, which can be fatal, though the boundary separating it from other
      (especially phenothiazine) antipsychotics in this regard is becoming increasingly
      blurred. It has a clearly diminished liability to cause extrapyramidal adverse
      effects. Its proven efficacy in operationally defined treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia and in patients intolerant to the extrapyramidal adverse effects of
      standard drugs establishes its credentials for advantage in these groups. There
      is on present evidence, however, only a hint of enhanced efficacy in acute
      schizophrenia: this requires further investigation. Open maintenance studies
      provide impressive data on long term outcome, especially in terms of
      quality-of-life parameters, but this issue requires to be addressed in blind,
      randomised trials. Until such additional information is forthcoming the risks and
      consequent costs would not justify extension of its use. The evidence to date is 
      that reported benefits in so-called negative features probably reflect its
      favourable neurological profile. While the advantages of clozapine are undoubted,
      they remain as yet restricted to selected patient groups. Remoxipride has a good 
      general tolerability profile, its special strength being its low sedative effect.
      However, its reported association with aplastic anaemia has severely restricted
      its use, and regular haematological monitoring is required. Although remoxipride 
      appears to have a lower liability to produce extrapyramidal adverse effects than 
      the high potency haloperidol, its benefits relative to other low potency
      compounds in this regard remain unproven. The only obvious situation in which its
      risks and consequent costs would be justified would seem to be patients with
      established compliance problems as a result of intrusive sedation with standard
      drugs. The position of other benzamides such as raclopride and amisulpride
      remains to be established. Risperidone, perhaps from its antiadrenergic actions, 
      has more in the way of cardiovascular adverse effects than haloperidol, though
      these can be obviated by graded early exposure. It may also be associated with
      greater weight gain. Otherwise it appears to be well tolerated. In comparison
      with haloperidol, it appears to be associated with a lower prevalence of acute
      extrapyramidal adverse effects in dosages < or = 10 mg/day, the most potentially 
      important component of which is its reportedly insignificant likelihood of
      promoting akathisia. These conclusions emerge from comparisons with haloperidol
      in doses many might consider somewhat high. The question of the advantage of
      risperidone over low or milligram-equivalent haloperidol regimens remains
      open.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

TI  - Smooth pursuit eye movements in the evaluation of famotidine adjunctive therapy
      of schizophrenia: a preliminary report.
PG  - 276-81
AB  - Smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are often abnormal in schizophrenic patients 
      and have been proposed as a trait marker of the disorder. We explored the use of 
      SPEM as an outcome measure in an open-label clinical trial of famotidine, an H-2 
      antagonist, in patients with schizophrenia; famotidine has been proposed as an
      adjunctive medication, particularly for negative symptoms. Prior studies using
      SPEM as an outcome measure have not found a significant effect with "typical"
      neuroleptic medication, and one study found greater SPEM dysfunction with
      clozapine treatment. In this study, 19 schizophrenic subjects were stabilized for
      at least 1 week on conventional neuroleptic medications and then administered
      oral famotidine, 100 mg daily, for an additional 3 weeks. SPEM and clinical
      measures were assessed. Whereas Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and
      Schedule for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) scores decreased
      significantly with famotidine administration, there was no significant change in 
      SPEM performance over the course of the study. Two subjects (11%) doubled their
      signal/noise ratio and maintained this increase after famotidine discontinuation,
      whereas three subjects (17%) approximately halved this ratio and returned to
      baseline after famotidine discontinuation. SPEM changes were not found to
      correlate significantly with changes in BPRS or SANS scores. These findings
      suggest that SPEM dysfunction reflects a "trait" rather than clinical "state" in 
      schizophrenia, and changes in SPEM performance might not be expected always to
      parallel changes in clinical ratings.

TI  - Allelic association between a Ser-9-Gly polymorphism in the dopamine D3 receptor 
      gene and schizophrenia.
PG  - 714-9
AB  - We examined a Ser-9-Gly polymorphism in the dopamine D3 receptor gene for allelic
      association with schizophrenia in 133 patients currently treated with clozapine
      and 109 controls. Allele 1 (Ser-9) was significantly more frequent in the
      patients (69%) than in the controls (56%) (P = 0.004). The 1-1 genotype was more 
      common (43% vs 30%) and the 2-2 genotype less common (5% vs 18%) in patients than
      in controls. When the patient group was subdivided on the basis of clinical
      response to clozapine, using a 20-point improvement in the global assessment
      scale as cut-off, genotype 1-1 was found to be more frequent among the
      non-responders (53% vs 36%, P = 0.04). To place our results in the context of
      previous studies of this polymorphism and schizophrenia, we performed a
      meta-analysis of all published data including the present sample. The combined
      analysis shows evidence for a modest association between genotype 1-1 and
      schizophrenia (odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.49, P = 0.01).
      These results suggest that the Ser-9 allele, or a nearby polymorphism in linkage 
      disequilibrium, results in a small increase in susceptibility to schizophrenia.

TI  - Idazoxan and response to typical neuroleptics in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. Comparison with the atypical neuroleptic, clozapine.
PG  - 571-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated whether antagonism of alpha 2 adrenergic receptors
      would augment treatment response in schizophrenia, by administering idazoxan, an 
      alpha 2 antagonist drug, to treatment-resistant patients on typical neuroleptics.
      METHOD: Seventeen hospitalised treatment-resistant patients with DSM-III-R
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were studied on typical neuroleptic
      treatment, on treatment with idazoxan plus typical neuroleptic, and after
      discontinuation of idazoxan, in fixed, non-random order, and under double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled conditions. RESULTS: The addition of idazoxan to fluphenazine 
      treatment resulted in significant reductions of global psychosis and total,
      positive and negative symptoms on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, compared to
      neuroleptic treatment alone. Symptom improvement significantly correlated with
      idazoxan-induced changes in indices of noradrenergic function. In a subgroup of
      patients, idazoxan plus typical neuroleptic treatment compared favourably with
      clozapine treatment, when both were compared to typical neuroleptic treatment
      alone. CONCLUSIONS: The antagonism of alpha 2 receptors augmented therapeutic
      response to typical neuroleptic treatment in treatment-resistant patients with
      schizophrenia. This antagonism may contribute to clozapine's superior
      antipsychotic effects.

TI  - Using the proportional odds model to assess the relationship between a multi-item
      and a global item efficacy scale in a psychiatric clinical trial.
PG  - 127-37
AB  - The proportional odds model is illustrated in the analysis of two efficacy scales
      used in a phase II clinical trial involving 81 schizophrenic patients. The
      proportional odds model preserves the discrete, ordinal nature of one of the
      scales. The analysis of this data suggested that the relationship between the two
      scales is not captured by a linear proportional odds model. A linear model and a 
      piecewise linear model for the explanatory variable were therefore compared using
      likelihood-based analyses. Residuals from both models were compared. Predicted
      probabilities for the ordinal categories were constructed from the estimated
      model. Extensions and limitations of the model for interpretation of other trials
      and for the planning of future trials are discussed.

PG  - 291-5
AB  - This open prospective study was undertaken to determine the efficacy and safety
      of a fixed dose (6 mg) of risperidone in psychotic patients. Hospital in-patients
      who fulfilled DSM-111-R criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar
      disorders were eligible for entry into the study (n = 15). Patients who were on
      other antipsychotics had a washout period of 1 week before they were started on
      the drug. A fixed dose of risperidone was administered (6 mg). The Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Negative Symptom Rating Scale (NSRS) and
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were used to measure psychopathology and
      extrapyramidal side-effects. Five patients dropped out of the study. Two patients
      became very agitated and potentially aggressive, one patient became very restless
      and did not respond to benzodiazepines, and one dropped out because of
      restlessness that did not respond to clonazepam. Of the 10 patients who completed
      the study, 50 per cent reduction on BPRS and NSRS was achieved by five and six
      patients respectively. There was a marginally significant trend towards a greater
      reduction in the magnitude of negative symptoms. Four patients required treatment
      with anticholinergic drugs. Risperidone was effective in resistent psychotic
      patients, but agitated and impulsive psychotic patients with positive symptoms
      may not be best candidates for treatment with risperidone. On average, negative
      symptoms respond better than positive symptoms.

      placebo-controlled trial in patients with schizophrenia. U.S. SEROQUEL Study
      Group.
PG  - 158-69
AB  - ICI 204,636 is a new, potentially atypical antipsychotic. In early phase II
      trials, the antipsychotic was well tolerated and results suggested efficacy in
      the treatment of the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The
      efficacy and safety of ICI 204,636 were evaluated on a larger scale in a 6-week, 
      multicenter, double-blind trial. Hospitalized patients who met DSM-III-R criteria
      for chronic or subchronic schizophrenia with acute exacerbation, as well as other
      criteria, were randomized to ICI 204,636 (75 to 750 mg daily) (N = 54) or placebo
      (N = 55). Patients were assessed weekly by use of the Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and Clinical 
      Global Impression Scale (CGI) for efficacy and the Simpson Scale and Abnormal
      Involuntary Movement Scale for extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Significant
      differences (p < or = 0.05) between treatment groups, which favored ICI 204,636, 
      were identified throughout the trial. Endpoint differences were significant (by
      analysis of covariance) for BPRS factor IV (activation) and SANS scores and were 
      marginally significant for total BPRS, BPRS factor III (thought disturbance),
      BPRS positive-symptom cluster, and CGI Severity of Illness item scores (p = 0.07,
      0.09, 0.06, and 0.09, respectively). ICI 204,636 was well tolerated, although it 
      was associated with mild transient increases in alanine aminotransferase and a
      higher incidence of somnolence and anticholinergic effects compared with placebo.
      In the dose range studied, treatment with ICI 204,636 did not induce EPS as
      determined by analysis of Simpson Scale total scores and lack of
      treatment-emergent acute dystonic reactions. Furthermore, ICI 204,636 did not
      produce sustained levels of prolactin; the mean change from baseline at endpoint 
      (-7.2 micrograms/L) was comparable (p = 0.44) to that for placebo (-8.2
      micrograms/L). These findings distinguish ICI 204,636 from standard
      antipsychotics and confirm preclinical predictions that ICI 204,636 is an
      atypical antipsychotic.

PG  - 519-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The timing and clinical correlates of symptom change following
      antipsychotic treatment were examined in first-episode and chronic schizophrenia.
      METHOD: The subjects were 36 first-episode schizophrenic patients who had
      received minimal or no neuroleptics and 34 patients with chronic illness whose
      neuroleptics had been withdrawn. They were followed for 2 years and assessed with
      the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms and the Scale for the
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Treatment decisions during follow-up were made
      clinically by the treating physicians. RESULTS: At 6-month follow-up, both the
      neuroleptic-naive and previously treated patients showed significant improvement 
      in positive symptoms (52% and 44% reductions from baseline, respectively). The
      previously treated but not the neuroleptic-naive patients also showed a
      significant reduction in negative symptoms (19% from baseline). A longer duration
      of illness before baseline assessment and inconsistent treatment during follow-up
      were independently associated with poorer treatment outcome in terms of positive 
      symptoms in both groups. There were no significant changes on the outcome
      measures in either group after the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The results
      suggest that maximum symptomatic improvement occurs within the first 6 months of 
      treatment and that disease progression may blunt treatment efficacy in both
      first-episode and chronic schizophrenia.

TI  - Does eosinophilia predict clozapine induced neutropenia?
PG  - 201-4
AB  - The atypical antipsychotic clozapine carries a high risk of inducing
      agranulocytosis. We attempted to investigate whether eosinophilia during
      clozapine treatment has predictive value for subsequent
      neutropenia/agranulocytosis. One hundred and seventy-seven patients were studied 
      in a prospective naturalistic design using haloperidol as the reference compound.
      Clozapine was found to differ from haloperidol in respect to their influence on
      neutrophil granulocytes. In the clozapine group patients with eosinophilia showed
      a decrease in neutrophil count (less than 2000/mm3 neutrophil granulocytes)
      significantly more often than patients without eosinophilia.

TI  - Relapse following clozapine withdrawal: effect of neuroleptic drugs and
      cyproheptadine.
PG  - 176-87
AB  - The objective of this study was to report the effect of the slow withdrawal of
      clozapine from 19 patients with neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia at the end
      of a 2-year clinical trial of clozapine and to compare this with the results of
      naturalistic discontinuation of clozapine treatment in 64 neuroleptic-resistant
      schizophrenic patients. Nineteen neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenic patients
      who received clozapine were withdrawn from clozapine by tapering it over 3-week
      period with and without the addition of a typical neuroleptic. Fifteen of the 19 
      neuroleptic-responsive patients experienced the return of psychotic symptoms
      during or after the clozapine taper, which were most severe in the ten patients
      in whom the withdrawal of clozapine was carried out without prior addition of
      neuroleptic treatment. Addition of a neuroleptic prior to clozapine withdrawal
      prevented the emergence of positive symptoms during clozapine withdrawal in each 
      of eight patients. Nevertheless, psychotic symptoms emerged, usually within a
      week after discontinuing clozapine, in six of the eight patients. Neuroleptic
      treatment, with or without an anticholingergic drug, was much less effective in
      treating positive symptoms in these patients immediately after the clozapine
      withdrawal than it had been 2 years previously. Cyproheptadine, a non-selective
      serotonin receptor antagonist, augmented the antipsychotic effect of neuroleptics
      in each of four patients who relapsed following withdrawal from clozapine and
      relieved extrapyramidal symptoms in a fifth patient. The frequency of relapse
      following withdrawal of clozapine in 64 neuroleptic-resistant patients was
      significantly lower (25/64, 39.1%) than in the neuroleptic-responsive patients.

TI  - Olanzapine versus placebo: results of a double-blind, fixed-dose olanzapine
      trial.
PG  - 159-67
AB  - Olanzapine is a potential new "atypical" antipsychotic agent. This double-blind, 
      acute phase study compared two doses of olanzapine [1 mg/day (Olz1.0); 10 mg/day 
      (Olz10.0)] with placebo in the treatment of 152 patients who met the DSM-III-R
      criteria for schizophrenia and had a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)-total 
      score (items scored 0-6) > or = 24. In overall symptomatology improvement
      [BPRS-total score and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)-total score], 
      Olz10.0 was statistically significantly superior to placebo. In positive symptom 
      improvement (PANSS-positive score, BPRS-positive score), Olz10.0 was
      statistically significantly superior to placebo. In negative symptom improvement 
      (PANSS-negative score), Olz10.0 was statistically superior to placebo. Olz 1.0
      was clinically comparable to placebo in all efficacy comparisons. The only
      adverse event to show an overall statistically significant incidence difference
      was anorexia (reported for 10% of placebo-treated and 0% of Olz10.0-treated
      patients). The Olz10.0-treated patients improved over baseline with respect to
      parkinsonian and akathisia symptoms, and these changes were comparable with those
      observed with placebo. There were no dystonias associated with Olz10.0 treatment.
      At endpoint, the incidence of patients with elevated prolactin values did not
      differ statistically significantly between placebo-treated and Olz10.0-treated
      patients. Olanzapine appears to be not only safe and effective, but a promising
      atypical antipsychotic candidate.

TI  - Dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in vivo by the novel atypical antipsychotic
      olanzapine--a 123I IBZM single photon emission tomography (SPET) study.
PG  - 148-53
AB  - We have studied striatal D2 dopamine binding in schizophrenic patients treated
      with the novel atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine. 123I iodobenzamide (IBZM)
      single photon emission tomography (SPET) was used to estimate striatal dopamine
      D2 receptor binding in vivo. Patients were recruited from a prospective, double
      blind controlled trial of olanzapine versus haloperidol treatment. In vivo
      striatal D2 binding data from olanzapine treated patients (n = 6) were compared
      with previously reported data from typical antipsychotic responsive (n = 10);
      clozapine (n = 10); and risperidone (n = 6) treated patient groups. Mean % Brief 
      Psychiatric Rating Scale score (BPRS) improvement following olanzapine treatment 
      was 49% (SD 44). The hypothesis that clinical improvement in olanzapine treated
      patients would be associated with higher mean striatal D2 binding of 123I IBZM
      (reflecting lower levels of D2 occupancy) than typical antipsychotic (1.25 +/-
      0.05) or risperidone (1.24 +/- 0.04) treatment was confirmed. Olanzapine treated 
      patients had similar levels of striatal D2 binding in vivo (1.41 +/- 0.06) as
      those treated with clozapine (1.49 +/- 0.04). This preliminary evidence suggests 
      olanzapine is another atypical antipsychotic drug in which therapeutic response
      is not associated with a high degree of striatal D2 receptor occupancy in vivo.

TI  - Mechanical lesions of the fimbria fornix in rat brain studied by 1H-magnetic
      resonance imaging. Evidence for long-lasting dynamic alterations in the
      ipsilateral ventricular system.
PG  - 21-7
AB  - In vivo 1H-NMR imaging was employed to study dynamic changes in the status of
      tissue water as a function of time after mechanical brain injury induced by
      partial unilateral transection of the fimbria fornix (FF) in the rat brain and
      was correlated with histology. Changes in the brain tissue were reproducibly
      found in distinct regions which were exclusively located in the lesioned
      hemisphere. The most pronounced changes concerned the lateral ventricle.
      Ventricular enlargement became evident posterior to the site of transection after
      a few hours and was maximal after 2-4 days. At later time points the posterior
      ventricular expansion was reduced. The lateral ventricle anterior to the site of 
      transection was significantly enlarged from day 1 and continued to expand for up 
      to 7 months. Tissue response at the site of transection, mainly involving the
      hippocampal formation and the thalamus, was first manifested after 24 h, while
      signs of progressive tissue degeneration were apparent in the long term.

TI  - A controlled trial with ORG 2766, an ACTH-(4-9) analog, in 50 relatively able
      children with autism.
PG  - 13-9
AB  - The aim of the present study was to replicate earlier findings of beneficial
      effects of ORG 2766, an ACTH-(4-9) analog, in autistic children. Fifty children
      with autism, 7-15 years old and with a Performance IQ of more than 60,
      participated in a double-blind placebo controlled parallel trial. Active
      treatment was 40 mg ORG 2766 for 6 weeks. The outcome was assessed on the basis
      of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist completed by parents and teachers, and by
      means of a detailed behavioral observation (30 subjects). ORG 2766 failed to
      improve social and communicative behavior at a group level. The rate of
      individual response, defined as a reliable change in social withdrawal at home
      and at school, to ORG 2766 (10 out of 30) and placebo (4 out of 20) was not
      significant either. The children who responded to ORG 2766, but not those who
      responded to placebo, manifested significant improvements outside the changes in 
      the defining variables, including a decrease in hyperactivity at school. The
      responders to ORG 2766 were characterized mainly by a relatively lower PIQ;
      further by more initial hyperactivity, stereotypies and abnormal speech, and less
      initial eye contact. The responders to placebo could not be differentiated from
      the non-responders to placebo. Future studies should examine whether ORG 2766
      differentially affects various subtypes of autism.

AB  - Twenty patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), who developed delusions and
      psychotic behavior, underwent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings before and
      during treatment with low-dose clozapine. Resolution of the psychotic features
      was observed in all cases. The EEG was unaltered in 15, whereas five patients
      exhibited increased generalized or focal slowing when compared with the
      pretreatment tracings. These findings contrast with the high incidence of EEG
      abnormalities, including epileptiform activity, which are observed when larger
      doses of clozapine are used in schizophrenic patients, but they underscore that
      even in low doses, clozapine may cause EEG changes.

TI  - Antipsychotic and anxiolytic properties of risperidone, haloperidol, and
      methotrimeprazine in schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 38-44
AB  - The subjects were 62 patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of
      schizophrenia and were randomly assigned to receive risperidone (mean dose, 7.4
      mg/day), haloperidol (7.6 mg/day), or methotrimeprazine (100 mg/day) for 4 weeks.
      Clinical improvement, defined a priori as a 20% reduction in total Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores at end point, was attained by 81% of the
      risperidone patients, 60% of the haloperidol patients, and 52% of the
      methotrimeprazine patients (p < 0.05). The reductions in total PANSS and Clinical
      Global Impression Scale severity scores from baseline to end point were
      significantly greater in the risperidone patients than in the other two groups.
      Reductions in scores on the Psychotic Anxiety Scale were significantly greater in
      the risperidone patients than the methotrimeprazine patients; the difference
      between haloperidol and methotrimeprazine was not significant. Extrapyramidal
      symptoms (scores on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale) were more severe in 
      the haloperidol patients than in the other two groups, but few differences were
      apparent between risperidone and methotrimeprazine patients. It is concluded that
      risperidone is an effective antipsychotic and anxiolytic agent in schizophrenic
      patients.

PG  - 699-703
AB  - As part of a prospective efficacy and safety monitoring system, patients
      receiving clozapine are assessed monthly for dyskinetic events (DE), using the
      Abnormal involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Longitudinal analysis of 45 patients 
      revealed 20 with baseline DE, 7 who developed emergent DE after a negative
      baseline assessment, and 18 patients with no DE symptoms throughout treatment
      with clozapine. Eight of the 20 patients with baseline DE were assessed to
      resolution of symptoms, with an average time of 261 +/- 188 days; 5 were
      evaluated until complete resolution of symptoms (AIMS = 0), with an average time 
      of 691 +/- 462 days. The average time to onset of DE in emergent DE patients was 
      238 +/- 179 days, and the average time to resolution was 347 +/- 179 days after
      diagnosis. Four patients attained complete resolution with an average time of 629
      +/- 293 days after diagnosis. It appears this emergent type of dyskinesia is
      different from other currently described dyskinesias. Overall, of the 27 patients
      having DE at any point in treatment, 15 of 27 (56%) had resolution of symptoms
      and 10 of 27 (37%) had complete resolution of DE. Clinicians should be aware of
      the utility of clozapine in dyskinesia and the extended time frame of response.

TI  - Clozapine's effectiveness for patients in state hospitals: results from a
      randomized trial.
PG  - 683-97
AB  - In our study, we examined the effectiveness of clozapine and compared it to the
      array of medication alternatives typically used in the public sector. Long-term
      patients in Connecticut's state hospitals who met Food and Drug Administration
      criteria for clozapine use were invited to participate in this randomized
      open-label study. Participants (N = 227) were followed for 2 years. Compared with
      usual care, clozapine was associated with significantly greater reductions in
      side effects, disruptiveness, and hospitalization, but was not more effective in 
      reducing symptoms or improving quality of life. The groups did not differ in
      likelihood of being discharged; however, once discharged, clozapine patients were
      less likely to be readmitted. The results of our study suggest that, compared
      with the flexible range of medication alternatives available, clozapine is an
      effective agent. However, at least with this patient population, clozapine did
      not produce the dramatic improvements is symptomatology or hospital utilization
      reported in clinical efficacy trials or suggested by mirror-image studies.

TI  - Therapeutic effect and safety of adjunctive risperidone in refractory
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
PG  - 677-82
AB  - It has been well established that more than 40 percent of patients with
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not improve after an adequate trial with
      serotonin uptake inhibitors (SUIs). The first purpose of this trial was to
      compare the short-term efficacy and safety of two different strategies in a
      sample of treatment-refractory OCD patients: dose increase of the ongoing
      treatment versus the addition of another SUI. The second purpose was to
      investigate the short-term efficacy and safety of adjunctive risperidone in
      SUI-refractory OCD patients. Thirty-three OCD patients who were unimproved after 
      a short-term treatment with clomipramine (150 mg/day) were admitted to the study.
      In the first part of the study, the dose increase of clomipramine was compared
      with sertraline addition, in an open-label manner. The addition of sertraline to 
      the ongoing treatment appeared to be more effective and tolerable than the
      clomipramine dose increase. Seven (50%) of the 14 patients who were considered
      nonresponders after the first part of the study, showed good clinical improvement
      and good tolerability after risperidone augmentation. These results suggest that 
      risperidone addition to ongoing SUIs may be useful in augmenting pharmacologic
      response in OCD.

TI  - Polypharmacy in bipolar I disorder.
PG  - 579-87
AB  - There are currently three mood stabilizers available for the maintenance
      treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder: lithium, valproate, and
      carbamazepine. Unfortunately, monotherapy with each of these conventional agents 
      often fails. To improve outcome, clinicians utilize polypharmacy. Although the
      efficacy of this practice is largely unknown, because of the lack of controlled
      studies, data from the United States and Europe indicate polypharmacy is the rule
      rather than the exception. The few controlled trials that have been conducted
      indicate that (1) the specific combination of lithium plus imipramine provides no
      advantage over lithium monotherapy (notwithstanding the inadequacy of lithium
      monotherapy); (2) the specific combination of lithium and the depot neuroleptic
      flupenthixol provides no advantage over lithium monotherapy; and (3) the
      combination of lithium plus carbamazepine may be as effective as lithium plus
      haloperidol for acute and continuation treatment. Most of the literature on
      polypharmacy consists of case reports, retrospective chart reviews, and
      open-label prospective studies, and describes the use of numerous combinations of
      medications, including lithium plus valproate, lithium plus carbamazepine, and
      valproate plus carbamazepine. Preliminary findings suggest these combinations may
      be effective, and that clozapine and high-dose levothyroxine may each be useful
      as well when combined with other drugs. Further research is necessary to formally
      evaluate whether these drug combinations are more effective than monotherapy.
      Until such studies are completed, certain general principles regarding side
      effects, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics should be kept in mind when
      prescribing two or more medications concurrently.

TI  - Cholinergic rebound and rapid onset psychosis following abrupt clozapine
      withdrawal.
PG  - 591-5
AB  - Following the conduct of a 28-day inpatient bioequivalence study of clozapine in 
      schizophrenia patients, withdrawal effects after abrupt discontinuation from
      clozapine were assessed. Thirty patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for
      schizophrenia, residual type, or schizophrenia in remission were enrolled in the 
      study. Patients were evaluated for symptoms of withdrawal effects for 7 days
      after clozapine 200 mg/day was abruptly withdrawn. Of 28 patients who completed
      the study, 11 had no withdrawal symptoms; 12 had mild withdrawal adverse events
      of agitation, headache, or nausea; four patients experienced moderate withdrawal 
      adverse events of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; and one patient experienced a
      rapid-onset psychotic episode requiring hospitalization. Cholinergic rebound is a
      likely explanation for the mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms and is easily
      treated with an anticholinergic agent. Mesolimbic supersensitivity, as well as
      specific properties of clozapine, are discussed as likely causes for rapidonset
      psychosis. Our findings are consistent with previous reports of withdrawal
      reactions associated with clozapine, further reminding clinicians to monitor
      patients closely following abrupt discontinuation of clozapine.

TI  - Obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia: a comparison of olanzapine and
      placebo.
PG  - 89-93
AB  - The antipsychotic drug olanzapine is similar to clozapine and risperidone in
      potent serotonergic antagonism. We assessed obsessive-compulsive symptoms during 
      olanzapine treatment because these symptoms have been reported during risperidone
      and clozapine treatment. Obsessions and compulsions were measured in 25 subjects 
      with schizophrenia before and after a 6-week double-blind trial comparing two
      olanzapine doses to placebo. At baseline, 8 subjects had mild or moderate
      obsessions, and 6 had mild compulsions. There was no significant difference in
      the course of obsessive-compulsive symptoms among the three treatment groups. We 
      found that olanzapine did not appear to cause obsessive-compulsive symptoms in
      patients with schizophrenia. Our sample size, the dose and duration of olanzapine
      treatment, and assessment methods limit the extent to which this finding can be
      generalized. Though emerging obsessive-compulsive symptoms have been reported for
      13 clozapine-treated and 2 risperidone-treated patients with schizophrenia, this 
      phenomenon has not yet been demonstrated in a controlled study.

TI  - A comparison of an atypical and typical antipsychotic, zotepine versus
      haloperidol in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia: a
      parallel-group double-blind trial.
PG  - 81-7
AB  - The atypical antipsychotic zotepine was compared to haloperidol in 126 patients
      suffering from acute exacerbation of schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) in a randomized,
      double-blind study. After 8-weeks, 150 to 300 mg zotepine improved scores on the 
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) more than 10 to 20 mg haloperidol (-17.03
      versus -13.45; 95%CI for zotepine-haloperidol -9.34/2.04). BPRS subscores and
      Clinical Global impressions (CGI) Severity and improvement subscales showed
      comparable gains, but scores on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms
      (SANS) improved significantly more with zotepine (-23.82) than haloperidol
      (-15.15; P < .05; 95%CI for zotepine haloperidol -18.03/-0.18). Adverse events
      were reported by 71 percent of zotepine and 78 percent of haloperidol patients.
      Extrapyramidal side effect (EPMS) scores decreased with zotepine (-0.34) but
      increased with haloperidol (+2.32; P < .05). Seven haloperidol patients reported 
      akathisia but no zotepine patients did (p < .05). Uric acid reductions (which
      appear to have no clinical consequence) and transient raised liver enzymes were
      recorded with zotepine. Weight increased on zotepine (2.32 kg; P < .001) and a
      small increase in pulse rate occurred (P < .05). Both drugs were effective in
      reducing positive symptoms of schizophrenia; zotepine was significantly more
      effective against negative symptoms and reduced EPMS.

TI  - Plasma prolactin in schizophrenia subjects treated with Seroquel (ICI 204,636).
PG  - 107-10
AB  - Treatment with standard antipsychotic medications causes side effects such as
      hyperprolactinemia and extrapyramidal symptoms. Because these side effects can
      cause noncompliance with antipsychotic medication and consequent relapse, they
      add to the morbidity of schizophrenia. A compound with antipsychotic efficacy but
      without the side effects of standard antipsychotic agents would improve
      compliance and treatment outcomes and enhance quality of life. Improved
      compliance, reduced relapse, and decreased hospitalization would also reduce the 
      cost of treatment of schizophrenia. Seroquel (ICI 204,636), an atypical
      antipsychotic compound in Phase III development, was found to be well tolerated
      and effective in treating subjects with DSM-III-R schizophrenia in three Phase II
      clinical trials. Analysis of plasma prolactin concentrations obtained during
      these trials revealed that ICI 204,636 did not differ from placebo in its effect 
      on plasma prolactin after up to 6 weeks of treatment; no significant difference
      was found in the degree of decline of plasma prolactin levels when subjects
      treated with ICI 204,636 and placebo were compared. A significant difference was 
      found, however, between ICI 204,636- and chlorpromazine-treated subjects;
      prolactin levels in ICI 204,636-treated subjects fell to a greater degree than
      they did in chlorpromazine-treated subjects, however in all three trials, ICI
      204,636 did not cause sustained elevation of prolactin.

TI  - Serotonin-mediated increase in cytosolic [Ca++] in platelets of
      risperidone-treated schizophrenia patients.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - Stimulating the platelet 5HT2 receptor generates the second messenger IP3, and
      results in an increase in cytosolic [Ca++] ([Ca++]cyt). Platelets from
      risperidone-treated patients would be expected to respond less effectively, as
      measured by decreased [Ca++]cyt, after 5HT2 receptor stimulation. We report the
      data on 6 risperidone-treated patients and 6 normal controls evaluated at our
      site using the Fura-2 method for determining platelet [Ca++]. Data analysis was
      performed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. No significant differences
      between groups were found for ED50 5HT-stimulated [Ca++]cyt (ED50 5HT delta
      [Ca++]cyt). Significant differences were found for maximal change [Ca++]cyt (Max 
      delta [Ca+2]cyt) between risperidone-treated patients and normal controls (p =
      .03). These preliminary data suggest that measurement of 5HT-stimulated changes
      in platelet cytosolic [Ca+2] might be a useful marker for in vivo risperidone
      inhibition of 5HT2 function.

      advantages over conventional antipsychotics for treating both positive and
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia. A number of clinical reports indicate that
      risperidone is also effective for psychotic illnesses that result from other
      disorders. Risperidone has a relatively mild side effect profile when compared
      with conventional antipsychotics.

AB  - Despite the proven efficacy of antipsychotic medication in the treatment of
      schizophrenia, a substantial proportion of patients derive little if any benefit 
      from traditional medications. Though alternative strategies (e.g., increasing
      dosage, switching antipsychotic, or adding adjunctive medication) are frequently 
      employed, success rates are often disappointing. Clozapine has shown to be
      effective in some poor or partially responsive patients in three prospective,
      random assignment, double-blind trials. Risperidone has not yet been extensively 
      studied in treatment-resistant patients, but may also be a useful alternative.

TI  - The Nisonger CBRF: a child behavior rating form for children with developmental
      disabilities.
PG  - 41-57
AB  - Although the rate of behavior and emotional problems of children with mental
      retardation is considerably higher than the rate among typically developing
      children, there is a shortage of tools for assessing persons with mental
      retardation. The Child Behavior Rating Form (CBRF) was modified by altering
      instructions and adding new items describing behavior problems known to occur in 
      children with mental retardation. The adapted scale was named the Nisonger CBRF. 
      Three hundred sixty-nine children being assessed at a University Affiliated
      Program for MR/DD were rated on the CBRF by their parents and teachers.
      Independent factor analyses of parent and teacher ratings produced two Social
      Competence subscales and six Problem Behavior subscales. These results were
      largely consistent across rater types and similar to prior findings with the
      CBRF. Internal consistency was generally high, parent-teacher agreement was
      satisfactory, and subscales from the Nisonger CBRF correlated highly with
      analogous subscales from the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The Nisonger CBRF
      appears to be a promising new tool for assessing behavioral and emotional
      problems in children with mental retardation; however, further psychometric work 
      is warranted.

TI  - Clozapine eligibility among state hospital patients.
PG  - 15-25
AB  - Connecticut State Hospital's entire resident population (n = 1,300) was screened 
      on an arbitrary target day to determine eligibility for clozapine. Sixty percent 
      of 803 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder diagnoses met Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved criteria for clozapine use as judged by
      review of past medication trial records and by the responsible physicians.
      Eighty-eight percent of these patients were medically cleared, and of those
      cleared, 63 percent agreed to clozapine treatment. Of the patients who began a
      clozapine trial, 76 percent were still taking the drug 12 months later.
      Preliminary findings from a randomized trial of clozapine versus usual care (n = 
      227) indicate that discharge rates associated with clozapine and usual care do
      not differ. Once discharged, however, patients assigned to clozapine are less
      likely to be readmitted. Hence, clozapine may be more cost-effective than usual
      care. However, before savings can be realized, State governments will have to
      make up-front investments of approximately $140 million simply to give patients
      hospitalized on a single day a year's access to clozapine.

PG  - 65-74
AB  - After noting a striking difference in the dosing practices of two treating
      psychiatrists, each responsible for the operation of a clozapine unit in a state 
      psychiatric hospital, the authors conducted a retrospective chart review to
      assess the clinical efficacy of low dose x = 294 mg. per day) versus high dose (x
      = 525 mg. per day) clozapine treatment for a cohort of 31 inpatients. Levels of
      psychopathology, behavior, and social functioning were assessed six months pre
      and during clozapine treatment for 16 patients who received low dose clozapine
      treatment and 15 patients who received high dose clozapine treatment. Patients on
      both units demonstrated significant reductions in their levels of
      psychopathology, improved social functioning and improvement in their behavior
      following six months clozapine treatment. This naturalistic study suggests that
      the use of low dose clozapine provides effective treatment for chronic, severely 
      treatment resistant inpatients with schizophrenia or schizo-affective illness, at
      the same time reducing the potential for significant side effects.

PG  - 169-72
AB  - A cysteine to serine substitution at amino acid 23 in the 5-HT2C receptor gene
      alters the pharmacological properties of the protein. We investigated this
      polymorphism in subjects with schizophrenia resistant to conventional neuroleptic
      drugs, and analysed our data for allelic association between the disease state or
      clinical response to the atypical antipsychotic drug, clozapine. Ninety percent
      of subjects who had one or more 5-HT2Cser alleles (19/21) were classified as
      clozapine responders compared with 59% (84/141) without this allele (chi 2 = 7.7,
      p = 0.005), suggesting that this mutation is a predictor of good response to
      clozapine. There was no association between schizophrenia and the 5-HT2Cser
      allele, but our results indicate that the 5-HT2C receptor may contain the major
      site of action through which clozapine mediates its antipsychotic effects.

TI  - Risperidone in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 207-13
AB  - Risperidone has antiserotonergic and antidopaminergic properties that may make it
      more effective than conventional antipsychotic agents in the treatment of the
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Clinical trials in chronic schizophrenic
      patients have shown trends in favor of risperidone in the control of negative
      symptoms compared with haloperidol, perphenazine or zuclopenthixol, but the
      differences were not consistently statistically significant. A meta-analysis of
      the pooled results from six double-blind trials showed that risperidone at doses 
      ranging from 4 to 8 mg/day had a significantly (p < 0.004) higher negative
      symptom response rate, defined as the percentage of patients with a 20% or more
      reduction in scores on the negative subscale of the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale, than patients receiving active controls. The combined patient
      population treated with 4-8 mg/day of risperidone was 1.43 times more likely to
      have had a clinical response on the negative symptom subscale than the combined
      population treated with haloperidol, perphenazine or zuclopenthixol.

TI  - Efficacy of risperidone treatment for psychoses associated with schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or senile dementia in 11 geriatric
      patients: a case series.
PG  - 514-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials of risperidone, a recently approved novel
      antipsychotic, included elderly healthy patients, but more data are needed on the
      effects of risperidone in this population, especially those with comorbid medical
      illnesses. METHOD: Risperidone was used to treat 11 elderly hospitalized patients
      between 61 and 79 years of age who manifested signs of psychoses related to
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or senile dementia.
      All patients had been treated previously with classic antipsychotics. Response
      was assessed by clinical observation of the patients' behavior. RESULTS: Eight
      patients responded to treatment, 1 did not respond, and 2 had treatment
      discontinued because of hypotension or dizziness. Positive and negative symptoms 
      decreased markedly in 7 of the responding patients. Four patients had preexisting
      extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia that also
      decreased in response to risperidone treatment. In addition, 4 patients were able
      to discontinue anti-parkinsonian medications, and 2 were able to discontinue
      antihypertensive medications. Side effects related to blockade of dopamine,
      histamine, and serotonin were negligible. No adverse consequences occurred when
      electroconvulsive therapy, carbamazepine, or lithium was given concurrently.
      CONCLUSION: The reduction of both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia
      and the lack of significant EPS, tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and
      anticholinergic side effects indicate that risperidone is a safe and effective
      medication for the elderly.

TI  - Free radical scavenging enzyme activity and related trace metals in
      clozapine-induced agranulocytosis: a pilot study.
PG  - 353-60
AB  - We hypothesized that patients who had experienced clozapine-induced
      agranulocytosis would have abnormalities in their free radical scavenging enzyme 
      activity (FRESA) and levels of related trace metals. We therefore measured FRESA 
      profiles and related trace metals in four groups: post-clozapine agranulocytosis 
      (POST CLOZ AGRAN) (N = 9); clozapine no agranulocytosis (CLOZ NO AGRAN) (N = 12);
      West Coast controls (WC CONTROLS) (N = 14); and Long Island Jewish Medical Center
      controls (LIJ CONTROLS) (N = 12). Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px, P1) levels in
      plasma were slowest in the POST CLOZ AGRAN group (34.3 +/- 6.9 IU/dl [standard
      deviation; SD]; p < 0.002); red blood cell glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px, RBC)
      was highest in the WC CONTROLS (38.7 +/- 4.7 IU/g hemoglobin [Hgb]; p < 0.008);
      and selenium (SE) levels in plasma were lower in both the POST CLOZ AGRAN group
      (111.6 +/- 14.7 ng/ml) and the CLOZ NO AGRAN group(115.0 +/- 17.8) than in the WC
      CONTROLS (142.5 +/- 18.3; p < 0.0006). SE was also lower in the POST CLOZ AGRAN
      group than in the LIJ CONTROLS (129.1 +/- 21.6; p < 0.04). The presence of at
      least one of the following: (1) GSH-Px, P1 < 37.6 IU/dl; (2) GSH-Px, RBC < 31.0
      IU/g Hgb; or (3) SE < 112.4 ng/ml, distinguished POST CLOZ AGRAN subjects from
      the WC CONTROLS, but not from the LIJ CONTROLS. Data from this cross-sectional
      pilot study suggest that abnormalities in the body's antioxidant defense system
      may be involved in the pathogenesis of clozapine-associated agranulocytosis. If
      confirmed in large-scale, prospective studies, these preliminary findings have
      potential clinical application in the screening and prophylaxis of clozapine
      agranulocytosis.

TI  - Clozapine in severe mood disorders.
PG  - 411-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing literature suggests that the atypical antipsychotic agent
      clozapine may be effective in schizoaffective and psychotic mood disorders.
      METHOD: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of clozapine in severe mood
      disorders, we reviewed published studies on clozapine in schizophrenia, bipolar
      disorder, schizoaffective disorder, major depression, and organic disorders with 
      psychotic or major affective syndromes, identified through the MEDLINE data base.
      RESULTS: Patients in manic or psychotic phases of schizoaffective or bipolar
      disorder were significantly more likely to respond to clozapine than patients
      with schizophrenia (p = .006) or severe depressive syndromes (unipolar, bipolar, 
      and schizoaffective depression combined; p = .001). There was no significant
      difference in the side effect profile secondary to clozapine in patients with
      severe mood disorders compared to patients with schizophrenia. CONCLUSION:
      Clozapine appears to be effective and well-tolerated in the short-term and
      maintenance treatment of severe or psychotic mood disorders, particularly in the 
      manic-excited phases of schizoaffective and bipolar disorders, even in patients
      who have not responded well to conventional pharmacotherapies.

TI  - Measuring the costs of schizophrenia. Implications for the post-institutional era
      in the US.
PG  - 199-222
AB  - Schizophrenia is a stress-related biomedical condition of the brain,
      characterised by unusual internal experiences, severe and often persistent
      functional disability and socially inappropriate behaviour. It is estimated that 
      schizophrenia affects approximately 1% of all adults worldwide. Young adults are 
      especially vulnerable. It is an illness with profound economic impact on
      patients, their families and society at large. Before the 1950s, most patients
      with schizophrenia were admitted to hospital for long inpatient stays. Keeping
      the patient in an institutional setting was all that psychiatry could offer,
      because there was little active treatment available. After World War II, and
      especially following the introduction of chlorpromazine in 1954, treatment was
      offered increasingly in outpatient settings. At present, more than 90% of
      individuals with schizophrenia will receive most healthcare services in
      outpatient facilities, supplemented by brief hospital treatment. The trend toward
      community-based care continues into the 1990s, supported in part by recent
      pharmacotherapeutic developments that are making a new generation of drug
      treatment options available. Clozapine, the most widely used of these new drugs, 
      has been the subject of several studies that compared its costs with those of
      conventional drug treatments. These early studies suggest that further reductions
      in the cost of hospital treatment are possible in the near future. At the same
      time, despite the increasing availability of effective treatment in outpatient
      settings, the shift of resources from institutional to community care will not
      occur as quickly as some might wish. Delays in the transformation of care systems
      are caused by political interest groups and the sheer inertia of the
      infrastructure left over from the era of institutional care. These factors must
      be taken into account in estimating the cost of schizophrenia care during the
      next decade. The aim of this review is to provide a clinical picture of
      schizophrenia, emphasising features that contribute most to the cost of illness. 
      We define and quantify the direct and indirect costs of the illness, discuss the 
      cost implications of new pharmacotherapeutic and psychosocial treatments, and
      critique strategies for measuring the economic efficacy of these new treatments. 
      The difficulties in measuring the costs of schizophrenia that are related to the 
      transition from institutional to community-based systems of care in the US are
      also reviewed.

TI  - Effect of risperidone on hostility in schizophrenia.
PG  - 243-9
AB  - The objective was to examine effects of risperidone on hostility and compare
      these effects with those of haloperidol. On the basis of risperidone's
      pharmacologic profile, we hypothesized that risperidone has a selective effect on
      hostility and that this effect is greater than that of haloperidol. The data were
      obtained in a multicenter clinical trial of risperidone under placebo-controlled,
      double-blind conditions (duration, 9 weeks). The patients were 139 patients with 
      the diagnosis of DSM-III-R schizophrenia. Hostility was measured by the
      "hostility" item of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Change in hostility
      served as a dependent variable in the analyses. Change in "psychosis" was applied
      as a covariate; it helped us examine changes in hostility that were unrelated to 
      change in psychosis (selective effect). Risperidone had a greater selective
      effect on hostility than did haloperidol or placebo. This finding should
      encourage tests of risperidone as a treatment for patients who show frequent
      overt physical aggression.

TI  - Safety, tolerability, and effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of iloperidone
      (HP 873), a potential atypical antipsychotic.
PG  - 713-20
AB  - Iloperidone (HP 873) is a D2 and 5-HT2 receptor-antagonist that is under
      development as a potential atypical antipsychotic agent. Two studies on
      iloperidone evaluated its safety and tolerability, made a preliminary
      pharmacokinetic assessment of single 3- and 5-mg doses, and determined the effect
      of food on its tolerability and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers after
      single 3-mg doses. Iloperidone was well absorbed orally in fasted subjects. The
      Cmax occurred approximately 2 to 3 hours after administration of a single 3- or
      5-mg dose. The pharmacokinetic parameters increased with the dose between 3 and 5
      mg (from 2.2 to 5.2 ng/mL for Cmax, and 16 to 50 ng/mL.h for AUC). Iloperidone
      was eliminated slowly, with a mean t1/2 of 13.5 to 14.0 hours. Coadministration
      with food did not significantly affect AUC, tmax, or Cmax. These results indicate
      that the rate of iloperidone's absorption is decreased, but the overall
      bioavailability is unchanged, when the drug is taken with food. Orthostatic
      hypotension, dizziness, and somnolence were the most commonly reported adverse
      events. Coadministration of food reduced the incidence and severity of these
      events.

TI  - Seroquel (ICI 204 636), a putative "atypical" antipsychotic, in schizophrenia
      with positive symptomatology: results of an open clinical trial and changes of
      neuroendocrinological and EEG parameters.
PG  - 231-8
AB  - Preclinical data indicated that seroquel (ICI 204 636), a dibenzothiazepine with 
      5-HT2 and D2-like receptor antagonistic properties, might be an effective
      antipsychotic agent, causing fewer extrapyramidal side effects than typical
      neuroleptics. In the present study, 12 patients suffering from schizophrenia or
      schizophreniform disorder with predominantly positive symptomatology were treated
      in an open clinical trial for 4 weeks with seroquel at a maximum dosage of 750
      mg/day. The drug was generally well tolerated, and virtually no adverse
      extrapyramidal side effects such as acute dystonia, parkinsonism or akathisia
      were observed. Total scores for BPRS (item score 0-6; baseline: 42.0 +/- 2.3;
      mean +/- SEM), SAPS (64.5 +/- 4.8) and SANS (55.0 +/- 4.3) showed a moderate
      decrease at the end of treatment (BPRS: 30.0 +/- 3.5; SAPS: 36.1 +/- 6.7; SANS:
      42.5 +/- 5.9), when intention-to-treat analysis was applied. There were
      considerable interindividual differences in treatment response, with some
      subjects showing almost full remission of positive symptoms, in contrast to about
      half of the patients who showed no satisfactory clinical improvement.
      Interestingly, patients showing good antipsychotic response reported slight
      initial side effects like mild sedation. Prolactin and TSH levels were not
      altered during seroquel administration. As to pharmaco-EEG investigations,
      seroquel caused a moderate increase of the absolute power in the alpha, theta,
      and beta frequency bands, paralleled by a decrease of delta activity. There were 
      no signs of paroxysmal EEG activity under seroquel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - A clinical study of clozapine treatment and predictors of response in a Canadian 
      sample.
PG  - 208-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical response to clozapine in patients with
      refractory schizophrenia. METHOD: Open trial of clozapine in 61
      consecutively-treated patients. RESULTS: Following clozapine, the level of
      function of patients was improved relative to admission (p = 0.0001) and to the
      highest level in the previous year (p = 0.0001). Severity of illness was
      decreased (p = 0.0001). Overall, 31% of the patients were classified as
      responders to clozapine and the responders were all identified by 32 weeks of
      treatment. Poor functioning in the previous year was associated with less
      favourable response. At a mean interval of 26 months following discharge, 72% of 
      the patients were continuing clozapine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This open trial of
      patients who were treated consecutively indicates a comparable degree of response
      to clozapine as observed in controlled clinical trials, and that level of
      functioning in the previous year was the best predictor of response.

TI  - The use of placebos in clinical trials for acute schizophrenia.
PG  - 171-6
AB  - This review examines the scientific and ethical justification for the use of
      randomized concurrent placebo-controlled trials in the treatment of acute relapse
      in chronic schizophrenia. A literature search was conducted, and the national
      regulatory authority was consulted. Many placebo-controlled studies of acute or
      chronic schizophrenia are being published and it is the official position of both
      the Canadian and US regulatory authorities that such studies are required for
      both scientific and ethical reasons. The specific strengths and limitations of
      placebo-controlled studies are reviewed. Examples, drawn from Canadian studies,
      are presented to illustrate their benefits. It is concluded that the use of
      placebos in the particular situation of acute or chronic schizophrenia is
      ethically and scientifically justified. It forms an essential component of a
      comprehensive drug evaluation for new antipsychotic medications.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of risperidone in the long-term treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 402-12
AB  - The long-term efficacy and safety of risperidone were evaluated in patients with 
      chronic schizophrenia in an open-label study. Thirty-two patients received
      risperidone for 1 year and 19 of the 32 received risperidone for 2 years. The
      mean dose of risperidone was 9.4 mg/d in the 1-year follow-up. At the end of 1
      and 2 years, improvements were found in total scores on the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS), on four PANSS factors (positive, negative, excited, and
      cognitive), and the Clinical Global Impression scale. Severity of extrapyramidal 
      symptoms (based on scores on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale) was also
      reduced. Clinical improvement (defined as a 20% or more reduction in total PANSS 
      scores) was shown by 54% of the patients at end point. Social functioning (as
      assessed by using the modified Strauss/Carpenter scale) was significantly
      improved after 2 years. Number of days spent in hospitals was significantly
      reduced during the 2 years of treatment, and the number of days in treatment
      (group) homes significantly increased. It is concluded that treatment with
      risperidone for 1 and 2 years is associated with significant reductions in
      symptoms of schizophrenia, improved social functioning, and reduction in days
      spent in the hospital.

TI  - ICI 204,636, a novel, atypical antipsychotic: early indication of safety and
      efficacy in patients with chronic and subchronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 366-78
AB  - We evaluated the effects of ICI 204,636 in 12 hospitalized patients with
      schizophrenia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, rising-dose 
      study. Patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
      Third Edition, Revised criteria for chronic or subchronic schizophrenia and had a
      total score > or = 30 on the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and a 
      score > or = 3 on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity of Illness item. 
      Patients received 21 days of double-blind treatment with increasing doses of ICI 
      204,636 (25 to 250 mg/d) or placebo. Efficacy was assessed using the BPRS and
      CGI. Response to treatment was defined as a > or = 30% decrease in the BPRS total
      score from baseline. Extrapyramidal symptoms and abnormal involuntary movements
      were assessed using the Simpson Scale and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale.
      Changes from baseline in the BPRS and CGI were significantly greater at end point
      for patients who received ICI 204,636 versus placebo (BPRS, -20.9 vs -4.8; CGI,
      -2.9 vs -1.0; P < 0.05, analysis of covariance; P < or = 0.06, Wilcoxon rank sum 
      test). All patients in the ICI 204,636 group responded to treatment (P < 0.10)
      versus only two patients in the placebo group. Mild somnolence occurred in 50% of
      ICI 204,636-treated patients. No treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms or
      dystonic reactions were observed. ICI 204,636 showed efficacy in the positive and
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia and was well tolerated.

TI  - Treatment of polydipsia and hyponatremia in psychiatric patients. Can clozapine
      be a new option?
PG  - 133-8
AB  - Polydipsia occurs frequently in chronic schizophrenic patients, some of whom
      develop intermittent hyponatremia. Most therapeutic efforts have tried to control
      the hyponatremia. Four schizophrenic patients, followed for more than one year,
      showed improvement on clozapine. Case 1 was an outpatient without history of
      hyponatremia who improved from polydipsia and psychosis. The last three were
      inpatients with polydipsia, intermittent hyponatremia, and psychosis who showed
      minimal improvement of psychosis but significant decrease in polydipsia and water
      intoxication. Case 2 relapsed to polydipsia when clozapine was discontinued on
      two occasions. Case 3 demonstrated polyuria during 39% of days before clozapine
      and in 0% of days after two weeks of clozapine. In case 4, most baseline sodium
      levels were abnormal, but all became normal after clozapine. A time-series
      analysis for intervention effects showed a significant effect of clozapine (p =
      .017). The limited information provided by these case reports suggest the need
      for controlled studies of the clozapine effect on polydipsic patients.

TI  - Relation of leukocyte counts during clozapine treatment to serum concentrations
      of clozapine and metabolites.
PG  - 610-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was done to test the hypothesis that serum concentration of
      norclozapine is a risk factor for leukopenia during treatment with clozapine.
      METHOD: Maximum decreases in leukocyte counts in 44 unselected patients treated
      with clozapine were determined and then correlated with drug doses and serum
      concentrations of clozapine, norclozapine, and clozapine-N-oxide. RESULTS: White 
      cell and granulocyte counts decreased by up to 60%-73%, but there were no
      positive correlations between these decrements and drug dose, drug level, ratio
      of drug level to drug dose, or ratio of norclozapine level to clozapine level,
      nor were the decreases related to age or gender. CONCLUSIONS: While these results
      do not suggest in vivo hemotoxicity of norclozapine, further study of patients
      with clinically significant leukopenia is required.

TI  - Can low-dose clozapine pharmacokinetics predict steady-state plasma
      concentration?
PG  - 137-41
AB  - Plasma concentrations of clozapine at a given dose vary considerably between
      patients, but drug levels are not routinely monitored during the normal 4- to
      8-week dose escalation period at the beginning of therapy. We hypothesized that
      the dose required to give a putative threshold therapeutic concentration of 350
      micrograms/L could be individualized using pharmacokinetic predictions made at
      the beginning of normal dose escalation. Low-dose clozapine (25-75 mg every 12 h)
      was administered to 21 treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia who had
      been split into three groups. In group A (six patients), individual target doses 
      were predicted from area under the concentration-time curve data after a single
      50-mg dose. In group B (five patients), predictions were made as in group A but
      at steady state. In group C (10 patients), predictions were based on trough
      clozapine levels obtained at steady state immediately before dose increase.
      Dosage was increased, if tolerated, by 25 mg twice daily three times a week for
      4-8 weeks according to established clinical practice. Clozapine concentrations
      were measured weekly, and actual target doses were determined for each patient
      from dose-concentration plots. In groups A and B, the correlation between actual 
      and predicted target dose was not significant (r = 0.18, p = 0.59). In group C,
      however, it was significant (r = 0.86, p = 0.0016). These results suggest that
      individualized doses of clozapine for treatment-resistant patients with
      schizophrenia can be conveniently predicted from trough drug levels at the start 
      of therapy. Such information would facilitate a more rapid, individualized, and
      consistent attainment of therapeutic doses than is now the case in clinical
      practice.

TI  - [Clozapine in the treatment of mental manifestations of Parkinson disease].
PG  - 251-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical treatment of Parkinsonian syndromes is often complicated by
      psychiatric side effects such as confusional states, hallucinations and
      psychosis. Recent pilot studies report good clinical results with the atypical
      neuroleptic clozapine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on 15 patients with
      Parkinsonian syndromes: 11 with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), 3 with
      multiple system atrophy (MSA) and 1 with postencephalitic Parkinsonism (SPP). The
      mean age was 68.8 +/- 10 years; the mean duration of Parkinsonian symptoms was
      6.8 +/- 5.7 years. The Hoehn & Yahr grade was: 3.5 +/- 0.8. Eleven patients were 
      suffering from psychotic episodes, 10 from hallucinations, 8 from confusional
      states. Clozpine was introduced at nighttime and dosage was modified until the
      appearance of clinical effect or intolerable side effects. RESULTS: We report on 
      an observed cumulative duration of clozapine treatment of 13 patient-years. The
      average treatment duration was 10.5 +/- 10.4 months. The mean daily dose was 33.3
      +/- 30 mg (range: 6.2-100). There was at least transitory improvement of
      psychiatric symptoms in all patients. There was constant and complete improvement
      in 7 patients (46%) and satisfactory improvement in 5 patients (33.3%). The
      levodopa dosage was unchanged (mean dosage 563 +/- 232 mg), and the dosage of
      dopamine agonists was significantly increased. None of our patients experienced
      motor deterioration. Side effects comprised sialorrhoea, sedation, orthostatic
      hypotension, and delirium tremens and an epileptic seizure in one patient each.
      Two patients died suddenly at the 63rd and at the 86th day of treatment
      respectively, outside the hospital. These deaths seemed to be unrelated to the
      treatment. There was no agranulocytosis. CONCLUSION: Clozapine is an efficient
      antipsychotic drug in Parkinsonian patients with no motor side effects in the
      dosages used. The effective dosage is very low in comparison to psychiatric
      patients. However various side effects may occur and close monitoring is
      required.

PG  - 432-4
AB  - Delusions and other manifestations of psychotic behavior are common side effects 
      in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients chronically treated with dopaminergic drugs.
      Clozapine, a dibenzodiazepine derivative, is an antipsychotic drug largely devoid
      of extrapyramidal side effects. We evaluated the effects of low doses of
      clozapine on the mental and motor functions in PD patients requiring
      antipsychotic treatment. Twenty-seven PD patients taking dopaminergic drugs and
      who had psychotic behavior received clozapine at 12.5 to 75 mg/d. Fifteen
      patients received clozapine for 1 to 11 months (mean, 6.8 months) and seven
      received it for 12 to 24 months (mean, 18 months). No patient exhibited motor
      deterioration, and the psychotic features disappeared immediately, allowing
      discontinuation of clozapine after several months in 10 patients. Fifteen
      patients are still receiving clozapine and are free of psychiatric symptoms. The 
      clozapine treatment was discontinued after 5 days (25 mg/d) in two patients
      because of somnolence. No patient developed neutropenia. Clozapine in low doses
      is effective in the treatment of drug-induced delusions and hallucinations in PD.

TI  - Is clozapine a mood stabilizer?
PG  - 108-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine has been increasingly shown to be effective in the acute
      and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorders. For this reason, we studied
      whether clozapine alone is effective as a mood stabilizer in patients with
      refractory bipolar disorders. METHOD: Subjects were part of a long-term follow-up
      study cohort of 193 patients with refractory mood disorders who were treated with
      clozapine at McLean Hospital prior to July 1, 1992. Patients included in this
      study were those older than 16 years with bipolar disorder (manic or mixed) and
      schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, discharged taking clozapine alone (N =
      17). Hospital records on all patients were reviewed by trained raters blind to
      "best-estimate" diagnoses. Response to clozapine was determined by the Clinical
      Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. Patients were contacted at least 6 
      months after clozapine initiation for semistructured follow-up interviews by
      raters blind to diagnosis and baseline information. RESULTS: Seventeen subjects
      were contacted 16.1 +/- 5.6 months after clozapine initiation. Most of the 17
      patients had previously failed trials of lithium, valproate, carbamazepine,
      neuroleptics, combinations of these, and electroconvulsive therapy; or had
      tardive dyskinesia. Of these patients, 65% (11/17) continued to be on clozapine
      therapy alone at follow-up and had no subsequent rehospitalization or affective
      episode. At follow-up, there was a significant decrease in the rehospitalization 
      rate (p = .025) than before starting clozapine and a significant improvement in
      CGI-I scores (p = .02). CONCLUSION: Clozapine monotherapy is an effective mood
      stabilizer, reducing both the number of affective episodes and rehospitalizations
      in patients with severe refractory bipolar illness.

TI  - Clozapine serum levels and side effects during steady state treatment of
      schizophrenic patients: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 371-8
AB  - Serum clozapine (S-Cloza) and serum desmethyl-clozapine concentrations
      (S-Descloza) were measured in 30 chronic schizophrenic in- and out-patients on a 
      variable dose regimen. All patients were in steady state with respect to
      clozapine therapy and in a stable condition with respect to psychotic illness.
      The 24-h clozapine dose (median with interquartile range in parenthesis) was 350 
      (228-425) mg/24 h (range 100-700). There was a weak positive correlation between 
      doses and the BPRS total score (r = 0.44, P < 0.05). The median S-Cloza was 1076 
      (706-1882) nmol/l (range 196-5581 corresponding to 64-1824 ng/ml). The S-Cloza
      was linearly correlated to dose but with a high interindividual variation at
      equal doses, e.g. a factor of 8 at 400 mg/24 h, but a low intraindividual
      variability of 20%. The S-Descloza averaged 77% of the S-Cloza and was highly
      correlated to S-Cloza (r = 0.90; P < 0.001). The S-Descloza/dose ratio increased 
      with age and duration of treatment. The side effects registered were EEG
      abnormalities (83%), tachycardia (23%), increased liver enzyme activity (60%),
      orthostatic hypotension (17%), and moderate leucocytosis (17%). Only EEG changes 
      were correlated to S-Cloza (r = 0.43; P < 0.05). The score values of the UKU Side
      Effect Scale were weakly (r = 0.36) correlated to S-Cloza. No side effects were
      correlated to S-Descloza, doses, or treatment duration. The frequency of side
      effects was higher than in studies using lower mean doses indicating a
      correlation between doses or S-Cloza and the frequency of side effects. It is
      concluded that clozapine fulfils the criteria for therapeutic drug monitoring.

PG  - 229-34
AB  - In order to examine the effect of neuroleptic medication on the factor structure 
      of schizophrenic symptomatology, 517 DSM-III-R schizophrenic in-patients enrolled
      in a multicenter phase II drug study were evaluated on their pre-existing
      neuroleptic at screening on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and 
      after a one-week drug-free period. Separate principal components analyses of the 
      PANSS were done at each time point. PANSS total and component scores were
      assessed for differences utilizing paired t-tests. Both factor analyses confirmed
      the five factor model (negative, positive, cognitive, excitement and depression
      components) explaining 51.7 and 56.2% of the variances at each time point. After 
      medication wash-out psychopathology significantly worsened as measured by total
      PANSS score and by each of the components. The overall worsening of component
      scores appeared global and uniform, as evidenced by the fact that at washout, the
      proportion of individual component scores to total psychopathology remained
      constant for most components. The lack of change of most components in proportion
      to the psychopathology total is evidence for the stability of these individual
      psychopathological dimensions of patients while on and off neuroleptics. The
      results further support the validity of the five-factor model of schizophrenic
      psychopathology as measured by the PANSS.

      250 schizophrenic patients from 4 ethnic groups: 39 Blacks, 66 Caucasians, 82
      Chinese, and 63 Mexican Americans. The distribution of the reduced haloperidol to
      haloperidol concentration (RH/HL) ratios was bimodal in all ethnic groups, with
      the antimode determined by probit plot as 0.46, 0.51, 0.36, and 0.76,
      respectively. With these antimodes, the proportion of patients with low RH/HL
      ratios were 41%, 42%, 73%, and 57% in the four ethnic groups, respectively.
      Compared with the other three ethnic groups, in the Chinese patients the ratio
      was lower. The mean RH/HL ratio in the Chinese was 0.34 compared with 0.81 to
      0.87 in the non-Chinese groups. In 53 patients who were treated with two or more 
      haloperidol dosage regimens, steady-state haloperidol and reduced haloperidol
      drug concentrations obtained from the different regimens were positively
      correlated with the haloperidol dose (R = .79 and R = .62, respectively). Our
      data suggest not only the existence of a bimodal distribution in the RH/HL ratio,
      but also that the antimode separating the low and high ratio subgroups is
      different among the various ethnic groups.

TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of risperidone in schizophrenia.
PG  - 139-45
AB  - The atypical antipsychotic risperidone combines dopaminergic and serotonergic
      antagonism. This results in a drug that is both clinically effective, reducing
      positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and has a low incidence of
      adverse effects. At a dosage of 4 to 8 mg/day, risperidone is comparable to 10
      mg/day of haloperidol. This dosage has a low incidence of extrapyramidal adverse 
      effects and is nonsedative, although it may cause orthostatic hypotension. There 
      is no current evidence for specific biochemical and haematological abnormalities 
      associated with risperidone. Although the clinical benefits appear to outweigh
      the risks, this drug continues to be a relatively expensive treatment option in
      the UK. There is therefore a need for a formal cost-utility assessment of
      risperidone and for comparisons between this drug and other atypical
      neuroleptics.

      in the driver's seat?
PG  - 735-44
AB  - Although it is well known that clinical trial findings and actual clinical
      experience can differ substantially in pharmaceutical decisionmaking, it is our
      working hypothesis that this divergence is critically important in the area of
      psychopharmacology. We support this contention with a discussion of recent
      findings from post-marketing pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacoeconomic
      investigations of clozapine. The pharmacoeconomic evaluations purport to show
      cost savings of clozapine versus standard neuroleptic therapy but these
      conclusions are flawed, in large part because the epidemiologic investigations on
      which they are based are inadequate. To correct this situation, long-term,
      randomized field trials (usual practice settings) are needed to compare costs and
      outcomes of clozapine versus standard therapy. The design of these studies should
      incorporate multidimensional outcomes, including social function, employment, and
      rehospitalization, as well as measures of symptoms and self-reported quality of
      life. Pharmacoeconomic evaluations that adopt the designs of typical clinical
      trials with limited outcome measures, such as symptoms or self-reported quality
      of life measures, will not be sufficient to determine cost-effectiveness for
      psychopharmacologic therapies of severe mental disorders.

TI  - Risperidone use in a teaching hospital during its first year after market
      approval: economic and clinical implications.
PG  - 719-25
AB  - Risperidone, a new antipsychotic drug, was recently approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) on the basis of its having comparable efficacy and less
      toxicity than haloperidol. In a preliminary study to evaluate the therapeutic
      efficiency of this drug, we conducted a survey of resperidone utilization, cost, 
      and safety during its first year of availability at an academic psychiatric
      hospital. Data were obtained from a computerized, centralized medical record
      system, from an adverse drug reaction monitoring system, and from pharmacy
      purchasing records. In its first year of availability, risperidone became the
      second most widely used antipsychotic agent at our institution. Most of this use 
      extended beyond the adult schizophrenia population, for whom pre-marketing safety
      and efficacy data are available. The direct institutional cost of risperidone
      treatment exceeded the entire budget for antipsychotic drugs during the year
      before its release. Results from the adverse drug reaction reporting system did
      not indicate a strong advantage of risperidone over more established
      antipsychotic agents with respect to extrapyramidal side effects. Furthermore,
      the mean dose of risperidone associated with extrapyramidal symptoms was 3.5
      mg/day, considerably lower than that suggested by pre-marketing studies in a more
      select patient group. These results confirm that new pharmacological agents are
      generally used in much broader patient populations than those for which efficacy 
      and safety have been established prior to FDA approval. This study also raises
      questions about the therapeutic efficiency of risperidone compared with other
      antipsychotic drugs. We conclude that systematic studies of outcome, safety, and 
      cost of new pharmaceuticals in naturalistic settings are needed to provide the
      data necessary to establish local standards of cost-effective care.

      risperidone in persons with schizophrenia. Nine published double-blind studies
      compare risperidone with another antipsychotic medication and/or placebo. All
      were conducted in the acute phase of illness. Risperidone's antipsychotic
      efficacy is shown to be consistently superior to that of placebo and at least
      comparable to that of haloperidol and perphenazine for patients in the acute
      phase of schizophrenia. Further research is necessary to determine the
      effectiveness of risperidone and its efficacy both as a maintenance treatment and
      in treatment-refractory and deficit-state patients.

AB  - Clozapine (Clozaril) represents the first major advance in the pharmacological
      treatment of schizophrenia since the introduction of antipsychotics into clinical
      practice in the 1950s. Studies consistently support its efficacy for reducing
      positive symptoms in acutely psychotic patients and in treatment-resistant
      patients, for preventing positive symptom exacerbations as a maintenance
      treatment, and for reducing symptoms of hostility and violence. There is evidence
      to suggest that clozapine may improve social and occupational functioning and
      quality of life and may reduce affective symptoms, hospitalizations, secondary
      negative symptoms, and tardive dyskinesia. Its most significant side effects
      include agranulocytosis, seizures, weight gain, hypotension and tachycardia,
      sedation, and perhaps rebound psychosis (with abrupt discontinuation of
      medication).

AB  - This report describes a method for determination of clozapine and its major
      metabolites N-desmethylclozapine and clozapine N-oxide in serum samples of
      adolescent schizophrenic patients during maintenance therapy. The method includes
      deproteinization and subsequent high-performance liquid chromatography with
      electrochemical detection. The method shows sufficient sensitivity to quantitate 
      clozapine, clozapine N-oxide and N-desmethylclozapine accurately at 0.5, 5, and
      0.5 ng/ml, respectively. We were able to demonstrate for 16 patients receiving
      fixed doses of clozapine that the individual mean values calculated from six
      consecutive measurements revealed a strong linear dosage and serum level
      relationship (Pearson's coefficient of correlation): clozapine (r = 0.82, p =
      0.0001); N-desmethylclozapine (r = 0.81, p = 0.0001); clozapine N-oxide (r =
      0.91; p = 0.0001). Preliminary pharmacokinetic data are presented and
      dose-response relationship are discussed.

TI  - Dopamine D2 receptor blockade in vivo with the novel antipsychotics risperidone
      and remoxipride--an 123I-IBZM single photon emission tomography (SPET) study.
PG  - 55-61
AB  - Risperidone and remoxipride are recently introduced atypical antipsychotics, with
      clinical efficacy comparable to that of classical antipsychotics but lower
      propensity to induce extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). It is unclear whether
      these properties relate to weak dopamine D2 receptor blockade in vivo, as has
      been suggested for the archetypal atypical antipsychotic clozapine. We have used 
      123I-IBZM single photon emission tomography (SPET) to characterize the patterns
      of striatal D2 receptor binding in vivo in DSMIII-R-diagnosed schizophrenic and
      schizo-affective patients treated with either risperidone (n = 6) or remoxipride 
      (n = 4) but predominantly EPS free. These groups were compared to age- and BPRS- 
      matched subjects from a previously reported D2 receptor binding database of
      patients treated with clozapine (n = 10) and classical antipsychotics (n = 10).
      Patients on risperidone and remoxipride had high levels of D2 receptor blockade, 
      comparable to those of patients on classical antipsychotics, and significantly
      greater than those obtained with clozapine-treated patients (risperidone versus
      clozapine, P < 0.005; remoxipride versus clozapine, P < 0.025). These results
      suggest high levels of striatal D2 receptor occupancy in association with
      remoxipride and risperidone treatment and argue against modest D2 antagonism as
      the explanation for the low incidence of EPS associated with these drugs.

TI  - A comparison of European and American dosing regimens of schizophrenic patients
      on clozapine: efficacy and side effects.
PG  - 315-20
AB  - We present a comparison of the results from two studies of patients on clozapine.
      The American study (n = 84; Hillside Hospital, Glen Oaks, NY) and the European
      study (n = 63; Innsbruck University Clinics, Innsbruck, Austria) both examine
      efficacy and side effects in schizophrenic patients on this atypical neuroleptic.
      There is a very substantial difference in the dosing regimen used on both
      continents and this is reflected in the studies reported. A question with major
      clinical implications is whether the higher doses commonly used in the United
      States lead to a better outcome or a different profile of side effects. Outcome
      as a function of serum concentration will be examined. Results confirm a lower
      dose, lower clozapine blood level, and a lesser degree of side effects in the
      Austrian cohort when compared to the American sample. Surprisingly, the clinical 
      efficacy of the lower dosing regimen was superior to the higher dose. Reasons for
      this anomaly are explored.

TI  - Clozapine therapy for Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders.
PG  - 3047-53
AB  - Recent research on the role of clozapine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease 
      and other movement disorders is discussed. Most clinical trials have shown
      resolution of or improvement in psychotic symptoms accompanying Parkinson's
      disease without worsening of parkinsonian symptoms. Adverse effects appear to be 
      mild at dosages of < 100 mg/day; sedation is the most frequent problem. Most of
      these studies have serious limitations, however; until better studies have been
      completed, the decision to use clozapine for Parkinson's disease-related
      psychosis should be made on a case-by-case basis, with thorough evaluation of
      risks, benefits, and other therapeutic options. Some patients with Parkinson's
      disease have shown improvement in tremor and other abnormal movements when given 
      clozapine. Clozapine cannot be recommended for treating tardive dyskinesia on the
      basis of the research done so far; some trials show dramatic resolution of
      symptoms, others no benefit. Anticholinergics or dopamine-reuptake inhibitors
      should be considered before clozapine is given to patients with tardive
      dyskinesia because of clozapine's potential for serious adverse effects. A few
      patients with Huntington's disease have responded to clozapine, but again no
      conclusions can be drawn. Clozapine appears to offer no real advantage over
      haloperidol for treating choreiform movements in Huntington's disease. The
      frequency of tics in Tourette's syndrome does not seem to be reduced by
      clozapine. Clozapine has shown some efficacy as a treatment for psychosis and
      abnormal movements in Parkinson's disease. Results have been less promising for
      other movement disorders. Further study in larger populations is needed before
      any definitive conclusions about clozapine's place in movement disorder therapy
      can be made.

TI  - The Neuropsychiatric Inventory: comprehensive assessment of psychopathology in
      dementia.
PG  - 2308-14
AB  - We developed a new instrument, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), to assess 10
      behavioral disturbances occurring in dementia patients: delusions,
      hallucinations, dysphoria, anxiety, agitation/aggression, euphoria,
      disinhibition, irritability/lability, apathy, and aberrant motor activity. The
      NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and
      scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening
      questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined.
      Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's 
      behavior. Studies reported here demonstrate the content and concurrent validity
      as well as between-rater, test-retest, and internal consistency reliability; the 
      instrument is both valid and reliable. The NPI has the advantages of evaluating a
      wider range of psychopathology than existing instruments, soliciting information 
      that may distinguish among different etiologies of dementia, differentiating
      between severity and frequency of behavioral changes, and minimizing
      administration time.

TI  - [Effect of clozapine on biogenic amines within the scope of drug treatment of
      schizophrenic psychoses in adolescence].
PG  - 285-98
AB  - Longitudinal assessments (every six weeks for one year) were made of plasma
      norepinephrine, dopamine, epinephrine and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) 
      in 40 adolescents with schizophrenia, 20 on clozapine therapy and 20 on
      conventional medication. In addition to the plasma catecholamine determinations, 
      serum levels of 5-HT were determined as a measure of serotoninergic status. All
      analyses were performed by HPLC-ECD (high-performance liquid chromatography with 
      electrochemical detection). Clinical ratings of symptomatology were obtained with
      the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Andreasen scales for negative
      and positive symptoms (SANS and SAPS). Compared with the typical neuroleptic
      medication, clozapine administration was accompanied by a significant increase in
      plasma norepinephrine and MPHG and serum serotonin levels. The fluctuations in
      the biogenic amines were closely associated with the observed symptomatology.
      Plasma MHPG was linked to depressive symptoms (BPRS), and negative symptoms
      (SANS) were related to changes in the serum serotonin levels. The
      pathophysiological implications and clinical consequences of these findings are
      discussed.

TI  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: pharmacologic profiles and potential
      therapeutic distinctions.
PG  - 1359-69
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the respective pharmacologic profiles of the selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), with particular emphasis placed on
      clinically relevant distinctions. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was conducted to
      identify English language literature published within the last five years on the 
      four SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine). Previous review
      articles were scrutinized for additional citations, and manufacturers provided a 
      contemporary bibliography of more recent material. STUDY SELECTION/DATA
      EXTRACTION: Studies were selected for specific citation on the basis of
      comparative research merit and the contribution of this original literature to
      the pharmacologic profile(s) described. DATA SYNTHESIS: All SSRIs appear to be
      more efficacious than placebo for the acute treatment of major depressive
      disorder (MDD). Short-term (six-week) efficacy was comparable with that of
      tricyclic antidepressants for the amelioration of MDD regarded as moderate in
      severity. Further comparative trials are clearly indicated to demonstrate the
      therapeutic benefits of SSRIs in specific populations (e.g., geriatric, severely 
      ill) and to demonstrate sustained benefit with long-term prophylaxis. Other
      potential indications for SSRIs include obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic
      disorder, bulimia, and chronic pain syndromes. Pharmacokinetic profiles of the
      four SSRIs reveal similar parametric values, and most quantitative differences
      are of limited clinical significance. Adverse effects are common but ordinarily
      mild and transient, primarily restricted to the gastrointestinal tract and
      central nervous system. Important differences in the prevalence or severity of
      these adverse effects await the accumulation of further clinical experience and
      the completion of additional comparative trials. Similarly, the relative
      propensity of SSRIs to inhibit the metabolism of other medications is currently
      under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The four SSRIs studied appear to be more
      similar than they are different. Slowly, important distinctions are beginning to 
      emerge with regard to adverse effect profiles and potential drug interactions.
      Given that the costs of these respective medications are comparable, such
      differences may ultimately serve to establish the preferential selection of
      individual agents in specific clinical situations.

TI  - Allelic variation in the D4 dopamine receptor (DRD4) gene does not predict
      response to clozapine.
PG  - 912-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that interindividual differences in response to
      clozapine therapy might be attributable to the D4 dopamine receptor (DRD4)
      alleles they carry. Different alleles of the D4 dopamine receptor, coded by the
      DRD4 gene, differ in the affinity with which they bind the atypical antipsychotic
      drug clozapine in vitro. This may have physiologic implications. Clinical
      response to clozapine therapy varies among patients. The observation that, in
      vitro, clozapine binds the protein products of different DRD4 alleles with
      differing affinity characteristics suggested this hypothesis. METHOD: The region 
      of the DRD4 gene that encodes the putative third cytoplasmic loop of the D4
      receptor contains a 48-base pair sequence repeated a variable number of times.
      With use of polymerase chain reaction amplification, we assessed this variable
      number of tandem repeats polymorphism in a series of schizophrenic and
      schizoaffective subjects who had been treated with clozapine, and related
      genotype with treatment response, to test the hypothesis that DRD4 alleles lead
      to varying response to clozapine. RESULTS: Allelic variation at the DRD4 locus
      does not predict clinical response to clozapine relative to either fluphenazine
      hydrochloride or placebo in subjects with treatment-refractory schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. CONCLUSIONS: DRD4 alleles do not predict therapeutic
      response to clozapine in schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. There are
      implications from these data for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the
      mechanism of clozapine's therapeutic effect are discussed.

AB  - Clozapine, a dibenzodiazepine derivative, has potent antipsychotic activity. But 
      bone marrow suppression resulting in agranulocytosis has been associated with
      clozapine treatment; thus its clinical development has been delayed and the
      administration of this drug has been restricted to treatment-resistant
      schizophrenic patient. This report describes an open prospective study of the
      effects of clozapine on symptomatology of patients who are refractory to
      neuroleptics. Authors prospectively followed up until 36 months, 20 DSM III-R
      schizophrenic patients who had failed to respond to various neuroleptics (7.7 +/-
      3.0). When clozapine treatment was initiated, the mean duration of the illness
      was 17 +/- 10 years. Various scales were used for evaluation: total BPRS, BPRS
      "positive symptoms", BPRS "negative symptoms", PANSS positive and PANSS negative 
      were realized at days 0 and 15, months 1, 2 and 3 and then every 3 months.
      Significative improvements in total BPRS, BPRS positive symptoms and PANSS
      positive were noted at day 15 (p < 0.005, p < 0.026, p < 0.02, respectively);
      clozapine produced significant improvement on the BPRS negative symptoms and the 
      PANSS negative at 1 month (p < 0.03 and p < 0.008, respectively). Side effects
      were studied: dry mouth was more prominent in the first month after wash-out
      (15%), while salivation was more and more prevalent (20% within the first month; 
      53% beyond). There was no agranulocytosis in this cohort; 2 cases (10%) of
      eosinophilia occurred during the first month; 20% of the patients experienced an 
      increase in total white blood cell count (> 12.000/mm3). Weight gain (> 5 kg)
      affected 32% of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Risperidone and clozapine in the treatment of drug-resistant schizophrenia and
      neuroleptic-induced supersensitivity psychosis.
PG  - 1129-41
AB  - 1. Supersensitivity psychosis (SSP) has emerged as a potential side effect of
      long-term neuroleptic therapy similar to tardive dyskinesia (TD). 2. Six
      schizophrenic patients with SSP, considered to be drug-resistant, were treated
      with risperidone, while another 5 were treated with clozapine. 3. The 6
      risperidone-treated patients (all women) were rated on the Clinical Global
      Impression Improvement Scale as at least very much improved. Among the 5
      clozapine-treated patients, all 4 men were found to have a marked response to
      clozapine, while the female patient was judged to be minimally improved. 4. It is
      hypothesized that not only TD but also SSP arise from destruction of cholinergic 
      interneurons in the striatum as a consequence of prolonged neuroleptic
      administration. Thus, the drug-induced parkinsonism, which was proposed as
      mediating the antipsychotic effect of dopamine D2 blocking drugs, depends on the 
      integrity of these cholinergic neurons. If these neurons are destroyed, drugs
      such as haloperidol lose their therapeutic effect. 5. In contrast, atypical
      neuroleptics like clozapine and risperidone reduce dopamine release in the
      striatum independently of prior production of extrapyramidal symptoms and, in
      this way, may be effective in psychotic illnesses unresponsive to classical
      anti-D2 neuroleptics. 6. In the present sample of patients, it is worth noting
      that schizophrenic men were good responders to clozapine. In comparison,
      risperidone was found to be efficacious in schizophrenic women.

TI  - Effects of a limit on Medicaid drug-reimbursement benefits on the use of
      psychotropic agents and acute mental health services by patients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 650-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the effects of a three-prescription monthly payment limit
      (cap) on the use of psychotropic drugs and acute mental health care by
      noninstitutionalized patients with schizophrenia. We hypothesized that reducing
      access to such drugs would increase the use of emergency mental health services
      and the rate of partial hospitalizations (full-day or half-day treatment
      programs) and psychiatric-hospital admissions. METHODS: We linked Medicaid claims
      data for a period of 42 months with clinical records from two community mental
      health centers (CMHCs) and the single state psychiatric hospital in New
      Hampshire, where Medicaid imposed a three-prescription limit on reimbursement for
      drugs during 11 months (months 15 through 25) of the study. For comparison, we
      used Medicaid claims for a period of 42 months in New Jersey, which had no limit 
      on drug reimbursement. The study patients (n = 268) and the comparison patients
      (n = 1959) were permanently disabled, noninstitutionalized patients with
      schizophrenia, 19 through 60 years of age, who were insured by Medicaid. We
      conducted interrupted time-series regression analyses to estimate the effects of 
      the cap on the use of medications and mental health services. RESULTS: The cap
      resulted in immediate reductions (range, 15 to 49 percent) in the use of
      antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants and lithium, and anxiolytic and hypnotic
      drugs (P < 0.01). It also resulted in coincident increases of one to two visits
      per patient per month in visits to CMHCs (range of increase, 43 to 57 percent; P 
      < 0.001) and sharp increases in the use of emergency mental health services and
      partial hospitalization (1.2 to 1.4 episodes per patient per month), but no
      change in the frequency of hospital admissions. After the cap was discontinued,
      the use of medications and most mental health services reverted to base-line
      levels (measured in the first 14 months of the study). The estimated average
      increase in mental health care costs per patient during the cap ($1,530) exceeded
      the savings in drug costs to Medicaid by a factor of 17. CONCLUSIONS: Limits on
      coverage for the costs of prescription drugs can increase the use of acute mental
      health services among low-income patients with chronic mental illnesses and
      increase costs to the government, even aside from the increases caused in pain
      and suffering on the part of patients.

TI  - Uses of clozapine in nonschizophrenic patients.
PG  - 142-50
AB  - Clozapine is a novel antipsychotic agent used in the treatment of schizophrenic
      patients who have not responded to or have been unable to tolerate conventional
      neuroleptic therapy. In this paper, the literature surveying the uses of
      clozapine in the treatment of patients with nonschizophrenic illnesses, in
      particular psychotic affective disorders (bipolar disorder and schizoaffective
      disorder), will be reviewed. (A Medline search was done for all papers concerning
      clozapine; those that represented major contributions to the literature were
      used.) Results from a prospective study at McLean Hospital assessing the effects 
      of diagnosis on response will be presented. Several other uses in
      nonschizophrenic patients will also be discussed. Because of its relative freedom
      from extrapyramidal side effects, it is an important agent in the treatment of
      patients with Parkinson's disease who also have psychotic symptoms. It may be
      effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in nearly 50% of patients with
      that symptom. In addition, the drug may be useful in treating violent patients
      and those with certain movement disorders, atypical borderline personality
      disorder, or chronic psychotic symptoms. Due to the risk of agranulocytosis,
      clozapine cannot yet be considered a first-choice treatment for psychotic
      symptoms, but many studies indicate it to be helpful with a wide variety of
      treatment-resistant ones.

TI  - Effects of clozapine, fluphenazine, and placebo on reaction time measures of
      attention and sensory dominance in schizophrenia.
PG  - 133-44
AB  - Two reaction time (RT) paradigms were used to study clozapine's effects on
      sustained and selective attention compared to fluphenazine and placebo in 25
      chronic schizophrenic patients. Sensory dominance was studied via simple and
      choice RTs to lights and tones, and on double-stimulus trials in which the two
      stimuli were presented simultaneously. Although 8 of the 25 patients could not
      perform the RT tasks when taking placebo, there were no effects of clozapine on
      simple or choice RT compared to placebo or fluphenazine. Subjects on all 3
      treatments showed visual dominance: faster RT to lights than to tones on choice
      and double-stimulus trials. However, clozapine reduced this by means of a
      selective increase in RT to lights. Clozapine reduced failures to respond to the 
      tone on double-stimulus trials. This was shown to be due to reductions in
      hallucinations. Clozapine does not generally improve attention, but it may
      increase the ability of schizophrenic persons to process nondominant or
      unattended stimuli possibly by increasing the efficiency of resource allocation. 
      This may be partially mediated by a reduction in hallucinations.

TI  - Plasma clozapine and haloperidol concentrations in adolescents with
      childhood-onset schizophrenia: association with response.
PG  - 94-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasma clozapine and haloperidol concentrations were studied in
      adolescents being treated for childhood-onset schizophrenia. METHOD: Eleven
      patients (9 boys, 2 girls; mean age = 14.1 +/- 2.1 years) received a 6-week
      blinded or open trial of clozapine. Five patients also received 6 weeks of
      blinded or open haloperidol. Doses were increased on an individual basis to a
      mean 6-week dose of 5.99 +/- 2.6 mg/kg/day for clozapine and 0.24 +/- 0.20
      mg/kg/day for haloperidol. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Bunney Hamburg 
      Rating Scale were completed weekly for each subject. Weekly blood samples were
      obtained during therapy and assayed by high performance liquid chromatography.
      RESULTS: The mean clozapine level at Week 6 was 378.3 ng/mL and ranged from 77.5 
      to 1050 ng/mL. The mean Week 6 haloperidol level was 23.0 ng/mL (range, 6.2-44.3 
      ng/mL). The clozapine desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites achieved mean
      concentrations of 77% and 18%, respectively, of those of the parent compound. The
      mean ratio of haloperidol/reduced haloperidol was 4.48 (range, 0.76-8.76).
      Clozapine concentrations versus clinical benefit exhibited a consistent linear
      relationship among patients (correlation range, 0.26-0.96). Conversely, poor and 
      inconsistent correlations between haloperidol concentrations and clinical effects
      were observed. No relationships were noted between clozapine or haloperidol dose 
      and clinical effects. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with schizophrenia produce a
      greater amount of desmethylclozapine than previously seen in adults. Plasma
      clozapine concentrations appear to be related in a linear fashion to clinical
      improvement.

TI  - Clozapine in treatment-refractory mood disorders.
PG  - 91-3
AB  - Lithium remains the mainstay of treatment for patients with bipolar affective
      disorder; however, nearly half of patients with bipolar disorder fail to respond 
      to lithium. Recently, there have been an increasing number of preliminary
      clinical reports that clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent, has potential
      efficacy in patients with mood disorders. We review the available clinical data
      supporting the potential use of clozapine in these psychiatric disorders and
      report our preliminary data from a study that used clozapine in the acute
      treatment of mania in treatment-refractory patients. Twenty-five patients meeting
      the DSM-III-R criteria for the manic phase of either bipolar or schizoaffective
      disorder entered a 13-week open prospective trial of clozapine. These patients
      either had failed to respond to or had been intolerant to treatment with lithium,
      an anticonvulsant, and at least two typical neuroleptics. Eighteen of 25 patients
      demonstrated a greater than 50% decrease in the Young Mania Rating Scale score.
      These preliminary data as well as the clinical reports reviewed indicate that the

TI  - Effects of clozapine on cognitive function in schizophrenia.
PG  - 82-7
AB  - Cognitive dysfunction may underlie some of the psychopathology of schizophrenia
      as well as contribute to impaired social and vocational function in this
      disorder. Chronic treatment with typical neuroleptics has been reported to
      produce only minimal improvement in and may impair cognitive function in
      schizophrenia. We have studied the effect of clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic
      drug, on cognitive function in 36 patients with treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. In addition, patients with non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia
      were randomly assigned to clozapine (N = 24) or typical neuroleptics (N = 23).
      Cognitive function in the treatment-resistant schizophrenia group was studied
      after 6 weeks and 6 months of treatment, while the non-treatment-resistant
      patients were also studied at 12 months of treatment. Clozapine treatment
      improved several domains of cognitive function, especially attention and verbal
      fluency in both treatment-resistant schizophrenia and non-treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. On the other hand, typical neuroleptic treatment produced minimal 
      improvement in cognitive function. The effect of clozapine on some tests of
      attention and verbal fluency was significantly greater than that of typical
      neuroleptic treatment in non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia. These data
      suggest that clozapine treatment was superior to typical neuroleptics in
      improving cognitive function in schizophrenia. The possibility that this is
      related to normalization of dopaminergic function by clozapine is discussed.

AB  - The importance of persistent negative symptoms in schizophrenia as a limiting
      factor in psychosocial and vocational rehabilitation has been increasingly
      emphasized. As a result, treatment trials and new drug development programs are
      focusing more attention on negative symptoms. Unfortunately, there is enormous
      phenomenological overlap between negative symptoms and neuroleptic-induced
      parkinsonism. We report data from a cohort of 56 clozapine-treated patients
      demonstrating significant correlations between measures of akinesia and anergia. 
      Despite an average drug washout of over 2 weeks, the persistence of drug-induced 
      parkinsonism can confound the assessment of therapeutic drug effects on negative 
      symptoms.

PG  - 63-6
AB  - Eighteen patients with schizophrenia had cerebral metabolic rates assessed with
      positron emission tomography during a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover 
      study of clozapine treatment. Relative metabolic rates were increased in the
      basal ganglia, especially on the right side. In the frontal lobe, metabolic rates
      were lowered, more on the left than on the right. The anterior nuclei of the
      thalamus also showed lower metabolic rates after clozapine. We have previously
      observed patients with schizophrenia to have low metabolic rates in the basal
      ganglia and to lack the normal right > left asymmetry; in this study, clozapine
      normalized striatal activity. In the frontal lobe, asymmetry was normalized, but 
      hypofrontal function was, if anything, exaggerated. This effect in the frontal
      lobe was not observed with haloperidol in earlier studies. The cortical effects
      of clozapine may be related to its unique clinical properties and suggest
      important differences between typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.

      These factors may include clinical variables such as length of illness before

      factors such as rates of drug metabolism. For example, pharmacodynamic
      differences in therapeutic response to haloperidol have been observed between
      Chinese and Caucasian patients. Response rates may also reflect clinical
      heterogeneity, although familiality, history of obstetric trauma, or ventricular 
      enlargement have been not shown to be significant factors. It is also possible
      that genetic differences in receptors that are targets for these drugs may
      influence response.

TI  - 51Cr release assay of clozapine-induced cytotoxicity: evidence for immunogenic
      mechanism.
PG  - 143-8
AB  - Serum drawn from patients during clozapine-induced agranulocytosis was toxic to
      human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Toxicity was produced by an
      immunoglobulin fraction, predominantly of the IgM class. The offending drug was
      not necessary at this stage to produce cytotoxicity. These effects were observed 
      by inhibiting post-phagocytosis glycolysis, by ejection of trypan blue, or by
      enhanced release of 51Cr from lysed-labeled PMNs. Direct chemical toxicity,
      produced by clozapine or its metabolites, was tested by similar procedures. At a 
      concentration of 10(-5) M in a colloidal milieu produced by dilution with AB
      serum, no cytotoxicity was observed; however, in aqueous medium.
      N-desmethylclozapine was toxic to PMNs and proliferating lymphocytes.
      Post-recovery serum appeared to be inert, but cytotoxicity was restored by adding
      clozapine or N-desmethylclozapine to the sensitive patient's serum. At this
      stage, cytotoxicity as measured by 51Cr release was abrogated by anti-IgG or
      anti-IgM. These relationships favor an immunologic mechanism that damages
      peripheral PMNs. Development of colony-forming units-granulocyte (CFU-G) was
      similarly inhibited in normal marrow cultures by cytotoxic serum alone, whereas
      no metabolite had such an effect at the same concentration (10(-5) M).

AB  - Clinical and biological measures were examined for their relationship to clinical
      response to clozapine. Associations were found between therapeutic response and
      the following variables: male gender, paranoid schizophrenia subtype diagnosis,
      older age at onset of illness, shorter duration of illness, higher levels of
      pretreatment acute EPS, low pretreatment CSF HVA/5-HIAA, greater decrease in
      prolactin (PRL) and increase in growth hormone (GH) response to apomorphine
      stimulation pretreatment and greater inhibition by clozapine treatment of PRL and
      GH response to apomorphine, and plasma clozapine levels above 350 ng/mL. These
      results are consistent with other investigators' findings and have practical and 
      heuristic implications for the use of clozapine and understanding its mechanism
      of action.

TI  - Clozapine and noradrenergic function: support for a novel hypothesis for superior
      efficacy.
PG  - 122-5
AB  - Because of its superior clinical efficacy, clozapine is considered the new
      "reference" antipsychotic agent. Currently, there is an intensive investigational
      effort attempting to delineate which of clozapine's many biochemical effects are 
      important for its impressive clinical profile. In this paper, the effects of
      clozapine on noradrenergic function are examined. Preclinical and clinical
      studies indicate that clozapine selectively increases noradrenergic activity and 
      norepinephrine outflow. Moreover, data are presented demonstrating that clozapine
      causes fivefold increases in plasma norepinephrine in schizophrenic patients and 
      that these increases are related to its superior clinical efficacy. A novel
      hypothesis for its superior efficacy is proposed that involves complex actions on
      noradrenergic systems that result in robust norepinephrine outflow. Implications 
      of heightened norepinephrine outflow are discussed.

TI  - Plasma clozapine concentrations as a predictor of clinical response: a follow-up 
      study.
PG  - 117-21
AB  - We investigated the relationship between plasma clozapine concentrations and
      clinical response in treatment-refractory schizophrenic patients. In a previous
      study, we found that plasma drug concentrations above 350 ng/mL maximized
      clinical response in a group of 29 patients. This study represents a follow-up of
      these original 29 patients over approximately 2 1/2 years of clozapine treatment.
      We found that during the initial 6-week trial of clozapine, 38% (N = 11) of the
      patients were considered to be responders. With continued treatment, we found
      that 58% (14 of 24) were classified as responders. Consistent with our previous
      study, we observed that plasma concentrations were helpful in predicting
      response. Five of 7 patients who had unsatisfactory response became responders
      when their plasma clozapine concentrations increased to above 350 ng/mL. We
      conclude that the assessment of plasma clozapine concentrations as a guide to
      dose adjustment may be useful in maximizing response.

TI  - Clozapine in tardive dyskinesia: observations from human and animal model
      studies.
PG  - 102-6
AB  - Clozapine has long been considered a useful treatment in patients who have
      schizophrenia with the neuroleptic-induced delayed-onset side effect tardive
      dyskinesia. We present data in support of the clinical impression using both an
      animal model of the disorder and dyskinetic patients themselves. Clozapine
      produces a lower rate of oral dyskinesia in laboratory rats after 6 months of
      chronic treatment than does haloperidol (8.6 +/- 1.3 vs. 13.6 +/- 1.4 vacuous
      chewing movements every 5 minutes, respectively), suggesting a lower propensity
      to cause tardive dyskinesia. In the human, when clozapine was compared with
      haloperidol in the treatment of patients with tardive dyskinesia, clozapine
      produced significantly greater benefit for motor symptoms after 12 months of
      treatment than did haloperidol (p < .001). Moreover, the dyskinesia rebound,
      which occurred equally in both drug groups at the beginning of the study, was
      sustained in the haloperidol group but lost in the clozapine-treated patients.
      These data suggest that dyskinetic patients lose their symptoms of tardive
      dyskinesia, along with dopaminergic hypersensitivity, with long-term clozapine
      treatment.

TI  - Effect of switching carbamazepine to oxcarbazepine on the plasma levels of
      neuroleptics. A case report.
PG  - 115-6
AB  - Carbamazepine was switched to its 10-keto analogue oxcarbazepine among six
      difficult-to-treat schizophrenic or organic psychotic patients using
      concomitantly haloperidol, chlorpromazine or clozapine. This change resulted
      within 2-4 weeks in the 50-200% increase in the plasma levels of these
      neuroleptics and the appearance of extrapyramidal symptoms. None of the patients 
      showed any clinical deteriotation during the following 3-6 months. The results of
      this case report support the idea that in contrast with carbamazepine
      oxcarbazepine does not induce the hepatic microsomal enzyme systems regulating
      the inactivation of antipsychotic drugs.

AB  - The discovery of antipsychotic medications has revolutionized the treatment of
      schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. However, side effects such as
      extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia have been limiting factors
      in treatment. The introduction of atypical drugs such as clozapine and
      risperidone has ushered in a new era. This article provides an overview of the
      pharmacology, efficacy, and techniques for the clinical use of risperidone, which
      has recently become available.

TI  - The effects of clozapine on neurocognition: an overview.
PG  - 88-90
AB  - Clozapine has proved effective in alleviating a wide range of psychiatric
      symptoms in schizophrenia. Its effects on cognitive function in schizophrenia are
      more variable. Clozapine appears to have a salutary effect on some aspects of
      attention, response speed, and fluency, whereas it appears to have a mild but
      adverse effect on visual memory and some executive functions. This profile may be
      related to the affinity of clozapine for dopaminergic type I and muscarinic
      receptors and relative lack of affinity for dopaminergic type II receptors.

TI  - Predictors of clozapine response in schizophrenia.
PG  - 129-32
AB  - The introduction of the atypical neuroleptic, clozapine, has had widespread
      influence not only on the treatment of the seriously mentally ill patient, but
      also on new drug development and on hypotheses of the pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia. While clozapine differs from traditional neuroleptics in its lack 
      of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), it also is distinct in its profile of
      neurotransmitter receptor affinities. In our work examining the clinical and
      biological effects of clozapine in patients with schizophrenia, we have
      identified the presence of EPS during typical neuroleptic treatment as a
      consistent predictor of subsequent good response to clozapine. Further, our data 
      suggest that clozapine should not be reserved for the most chronically ill
      patients, but rather be utilized in patients with less chronic courses of
      schizophrenia. Biological predictors of clozapine response are consistent with
      dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic facets to its mechanism of action.

TI  - Risperidone. A review of its pharmacology and therapeutic potential in the
      treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 253-73
AB  - Risperidone, a benzisoxazol derivative, is a novel antipsychotic agent which
      combines potent serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptor
      antagonism. Development of the drug was stimulated by reports that the selective 
      serotonin 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin improved the negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia and decreased extrapyramidal symptoms when combined with
      haloperidol. The relatively low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms with
      risperidone may reflect a preferential action on mesolimbic rather than
      nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Recent clinical investigation suggests that 
      risperidone is of at least comparable efficacy to haloperidol and perphenazine in
      improving the symptoms of acute and chronic schizophrenia on short term
      administration. Advantages offered by risperidone over haloperidol include a
      faster onset of antipsychotic action, a lower incidence of extrapyramidal effects
      and possibly greater efficacy against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. If 
      these benefits prove to be maintained during long term therapy, risperidone is
      likely to make a significant contribution to the treatment of schizophrenia.

      of clozapine treatment in nine schizophrenic inpatients. Adrenocorticotropic
      hormone (ACTH), prolactin, and mCPP levels were measured. Clozapine treatment
      completely blocked mCPP-induced ACTH and prolactin release suggesting that
      clozapine blocks serotonin receptors that mediate these hormone responses.

TI  - Risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 825-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy
      of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenic patients and determine its
      optimal dose. METHOD: This double-blind study included 388 schizophrenic patients
      drawn from 20 sites in the United States. Patients were randomly assigned to 8
      weeks' treatment with placebo, one of four doses of risperidone (2, 6, 10, or 16 
      mg), or 20 mg of haloperidol daily. RESULTS: Clinical improvement (20% reduction 
      in total scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia) at
      the study end point was shown by 35% of the patients receiving 2 mg of
      risperidone, 57% receiving 6 mg, 40% receiving 10 mg, and 51% receiving 16 mg;
      and by 30% receiving haloperidol and 22% receiving placebo. Statistically
      significant differences in clinical improvement were found between 6 and 16 mg of
      risperidone versus placebo and versus haloperidol. Positive symptom scores were
      significantly lower after 6, 10, and 16 mg of risperidone and 20 mg of
      haloperidol than placebo; negative symptom scores, however, were reduced
      significantly, compared with placebo, only after 6 and 16 mg of risperidone. The 
      incidence of extra-pyramidal side effects (measured by the Extrapyramidal Symptom
      Rating Scale) was significantly higher in patients treated with 16 mg of
      risperidone or 20 mg of haloperidol than placebo. The results indicate that the
      optimal daily dose of risperidone for most schizophrenic patients in this study
      was 6 mg; this dose was as effective as 16 mg, and the incidence of
      extrapyramidal symptoms in patients receiving 6 mg of risperidone was no higher
      than that in patients receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone is a safe
      antipsychotic that is effective against both the positive and negative symptoms
      of schizophrenia.

TI  - Seizures associated with clozapine treatment in a state hospital.
PG  - 184-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The seizures associated with the atypical antipsychotic medication
      clozapine represent a serious side effect of treatment. In premarketing studies, 
      seizures occurred at a crude rate of 3.5%. It is possible that the rate and
      character of seizures would vary in clinical settings because of differences in
      patient populations or differences in the manner in which treatment is
      administered. We studied the seizures that occurred during clozapine treatment in
      a state psychiatric hospital. METHOD: We reviewed the medical charts and pharmacy
      records of 100 sequential patients who were to start clozapine treatment. The
      review period covered 6 months pretreatment through 1 year of follow-up. RESULTS:
      The patients were 55 men and 45 women, aged 20 to 61 years. Ten (5 men, 5 women) 
      had at least one seizure during clozapine treatment. Seizures occurred at all
      dose ranges (0-299 mg/day, N = 6; 300-599 mg/day, N = 2; 600-900 mg/day, N = 2). 
      Of 12 patients with histories of previous seizures, 4 (33%) had a seizure while
      taking clozapine and anticonvulsants. Of 9 patients with histories of head trauma
      but no seizures, 1 (11%) had a seizure. Of 79 patients without seizure disorder
      or a history of head trauma, 5 (6.3%) had a seizure. Nine of the patients who had
      a seizure continued on clozapine treatment with temporary dose reduction and/or
      addition of an anticonvulsant, 2 having one additional seizure. CONCLUSION:
      Clozapine-associated seizures were more frequent in this group of state hospital 
      patients than they were in premarketing studies. Clozapine-related seizures did
      not preclude successful treatment with clozapine.

TI  - Quantitative effects of typical and atypical neuroleptics on smooth pursuit eye
      tracking in schizophrenia.
PG  - 107-20
AB  - Smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) gain, total saccades, and subtypes of saccades
      were quantified from the visual pursuit tracking of 26 fluphenazine-treated
      patients with schizophrenia and 42 normal controls. Tracking was repeated in 16
      patients who underwent a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover comparison of
      fluphenazine and clozapine. Fluphenazine-treated patients showed significant
      reduction in SPEM gain and significant increases in both total, intrusive, and
      anticipatory saccades and in saccadic amplitude, when compared to controls.
      Clozapine significantly reduced SPEM gain and significantly increased total and
      catch-up saccades, when compared to placebo or fluphenazine. High amplitude of
      intrusive saccades in drug-free patients predicted poor response to clozapine,
      suggesting that intact frontal cortical function may enable optimal clozapine
      response.

TI  - Pharmacologic treatment of schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 529-38
AB  - In contrast to the considerable systematic study of the pharmacologic treatment
      of schizophrenia and mood disorders, the pharmacologic treatment of
      schizoaffective disorder has been relatively ignored. The authors reviewed the
      available literature regarding the pharmacologic treatment of schizoaffective
      disorder. The total number of controlled studies of the acute and prophylactic
      treatment of schizoaffective disorder was small and few used modern criteria to
      define the disorder. In studies of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type
      (manic), lithium and antipsychotics produced comparable albeit incomplete
      responses, except in highly agitated patients when antipsychotics exerted
      superior efficacy. The combination of lithium and antipsychotics appeared to be
      superior to antipsychotics alone for schizoaffective, bipolar type patients. In
      the only controlled study of schizoaffective disorder, depressed type, the
      presumed superiority of combined antidepressant and antipsychotic treatment to
      antipsychotic alone was not found. Although combined antipsychotic and
      thymoleptic treatment represents common prophylactic management of
      schizoaffective disorder in clinical practice, the efficacy of this strategy has 
      not been studied in controlled trials. Advances in the nosology of
      schizoaffective disorder, emerging epidemiologic data demonstrating large numbers
      of patients with this disorder in clinical populations, and preliminary evidence 
      that clozapine may have combined antipsychotic and thymoleptic properties as well
      as efficacy in both the psychotic and affective components of schizoaffective
      disorder, suggest that renewed interest in the diagnosis and treatment of this
      disorder may lead to improved delivery of care for this understudied but
      seriously ill group of patients.

TI  - Clozapine and metabolites: concentrations in serum and clinical findings during
      treatment of chronically psychotic patients.
PG  - 119-25
AB  - Clozapine (CLZ) and metabolites norclozapine and clozapine-N-oxide were assayed
      with a new, sensitive (2 pmol), and selective method in 68 serum samples from 44 
      psychotic subjects, 20 to 54 years old, ill 16 years, and treated with CLZ for
      2.2 years (currently at 294 mg, 3.4 mg/kg daily). CLZ levels averaged 239 ng/ml
      (0.73 microM; 92 ng/ml per mg/kg dose) or 48% of total analytes (norclozapine =
      41% [91% of CLZ] and clozapine-N-oxide = 11%); metabolite and CLZ levels were
      highly correlated (rs = 0.9), and CLZ levels varied with daily dose (rs = 0.7).
      Sampling twice yielded similar within-subject analyte levels (r = 0.8 to 0.9;
      difference = 24% to 33%). Range and variance narrowed when levels were expressed 
      per weight-corrected dose (ng/ml per mg/kg). Levels per dose were 40% higher in
      nonsmoking women than men, despite a 60% lower milligram per kilogram dose in
      women, and did not vary by diagnosis or age in this limited sample. Fluoxetine
      increased serum CLZ analytes by 60%; valproate had less effect. Patients rated
      treatment very positively; observer-assessed benefits typically were more
      moderate. Common late side effects were sialorrhea (80%), excess sedation (58%), 
      obesity (55% > 200 lb), mild tachycardia (51%), constipation (32%), and enuresis 
      (27%); there were no seizures or leukopenia. There was little evident
      relationship of drug dose or serum level to current clinical measures or side
      effect risks.

AB  - The disposition of the atypical clozapine and its desmethyl metabolite were
      evaluated in fourteen male chronic patients. A single 100 mg dose of clozapine
      was administered and blood sampling performed over the following 72 hours. The
      mean (SD) oral clearance and half-life of clozapine were 55.4 (29.7) L/hr and
      13.7 (9.9) hours, respectively. The mean (SD) AUC for clozapine and
      desmethylclozapine was 2389.9 (1406) and 751.1 (622.9) ng.hr/mL, respectively.
      The elimination of the metabolite is rate limited by its formation from
      cloza-pine. A wide interpatient variability in clozapine and desmethylclozapine
      pharmacokinetics was observed.

TI  - Teaching clinical psychopharmacology on an inpatient psychiatric research center.
PG  - 215-21
AB  - In this article we have shown how an inpatient Psychiatric Clinical Research
      Center has been used successfully to teach medical students and residents some
      basic principles of clinical psychopharmacology. Although teaching effectiveness 
      and resident acceptance of the program have not been measured objectively (we
      intend to do this in the next 2 years), informal feedback about the CRC rotation 
      has been enthusiastic. The clinical psychopharmacology curriculum in our
      department has been enhanced by the experience of trainees on a research unit. In
      the rapidly expanding area of psychopharmacology, where new drugs are continually
      coming on the market, the CRC provides an opportunity to demonstrate the
      biopsychosocial model and to explore the interface between the research and
      clinical aspects of psychopharmacology.

AB  - We report the case of a 49-year-old woman with a therapy resistant paranoid
      hallucinatory psychosis and coexisting severe symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
      Over a 3-week period she received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) 10 times, while
      the medication of haloperidol 8 mg/day, thioridazin 90 mg/day, metixen 17.5
      mg/day and biperiden 6 mg/day was continued. There was a general improvement of
      the clinical picture, more pronounced for the parkinson symptomatology than for
      the psychotic disorder.

TI  - Is it possible to predict the clinical effects of neuroleptics from animal data? 
      Part V: From haloperidol and pipamperone to risperidone.
PG  - 269-77
AB  - In 1965 the first study of this series reported different effects of neuroleptics
      in rats, supporting clinical differences. At the one end, haloperidol presented
      as a potent and specific antagonist of the psychostimulants amphetamine and
      apomorphine. Haloperidol-like neuroleptics have marked effects on psychomotor
      agitation, delusions and hallucinations and bind with high affinity to
      dopamine-D2 receptors. Pipamperone, at the other end, presented with weak
      "dopamine" antagonism and more striking tryptamine antagonism. Pipamperone is
      known to improve disturbed sleep, social withdrawal and other symptoms of chronic
      schizophrenia in the relative absence of extrapyramidal symptoms. These effects
      have been attributed to central serotonin-S2 antagonism, on the basis of the
      clinical effects of ritanserin. As shown by the present analysis of relative
      tryptamine versus apomorphine antagonism of 57 neuroleptics, in comparison to
      relative S2 vs. D2 binding, there is a continuity in the series. About 30% of the
      compounds can be considered to act primarily as serotonin antagonists, but few
      are markedly more potent than pipamperone. In amphetamine-challenged rats
      pipamperone-like activity is reflected in preferential inhibition of the
      excessive oxygen consumption rather than of agitation. Risperidone inhibits
      oxygen consumption (0.016 mg/kg) at the same dose as haloperidol inhibits
      agitation. Other low-dose effects of risperidone include reversal of
      amphetamine-induced withdrawal, antagonism of agitation induced by a sequential
      tryptamine and apomorphine challenge and LSD-antagonism. In dogs, the antiemetic 
      activity of risperidone is characterized by high oral effectiveness which lasts
      one day and agrees with pharmacokinetic data when allowance is made for the
      active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The effect of clozapine on plasma norepinephrine: relationship to clinical
      efficacy.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Clozapine is an atypical neuroleptic medication with superior efficacy to
      conventional antipsychotic agents for patients with chronic, symptomatic
      schizophrenia. Neurochemical characteristics that distinguish clozapine from
      other neuroleptics and contribute to its differential efficacy are not known. We 
      assessed the effects of clozapine on plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE) in a
      double-blind, parallel groups comparison of clozapine (n = 11) and haloperidol (n
      = 15) in chronic schizophrenic outpatients who had been previously treated with
      fluphenazine. Simultaneous measurements were obtained for plasma levels of the
      catecholamine precursor dopa, the dopamine metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid 
      (DOPAC), the NE metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), adrenocorticotropin 
      (ACTH), cortisol, and hemodynamic parameters. Clozapine produced marked increases
      (471%) in plasma NE levels, whereas haloperidol had no significant effects on
      plasma NE levels. Clozapine also increased dopa and tended to increase DOPAC
      levels, without effects on DHPG, ACTH, or cortisol levels and without consistent 
      changes in blood pressure. Across patients, the magnitude of clozapine-induced
      increments in plasma NE levels was positively related to improvement in positive 
      symptoms and global symptomatology and was unrelated to the occurrence of
      extrapyramidal symptoms. The results suggest that clozapine differs importantly
      from other neuroleptics in increasing plasma NE levels, with the peripheral
      noradrenergic stimulation related to its superior efficacy profile. The unchanged
      DHPG levels and absence of hypertension suggest a more complex mechanism of
      action of clozapine than heightened NE release alone.

TI  - EEG alterations in patients treated with clozapine in relation to plasma levels.
PG  - 97-100
AB  - It is well known that psychotropic drugs can induce EEG alterations. Dose
      dependence seems established; however, there are no data concerning the impact of
      plasma levels. The authors investigated the influence of clozapine plasma levels 
      on the frequency of EEG alterations. Data from 29 inpatients (18 male, 11 female,
      31.7 +/- 10.2 years) receiving clozapine in a dose range between 25 and 600 mg
      were collected prospectively. There was no psychotropic or anticholinergic
      comedication. All patients had normal EEGs before taking clozapine. Fifteen
      patients showed pathological changes (group 2) and 14 no changes (group 1).
      Discriminant analysis showed that EEG changes are dependent on plasma levels (P =
      0.0009, plasma levels in group 1 mean 81.6 ng/ml, +/- SD 64.6, in group 2 235.7
      ng/ml, +/- 169.8). A total of 72.4% of the patients were correctly classified as 
      having either pathological EEG changes or none by this analysis. Variables such
      as dose, age, sex, weight and duration of treatment were not statistically
      relevant. It can therefore be suggested that clozapine plasma levels are a valid 
      indicator for the appearance of electrophysiological reactions.

TI  - Serum concentrations of clozapine and its major metabolites: effects of

PG  - 123-5
AB  - Serum concentrations of clozapine, norclozapine, and clozapine-N-oxide were
      assayed in psychotic patients treated with clozapine alone (N = 17), clozapine
      with fluoxetine added (N = 6), or clozapine with valproic acid added (N = 11).
      Subjects were matched for age and other treatments, and concentrations were
      corrected for daily dose of clozapine (milligrams per kilogram of body weight).
      With valproic acid, there was a minor increase in total clozapine metabolites,
      which was even less with dose correction. Fluoxetine increased all clozapine
      analytes, in some cases to twice the levels in the subjects given only clozapine.

AB  - Total serum IgE and plasma Interleukin (IL)-4 have been determined in patients
      with schizophrenia, 26 neuroleptic-free, and 81 neuroleptic-treated, and in 46

TI  - Psychopharmacologic treatment of negative schizophrenic symptoms.
PG  - 16-28
AB  - Diverse pharmacologic agents have been reported to be effective in treating
      negative schizophrenic symptoms (NSS). In light of this large and growing
      literature, as well as of reconceptualizations of the underlying pathophysiology 
      of NSS, the time may have come to reject models that assume "irreversibility" of 
      NSS. However, flaws in existing studies prevent closure regarding the
      reversibility of, and by inference the treatability of, NSS. Guidelines for
      future studies are articulated, e.g., the need to distinguish primary from
      secondary NSS, to include drug-free subjects with a predominance of NSS in
      clinical trials, and to use well-validated and psychometrically sound instruments
      for assessing NSS.

TI  - A new five factor model of schizophrenia.
PG  - 299-322
AB  - Schizophrenic psychopathology is heterogeneous and multidimensional. Various
      strategies have been developed over the past several years to assess and measure 
      more accurately discrete domains of psychopathology. One of the more fruitful
      strategies to investigate more homogenous domains of psychopathology has been the
      positive-negative syndrome approach. However, this approach is unable to address 
      a number of important issues. Most schizophrenics present a mixed syndrome; the
      criteria for what constitutes a positive and negative syndrome are variable;
      distinguishing primary from secondary negative symptoms can be difficult. In
      order to address some of these problems, we propose the introduction of a five
      syndrome model based on a reanalysis of factor analytic procedures used on 240
      schizophrenics assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). We
      present data on a 5-factor solution which appears to best fit the
      psychopathological data and which is supported by three independent and
      comparable factor analyses; negative, positive, excitement, cognitive and
      depression/anxiety domains of psychopathology give patients their individual
      mark. Data on internal consistency of the five factors and on initial validation 
      using demographic and clinical variables are presented.

TI  - Childhood-onset schizophrenia: an NIMH study in progress.
PG  - 697-712
AB  - An ongoing study of the phenomenology, genetics, neuropsychology, physiology (eye
      tracking, autonomic responsivity), neuroimaging, biochemistry, and pharmacology
      of childhood-onset schizophrenia is described, and pilot data are presented for
      the first 22 subjects. Differentiation from autism "spectrum" disorders and other
      poorly defined, severe neurodevelopmental disorders is needed. Eye tracking and
      autonomic results are similar to patterns seen in later-onset schizophrenia and
      possibly more striking. Magnetic resonance imaging showed larger left frontal
      ventricular horn area for the schizophrenia subjects, larger left caudate, and
      lack of normal caudate asymmetry. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
      during an auditory continuous performance task revealed decreased right
      parietal/occipital glucose metabolic rate in the schizophrenia subjects, which
      may be secondary to poor attentional performance, and increased glucose metabolic
      rate in three left frontal regions, a left parietal region, and the right
      putamen. Clozapine has been effective and well tolerated in an open trial with 12
      adolescents who responded poorly to typical neuroleptics; 16 subjects have been
      enrolled in a double-blind comparison of haloperidol and clozapine. Longitudinal 
      study of this narrowly defined and possibly more homogeneous group of very
      early-onset schizophrenia subjects will be relevant to current neurodevelopmental
      theories addressing the role of puberty, progression of pathology, and continuity
      or discontinuity with later-onset schizophrenia.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of risperidone in chronic schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 193-7
AB  - In a randomized, crossover study, 24 schizophrenic patients received a single
      4-mg dose of risperidone in caplet or tablet form. Each of the two study periods 
      lasted 5 days. Blood samples to determine (by radioimmunoassay) plasma levels of 
      risperidone and its major metabolite, 9-hydroxy-risperidone (9-OH-risperidone),
      were obtained each day. The two formulations of risperidone were bioequivalent.
      Following are the mean pharmacokinetics of risperidone and risperidone +
      9-OH-risperidone: area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) from 0 to 96
      hours; 278.0 and 716.9 ng.hr/mL; AUC from 0 to infinity, 291.9 and 762.4
      ng.hr/mL; peak plasma concentration, 33.0 and 44.5 ng/mL; time to peak
      concentration, 1.39 and 1.78 hours; and elimination half-life, 14.93 and 23.04
      hours. These results demonstrate that the active moiety (risperidone plus
      9-OH-risperidone) has a half-life of 23 hours and reveal a pool of risperidone
      (terminal half-life, 14.9 hours) that may allow twice-daily or even once-daily
      dosing.

TI  - Risperidone versus clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenic patients with
      acute symptoms: a double blind, randomized trial.
PG  - 129-37
AB  - 1. In order to verify the hypothesis that risperidone is a useful therapeutic
      alternative to clozapine the authors carried out a randomized double blind trial 
      in 59 patients with paranoid hallucinatory psychoses. 2. In a treatment lasting
      28 days three groups of patients received either 4 mg risperidone (N = 20), 8 mg 
      risperidone (N = 19), or 400 mg clozapine (N = 20) daily. 3. The tolerance of 4
      mg risperidone was globally assessed as being better than that of 400 mg
      clozapine. Drop-outs under clozapine were mostly caused by side effects, whereas 
      under risperidone they tended to occur for therapeutic inefficacy. 4. The
      antipsychotic effect was highly significant and clinically relevant under both
      risperidone and clozapine.

TI  - Clozapine treatment of outpatients with schizophrenia: outcome and long-term
      response patterns.
PG  - 1145-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of clozapine in
      treating moderately ill schizophrenic outpatients and to determine the length of 
      medication trial needed to identify responders and nonresponders. METHODS: Rates 
      of clinical responses, relapses and hospitalizations, and levels of
      symptomatology and functioning were assessed for 30 chronic schizophrenic
      outpatients who received clozapine for one year. For some patients, data on
      relapse and hospitalization during treatment were compared with data from the
      year before treatment. RESULTS: Eighteen of the 30 patients met criteria for
      sustained response; 17 of the responders were identified within the first four
      months of treatment. Patients experienced significantly fewer relapses and
      hospitalizations during treatment than in the previous year. Improvement in
      positive symptoms, general symptomatology, and levels of functioning reached a
      plateau during the first six months of treatment and remained at that level
      during the second six months. Negative symptoms and quality of life showed
      nonsignificant improvements at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the use of
      clozapine in treating chronic, residually symptomatic schizophrenic outpatients. 
      A four-month clozapine trial may be adequate to detect clinical responders in
      this population.

PG  - 267-71
AB  - The goal of this study was to assess the time course of change in psychopathology
      and dyskinesia after neuroleptic withdrawal. Fifteen DSM-III schizophrenic
      patients were abruptly withdrawn in a double-blind fashion from stable
      haloperidol treatment. Weekly ratings of dyskinesia and psychopathology were
      performed for 4 weeks post-withdrawal. There was an overall increase in
      dyskinesia ratings over the 4-week period (p < 0.05) beginning in week 2, with
      dyskinetic movements of the fingers showing the most significant increase (p <
      0.001). There were no overall changes in psychopathology, though the group
      appeared to be bimodal with 6 of the 15 patients showing a significant relapse in
      psychotic symptoms. Neither baseline TD nor psychotic relapse significantly
      interacted with change in TD over time. These schizophrenic patients showed an
      increase in global dyskinesia rating early within four weeks of neuroleptic
      withdrawal. This time course did not appear to be associated with reemergence of 
      psychopathology which occurred later. A significant minority of patients relapsed
      within this time period. This suggests the relative safety of brief periods of
      neuroleptic withdrawal for carefully selected patients in a controlled setting
      with specific goals (e.g., for evaluation or in preparation for clozapine) and
      the need to further understand who is at risk for rapid relapse.

      cardiovascular intervention trials. CONCLUSIONS: Reference to large reductions in
      relative risk in review papers, newspapers, and at professional meetings can lead
      to false expectations among clinicians and patients regarding the potential
      impact of the treatment in individual patients. When making decisions about
      preventive drug therapy, clinicians are encouraged to examine measures other than
      relative risk reduction and to include the patient in the decision process.
      Educators should emphasize these other measures of outcome and not rely solely on
      relative risk reduction in discussing particular areas of therapeutics.

TI  - Pharmacoepidemiology of clozapine in 202 inpatients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 1262-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clozapine in a field trial for hospitalized patients with 
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia. METHOD: The setting consisted of a large,
      state-operated, public psychiatric system. The protocol called for the treating
      psychiatrist to provide symptom- and adverse-effect ratings at four times
      following the start of drug therapy. The outcome criteria included the Sandoz
      study outcome measure of symptom improvement as well as discharge status for one 
      year of follow-up. To assess the validity of the ratings, several measures of
      internal consistency were determined. Clozapine therapy was started in 227
      patients, and symptom data are available for 202. RESULTS: Overall, 33 percent (n
      = 66) of the patients were improved at the end of one year of treatment; 12
      percent (n = 24) maintained symptom improvement at all three evaluation times.
      Modest, statistically significant improvement after 12 weeks compared with
      baseline Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores was observed for the 
      patients continuing medication (n = 152); the emergence of a previously
      unimproved group (n = 26) explains this modest improvement. However, in the
      analysis of all patients (n = 202), (including dropouts), there was no
      significant symptom improvement after 12 weeks. Lower baseline BPRS scores
      predicted significant symptom improvement after 12 weeks of treatment. Among
      those medicated for one year, the pattern of symptom improvement showed that the 
      probability of late improvement was 0.26 for those previously unimproved, and the
      probability of a 12-week responder losing improvement was 0.23, resulting in a
      net group gain of 3 cases in 100. By the end of one year, 8 percent (n = 17) of
      the cohort was discharged, and 3 percent (n = 7) was transferred to another
      facility while continuing to receive clozapine. Of the 227 original patients
      started on clozapine therapy, medication was discontinued for adverse effects in 
      11 percent (n = 25): white blood cell count (WBC) decrease (but no
      agranulocytosis) in 5 percent (n = 12), seizures in 1 percent (n = 3), one
      patient with seizures and decreased WBC count, and other events (e.g.,
      cardiovascular changes, fever, or possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome) in 4
      percent (n = 9). Patient refusal was reported for 6 percent (n = 13) of those
      starting treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although only 19 percent of the patients
      exhibited improvement at 6 weeks, the response rate at 12 weeks (29 percent) for 
      this naturalistic study cohort was similar to that in the major, double-blind,
      six-week, controlled, clinical trial of clozapine. The impersistence of response 
      as symptoms were followed for up to one year is a finding that deserves rigorous 
      evaluation.

TI  - Neuroendocrine profile of SDZ HDC-912 and OPC-4392, two new atypical
      antipsychotic drugs, in schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 177-80
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on the activity of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary dopaminergic system of two new atypical antipsychotic
      drugs: the ergoline derivative SDZ HDC-912, which is a dopamine (DA) D2 receptor 
      partial agonist; and the quinolinone derivative OPC-4392, which acts as an
      agonist at presynaptic DA autoreceptors and as an antagonist at post-synaptic D2 
      receptors. The effects of both compounds were compared to the effects of the
      benzamide derivative amisulpride. Prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) levels 
      before and after challenge with apomorphine (Apo), a dopaminergic agonist, were
      determined after at least 2 weeks washout and again after 1 month of treatment in
      DSM-III-R schizophrenic inpatients. SDZ HDC-912 significantly decreased
      Apo-induced PRL inhibition, and tended to decrease PRL secretion and Apo-induced 
      GH stimulation. OPC-4392 induced a significant decrease in baseline PRL and in
      Apo-induced PRL suppression, and a non-significant decrease in Apo-induced GH
      stimulation. The neuroendocrine profiles of these two compounds agree with their 
      dopaminergic properties; however, the decrease in PRL basal level differentiates 
      the two drugs from neuroleptic agents.
